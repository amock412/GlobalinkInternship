0,"I biked from The Old Port to the Atwater Market and I had a great time! The route is very scenic even beautiful at times. There's plenty of path to visit, almost 15 KMs worth of it and its of good quality. The route is urban but surrounded by trees and buildings that went the extra length to be visually appeasing. Very cultural activity if you want to explore Montreal.Most of the terrain is flat with some hills, nothing too difficult. Several maps to check where you're located and a lot of stops to enjoy your time, take a breath and so forth.You can walk it, jog it, run it. I went with the healthy activity of renting a bike for a few hours. Grabbed food from Atwater market and had a picnic. What a wonderful place and worth for activity visitors from out of town to visit and locals willing to explore their city.",5,8/21/2016,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
1,"I am here to review the Lachine Canal bike path. It is glorious! Starting in Old Montreal the path is both adventurous and easy to follow, you can bike it all the way to the western tip of the island I think, but even staying along the Canal throughout Lachine you feel how the city changes. Passing from tight condos into the big public parks along the water's edge feels amazing, and the best pay off is turning around because there is a slight incline while heading west so they way back is smoooth sailing!!",5,7/30/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Canal Lachine
2,"I love the stretch of the Canal between the Old Port and Rene Levesque Park. Specifically, I love the bike path and the parks along this stretch. Great for biking (by me) and running (my partner). Hanging out near the Atwater market or the Old Port on a nice weekend day is pretty wonderful too. Collectively, this represents a big part of our ""easy access"" leisure within Montreal and we cherish living nearby. There have been times where construction along the Canal bike path have impacted our enjoyment of this resource - but most of this is complete now. Yay! Highly recommend spending time around here!!!",5,11/14/2020,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
3,"What can I say other than that this is a great place to jog, bike, walk, and sight see!Of course, I'm only talking about the summer version. You definitely don't wanna be here when it's winter.The paths goes on for miles so you won't run out of length.",4,6/11/2019,Angelo C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SXy__HrBj9GKVycbogRjfA,"Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
4,"Chop chop chop. Parks canada has been repairing the canal walls for 2 years now at great cost. The charm of the area has been lost. The landscaping consists of little hillocks with lawn and saplings grouped together in select areas. Most of the bike path is denuded and any interesting attributes are removed. There are no gardens or meadows left. Birds and bees are gone. It is not environmentally friendly.  The paths are very wide to allow for multi users making the path hot during peak summer season. It us also bitterly cold as we are not protwcted against winter winds. The residents were ""consulted"" but our suggestions were completely ignored. This is not Parks Canada at its best...i am truly disappointed. I am now going to cycle in more beatiful parks that are available like the petit train du nord, ilse de boucherville and chambly.",1,5/16/2019,Elizabeth L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t4bY2yZMYE-3d4O9wda_MQ,"Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
5,"During our scooter tour, we had some time cruising along this canal. Very pretty scenery. It reminded me of all the HGTV House Hunters I've watched that take place in Amsterdam and the outlying countryside. The bike/walking path that travels along the canal is a big plus. Bikes, bikes, bikes, runners, walkers, gazers, you get the idea. The Canal was made by the first colonizers in Montreal as a way to claim the land from the native Indians who ran the land. Very cool history - read or visit for more in depth history! You get views of the entire downtown Montreal from a few points and cool glimpses into the Montreal way of life.",5,6/20/2017,Gwen W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,"Columbus, OH",Canal Lachine
6,"So Beautiful! I started biking from Old Port till Parc Rene-Levesque, and it's just amazing view! Beautiful bridges, and the biking route is surrounded by trees, flowers, and the canal, just beautiful! I took the wrong turns a couple of times, but in general once you follow the other cyclists you should be fine! I usually dont bike for so long, but it's not that tough, its pretty flat, other than some steep roads once in a while but that's it. There's tons of stops along the way, and maps that show you were you are in case you wanna see how long you've biked/walked and basically motivates you! If you don't have a bike yourself, you could rent a bike, and even if there's a problem with your own bike, in Ma Bicyclette they repair bikes, or you could pump the wheels if you need it. There's also a few restrooms on the way, and it's just a great way to spend a couple of hours: healthy, pretty view, nice spots to get drinks(i.e. St-Ambroise Terrace for beer, or Rosi Panini for sandwiches) and just beautiful parcs along the way! It's also nice to discover Montreal more, and there's a kayak place where you can rent kayaks if you want, so much to do along the way in the canal!",5,7/23/2015,Lara S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RMopAcH2eoiOuPkStfg_YQ,"Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
7,"While this may not be as scenic as Old Port or have as many attractions, this is a great place for a walk, jog, or bike ride.  There is a bike path that goes around the entire canal, and the it's not on the road either. It's actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water, so you can bike at a leisurely pace.  In addition, along most of the canal is green space, so if you are tired, you can sit on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.All in all, maybe not an attraction for everyone, but it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",5,8/22/2014,Bernie C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w,"Mississauga, Canada",Canal Lachine
8,I ran here! Loved the walk here and jog. You can literally explore all of Old Montreal by running through here and along the water and into the little streets. Such a great running path!,5,9/9/2016,Elsie W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mDBAmEsyxuVTTT70dK-dqA,"Queens, NY",Canal Lachine
9,"Every city needs a wonderful biking trail.  Canal Lachine is an excellent paved bike path where you can get out be in in nature and enjoy the great outdoors. For me I haven't come here in winter so my experience is only in spring summer and fall.  A fantastic place to go for a bike ride or walk or enjoy the outdoors along the canal. Typically I start just off 32nd ave in Lachine and you can make your way through Lasalle and then pretty much all the way to Old Montreal if you are full of energy. There are fantastic places to stop off along the way for breaks along the river. Bring a picnic in a nap sack or bag, discover different neighbourhoods and enjoy the great Montreal weather as Summer is short in the north. Typically the bike path can be somewhat busy on the weekends but people (from what I've experienced) respect a certain level of etiquette.",4,7/16/2015,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada",Canal Lachine
10,"I biked along and it's a great 2 hour summer activity! The shade from the trees, proximity to water, wind in your hair...It is also fun to watch the rollerbladers and other less conventional transportation.",4,8/8/2017,Mei W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z4qxqNBKv-9-rJIIPr5ldg,"San Diego, CA",Canal Lachine
11,I came here with my family on Christmas since most things in the city are closed. So glad we decided to take a walk along this canal!! It's really beautiful. There is a walking path and a separate bike path along both sides of the canal. There are placards along the canal describing the history of the area. It's a really lovely walk that I can't recommend enough.,5,12/25/2015,Joanna V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WC1m2B-bXg1g57AyvzAL-Q,"Brooklyn, NY",Canal Lachine
12,"The Lachine Canal is a great place to be if you're a runner, walker or cyclist.  As a runner this is my favourite spot to come for a good, long run.  The path is 14.5 km long which is ideal if you're looking to cover a long distance and not have to be always stopping for traffic lights or looking out for cars.   If you're in the Atwater Market area then you should consider picking up some food and having a picnic along the Canal",5,5/12/2014,Julia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,"Montreal, Canada",Canal Lachine
13,"This must be one of the nicest parcs in the city it runs along the Lachine Canal from old Montreal to the old Lachine village. As I use to work in old Montreal and live in Point-Saint-Charles, I would ride my bike to work along the the canal bike path from the month of March until the first snow. Theres nothing like riding home on a sunny friday afternoon after a long week, talk about stress relief. The canal also has green space on either side of the bike path allowing for people to sit and enjoy the views of the city and take in sum sun. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the best places for a picnic, with it's proximity to the Atwater market it's easy to run over grab some bread and cheese, find a quiet spot and enjoy a nice quiet lunch.My only complaint, if you can even call this a complait is that the parc is all but closed in the winter, it would be nice if the bike path was maintained in the winter. I'm sure people would use it to comute all winter long, it might also be nice if cross-country ski tracks would be set ove the 14km length. It,s not a complaint, It's a ""would be nice if"" Just get out and enjoy it, we're lucky to have this parc .",5,12/22/2011,J.F.
