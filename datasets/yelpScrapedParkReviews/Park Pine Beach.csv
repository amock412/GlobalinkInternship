0,"I loved this part of our trip. We came here right around sunset, the park was quiet but alive with couples and people just enjoying the outdoors and the beautiful park. There were also bugs. Lots and lots of bugs! The playground was cute and looked like it could entertain a kid for a few hours! There was some water toys that would have been a ton of fun on hot summer days. The view of the water was beautiful and made me feel at peace. I am surprised there are no yelp reviews of this place yet! I am very happy to have noticed this place on google maps as we tried to find our way around town.",5,9/9/2017,Nicole G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6S2hVlEHOdlwaRphc_8U4g,"Milton, VT",Park Pine Beach
