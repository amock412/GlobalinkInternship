0,"Cannot believe that me, someone who reviews like every park ever...has NOT reviewed this park yet?!  This is but one of a few serious head scratchers I've come across recently. We're fixin that right now.So this park is technically actually ginormous and constitutes the whole entire LaSalle Blvd riverside park from the Verdun border (Parc l'Honorable Georges O'Reilly) all the way to Parc de l'Aqueduc. I've tried numerous times, to no avail, to find some other hidden park name throughout this vast space, but so far nada. Particularly though, the spot you really wana check out in this park, and the reason it deserves more than all 5 stars, is the bird sanctuary island: at the corner of 6th/7th avenue and Blvd LaSalle. The rapids are intimidatingly astonishing and close enough to drown in here and the whole tiny island is full of different birds and sometimes other wildlife. Great picnic options, great photo options, extremely relaxing, beautiful and enjoyable! Bikes are not permitted on the island and must be parked at the bike rack at the entrance, so bring your bike lock. (There are still A-HOLES that don't respect this and think it's fine to walk their bikes through, but please don't be like those ppl - you'll disturb the bird habitats and make it difficult to walk around each other on the path as well as cause traffic). It's a beautiful spot to bird watch, practice photography, do yoga, picnic or to enjoy the rapids in all their glory without getting wet (necessarily). It's an excellent, well worth the price tag of ZERO, activity for the whole family or the couple in love to enjoy.Up until recently dogs were not allowed in any part of this park, now pooches are allowed in the park by the riverside, but still not allowed to bring your furchildren with you on the sanctuary island at 6th avenue (for obvious reasons). I have taken many many photos at my stops at this park so let them speak for me. I will leave it at this: if u live in Mtl, or if ur visiting Mtl and you believe Parc Lafontaine etc. is impressive or worth your time, and you have not yet discovered this park: it is DEFINITELY worth making the trek over, you have definitely been missin out on somethin' special.Of course I say that knowing one day I'll be b*tching that the spot got too popular and ppl are ruining it. *le sigh* Enjoy with respect folks okodoki?!",5,5/17/2019,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc des Rapides

2,"IMPORTANT FOR DOG OWNERS: Ok park, but Not Pet Friendly at All. They do not even allow small dogs in backpacks or other carriers.",1,5/20/2018,A A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-Yb1srF4RYtpn-6Yp8ojRg,"New York, NY",Parc des Rapides
3,"This is Montreal's ""other"" Park.While many have already written about and described and visited Montreal's Mont Royal Park, I'd like to divert people's attention to another of Montreal's park's and the better one in my opinion as well.The Parc des Rapides is located in the southern Montreal borough of Lasalle and without a car, it's not all that difficult to get to. Just go to De L'Eglise Metro station (Green Line) and catch the 58 ouest. Better yet, jump on the Verdun bike path which runs along the river and it will literally take you there.A giant bird sanctuary, thunderous, roaring river rapids, adventurous kayakers, Stand-Up Paddling in the basin, fly-fishing, families out for the day, photographers, couples making out in the bushes, students studying under a shade of the tree, painters, random landscape sculptures, you will literally find it all here. I actually prefer this park to Mont Royal because of the dramatic setting in the middle of the St. Lawrence River and the crashing white water rapids all around you. It just somehow feels cooler and you feel you're nowhere near the city. The landscape designers have done a stellar job here of interspersing the trees, bushes, flowers, and sculptures. You're bound to find your own little place somewhere here to just chill, pic-nic, read a book or meditate. Pack a lunch and come here and if you didn't, no worries, there's a great Italian restaurant across the street as well as an ice-cream bar. Come here, chill, relax, watch the ducks, geese, herons and other birds. Montreal may be one of the unique cities in the world which is located close-by to white river rapids so  why not come check it out? This is a wonderful place which not many outsiders know about but should and deserves more attention from locals and visitors alike.",5,6/11/2014,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc des Rapides
4,A great FREE attraction which is also located in a reasonable distance from a metro so thats another plus. The nice park (or parc) is at the edge of a lovely canal walk and what I like about it is that during the summer you see people there enjoying the sun and during winter you can come there and see huge chunks of ice floating on the river..breathtaking.,5,12/13/2015,Tomer N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,"Ottawa, Canada",Parc des Rapides
