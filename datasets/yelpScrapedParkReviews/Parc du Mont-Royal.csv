0,"This is a winter review.  For all winter activities like snowshoeing, tubing, cross-country skiing, skating, you can check the conditions on the website: lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act…It costs adults $20 for 2 hours of ski or snowshoe rental.  They offer 3 sizes: S, M, L.  You simply need to reserve online and pay upon pick up at the rental trailer close to the Pavillion.  The snowshoe trail is loosely indicated and takes you all the way to the back of the Montreal General Hospital at the halfway point and circles back to Beaver Lake.  It's got uphills and downhills so it's a good workout.  Depending on the trail conditions, it can take as little as an hour or up to 2 hours to complete this trail.  With the trail a bit compacted by earlier trekkers, the trail only took us 1.5 hour to complete. Parking availability isn't too bad in the winter as people are coming and going constantly so spaces free up periodically.  That's because there's only so much snow activity that one can have in a day.  I think it would be much more difficult to find parking in the summer when people want to stay longer. The parking wasn't cleared so the snow was pretty thick in the lot.  Fun place to bring your own gear to trek across the snow, slide down the small slopes, your dog for a walk or skate on the refrigerated rink.  The skating ring has the longest lines as they limit the number of people allowed on the ice.  On a Saturday afternoon, there were probably a few dozen of people waiting in line for the skating rink.",5,1/16/2021,Aimee H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
1,"Parc du Royal has a character all on its own and it's the place to go if you're looking for an awesome Montréal scenery. It's like NYC's Central Park- except Parc du Royal has that high peak almost giving you that 360° panoramic view. Postcard-perfect views? Hell yeah. We've visited the park on our first Autumn Montréal trip a few years ago, then a few more times during the winter after that- and the landscape is just jaw-dropping and gets better every time. We've driven up, but this is the kind of park where you can seriously take it up several notches and work your quads on a hike or just a quiet stroll if you want. Parc du Royal brims with tons of loops, turns, entrances and exits. It's like the heart and soul of this area where it gives us a true taste of the park life.",5,8/23/2020,Mercedes C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,"Bronx, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
2,"This park provides a fun amount of physical activity while hilking to the top, and a rewarding picturesque view from the top, of Downtown Montréal. I would definitely recommend this as a Must for tourists given that it is just a couple blocks from the Montreal museum of fine arts and McGill University. For those who are with someone not afraid to go to the top at dusk or at dawn I truly recommend hiking to the top near sunset it sunrise to get the perfect photo. I cannot really comment on anything besides the view from the look out as it is all I really saw while at the park. encore une fois en françaisCe parc offre une activité physique amusante tout en se hissant au sommet et une vue pittoresque enrichissante du haut du centre-ville de Montréal. Je recommanderais certainement cet endroit comme un must pour les touristes étant donné qu'il se trouve à seulement quelques pâtés de maisons du musée des beaux-arts de Montréal et de l'Université McGill. Pour ceux qui sont avec quelqu'un qui n'a pas peur d'aller au sommet au crépuscule ou à l'aube, je recommande vraiment de marcher jusqu'au sommet près du coucher du soleil au lever du soleil pour obtenir la photo parfaite. Je ne peux pas vraiment commenter autre chose que la vue depuis le belvédère car c'est tout ce que j'ai vraiment vu au parc.",5,8/28/2020,John S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xHMq2fBArXBp881TVlRt5g,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
3,"Parc du Mont-Royal or Mount Royal Park is like the Central Park of Montreal. Unlike several city parks, however, this one contains a mountain. It's a small mountain just west (only a couple blocks) of downtown Montreal. The city of Montreal got its name from Mount Royal. Pronounce it like ""Mont Royale"" and you'll see what I mean. Mont Royale, Montreal. The park is huge, covering almost 700 acres, and the mountain rises as high as 764 feet.We stayed in an Airbnb on the east side of the park, pretty much on McGill University campus, on Aylmer St. We walked from our Airbnb, past Percival Molson Memorial Stadium and McTavish Reservoir, and hiked to one of the high points on the mountain: Chalet du Mont-Royal (yelp.com/biz/chalet-du-m…). I highly recommend it. I'm not sure where else you can get such elevated and wide-sweeping views of the Montreal city skyline.From where we started, at Pine Ave W and Peel St, the hike took us less than 45 minutes and it was a leisurely hike. We took breaks to rest and take in views as well as took a detour to see the Mount Royal Cross. The Mount Royal Cross is in an opposite direction, but not far from, the chalet. The Mount Royal Cross isn't giant like Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. It's a simple 36-foot-tall see-through cross with light bulbs on it. If you're headed to the chalet, you might as well check it out. The founder of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve, placed the original cross on Mount Royal in 1643 to thank God and the Virgin Mary from sparing the colony from flooding.I think if you take a brisk, non-stop walk from where we started, you can reach the chalet in 20 minutes or less, certainly 30 minutes or less. We did encounter one nice city view on the way up and back down, between the chalet/cross and our starting point. The park, in general, was clean and not much differentiated it from other public parks in major cities. The trails were mostly dirt/gravel. There were benches throughout the park. On a Saturday evening around sunset, it was busy with a diverse mix of people -- locals, tourists, students, families, young, old, etc. You do have to climb a decent amount of stairs so I wouldn't recommend this hike for the elderly.On the way down, the trails lacked adequate lighting, so we used the lights on our phones to help us see.",4,2/8/2020,Daniel B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,"Atlanta, GA",Parc du Mont-Royal

5,"Beautiful little park in the Montreal metropolitan area. This place is beautiful during the dark of winter as well as in the heart of summer. Watching the snow fall during the winter is so magical, almost like being in a snowglobe - here in the summer, there's usually pianos set up for people to play music, people strolling about enjoying the weather, and a gorgeous view of the city from the top.",5,8/14/2020,Carol L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LKaEiBYGBnB8Df1hUyEnLA,"New York, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
6,"We did not come to Montreal prepared to climb a mountain, so when the kids suggested we do so on our recent vacation, we had to take our city-clothed not-too-young selves up that mountain.  Note: There are two possible ways up that we discovered.  (I'm sure there are a million more).  One is to wind your way up wood-side where you run into a cafe that has swings and tables a third of the way up.  The other way is to take stairs all the way up.  We were glad we took the woodsy approach, although I must confess I was a bit concerned to discover that we still had two thirds of a mountain to go when we reached that cafe.  The view was already gorgeous. I could have been perfectly content at that point, but by golly up to the top we had to go! I DID it.  This old gal might have been slower than the other three, but I huffed and puffed it up and made it back down those gazillion stairs.  So however you make it to the top (lots and lots of folks took vehicles, do know there is a bathroom inside a small cafe (down yet more stairs), where you will also see a teeny museum that will let you know it's not really a mountain, but a mere remnant of something that I can't remember, because my brain couldn't fathom that I had climbed anything less than a MOUNTAIN.  NOTE:  we weren't the only people who got lost trying to figure out how to come down.  There was a detour sign that appeared to go up instead of down.  After trusting our instincts (WRONG), we had to turn around and go back to that detour sign and actually follow it, which led us to those stairs that most others were using to go up and down anyway.  Killer stairs.  Lots of them.  We were glad to be going DOWN.  Overall it was a very enjoyable hike with a sense of accomplishment for this Gal who is not known for her outdoorsy ways.",4,11/23/2019,Lori R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,"Raleigh, NC",Parc du Mont-Royal
7,"Mount Royal Park is beautiful and worth a visit, whether you're coming in the summer or winter to visit Montreal. It's a beautiful park with many  trails with vantage points at the top overlooking the entire city. In the winter, there are opportunities to snow shoe though the trails and both winter & summer offer opportunities for a beautiful overlook of downtown Montreal.So how do you get to the overlook? In my instance, daylight was running out and I simply Ubered to the Chalet and then walked down from there. You can do this, find a trail to walk to the top or take the stairs directly up. Either way - definitely carve out some time to explore this park when you're in Montreal!

10,"Just essential big huge green space in these crazy times. The air, the wide open spaces, they're just what we all need right now. The most fun bike ride you can do is to do the work all the way up to the top and then enjoy coasting (flying) down the wide paved trails that wind from top to bottom. This wild fun relieves some of the stress built up right now, especially when you do it at dusk and shoot out into the cool evening streets of Montreal.",5,7/30/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
11,"Parc du Mont Royal is a must when you visit Montreal. If you want a (free) view of the city, this is the place to see it. It's about a 20-minute hike up many, many stairs but it's not terrible. It's doable. Just make sure you go on a cooler day, and you have plenty of water at hand. They have other, longer trails, but we didn't have the time or energy to do those. We drove to the park, and were able to find (paid) street parking nearby pretty easily.I saw in some of the other reviews that it's a great nighttime view, so if I ever return to Montreal, I'll give that a shot!",5,8/27/2019,Mel T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,"Hoboken, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal
12,This afternoon I walked to and climbed up to the top of Mount Royal (I've done it a few times in the past).The stairs are at the top of Peel Avenue.  It's not an easy climb up!  There is some repair going on so I had to detour along a path. The view of the city are worth the climb!Heading down was a lot easier than going up!,5,9/25/2019,Teena D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal

14,"One of the true gems of the city, Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park) is a must visit for any first timer to Montreal or someone looking to get a great view of the city. A large series of hills created as a result of a volcanic eruption hundreds of years ago, this area has become a symbol of the city and a mountainous landmark defined by its history.There are a number of ways to navigating through this magical place. First, one can hike / walk / climb their way to the top. It will take time and is a good group sweat-together activity. The leisurely, scenic route is through the woods where there are various group friendly sites along the way. There are a number of other trails, but those take even longer. Going up through the stairs is the more direct route and is a great way to enjoy the view, but remember there will almost always be people behind who will have to go at your pace. Bring a little water and some nice shoes.Then there is the bus. For a handful of dollars ($10?), one can ride the bus from downtown Montreal (#11 or #711) all the way to the top in very little time. This is particularly handy for those who are in a slight rush and is the preferred option for most tourists. There are a number of sites throughout the mountain, but the Chalet is the one that most folks are gunning for. It has an incredible view; the picturesque one that is on virtually every postcard. On top of that there is a cafe with food / drink, bathrooms, and a place for souvenirs. Good weather months are clearly the time to go, though I'm told winter time there are a lot of fun activities happening all around the mountain. Tourists are going to be in full force, which means photos / selfies without someone in them might be a challenge.",5,12/15/2019,Jando S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,"Queens, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
15,"A absolutely beautiful place to people watch and see the views. You need to be in pretty good shape for the hike, lots of steps. There are bathroom facilities when you reach the top and a restaurant, just snacks. There is also a water fountain to refill your water bottle.

16,"I'm so ashamed of myself.  My friends and I tried to walk to the top of the hill but we gave up and called an Uber..LoL I blame the heavy brunch we had minutes before visiting that made us sluggish. I thought it was pretty cool that the park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the person who also designed New York's Central Park. We came mid-day on a Saturday and it was filled with other tourists, joggers, picnickers, dog walkers and bicyclists. We stayed at the overlook for awhile and took pictures of one another before venturing off down the walking path. I really appreciate quiet moments with nature in the heart of the city. If I lived in Montréal this would definitely be a place I'd come to recharge. Not on a weekend of course. It's way too crowded with tourists. Maybe at sunrise. I'm sure that would be beautiful.",4,10/31/2018,Brooke F.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TulmqD11y9PX3ISUWRRktA,"Washington, DC",Parc du Mont-Royal
17,"Our day in this park was a picture perfect Spring day. It seemed that all the students from the nearby universities were there sunning themselves trying to catch some rays after a long harsh Canadian Winter. The sun beams warmed our backs as we strolled through the numerous pathways that the park offers. We enjoyed listening to the native children speak French and tried to understand what they were saying with our limited command of the language. I actually did better reading signs...like where to pay for park parking which was very reasonable.The walk around the lake was very picturesque. There are also a few museums in the park. You can get information on that at the Visitor's Center near the parking area.Once we left the park, we found a viewing area where you can see the whole city of Montreal. It was a great place to take pictures!",5,5/5/2019,Kathy C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9GUuNKZinw7JxT2nG3jSmg,"Brooklyn, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
18,"Since it was a humid day, we took the bus (i.e. Bus# 11) to get to Mount Royal. We found that there's two areas where you can see the view of Montreal.1) Bus stop ""Belvedere Camillen-Houde"": This would be the Mount Royal Lookout and you'll mostly see trees and some of the buildings. 2) Bus stop ""Remembrance / Chemine du Chalet"": This would be Mount Royal Chalet area. This is the place to be and you'll see the NICE view of Montreal. The chalet has restrooms, a cafe, and a small gift shop too.We also hiked a trail to see the Mount Royal Cross. It was a bit difficult to find even though I used Google Maps to navigate. I wished there were more signs along the trail tho.Overall, I could come back to Mount Royal if I visit Montreal during fall season just to see the foliage. I'm sure the view be a lot prettier with colorful leaves.",4,9/15/2018,Linda T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RXIeMdM988krQQDj6cXwJQ,"Queens, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
19,"The mountain is a must see when in Montreal. Think of it like a Central Park up the mountain. A few stairs up from the street level to get to the trail walkway. The walkway is a gradual slope or you can take the stairs that cuts through parts for a short cut. There are also small narrow paths through the trees, this is quite steep and you need to watch your steps a bit. Some people say the walk up the mountain is 30-45 minutes, which I don't understand. We spent almost four hours walking up, walking around at the top and then down.When you walk up, the first building you reach is Maison Smith which has a free exhibition, a cafe that serves sandwiches, quiche and such. Public access to the restrooms downstairs. There was no Wi-Fi to connect to. Legs were killing and an uber ride back down would have been nice lol. There is a very nice lake area just next to Madison Smith. Then you can keep walking up and shortly after reach the Mont Royal Chalet, where you can get great views and photo opportunities of the city skyline and gaze across the river and mountains. The chalet looks a bit like an old style train station hall inside, again here there is a cafe that serves coffee and cakes. The restrooms are downstairs under ground. There is a walkway that takes you in a loop around the mountain top. I wish there were more walkway options that take you down to different parts of the city without having to cut through the very steep and hard to follow paths. Also wish the signs would show distances between each part of the mountain better. At the top there is a cross, Eiffel tower style, obviously a lot smaller, something to do with the founders of the city, although I believe they didn't reach the top, rather just the plateau. I would recommend skipping the cross unless you do the full loop around where you will see it anyway. It looks like a construction element rather than a commemorative cross. They could have done something more graceful with this one. If you happen to go up in one of the high rise building in downtown, you can see the cross at the top. There are a lot of local joggers making their way from the bottom to the top.",4,10/6/2018,Matt G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=188nNkbt92KZoF4QtF7ApQ,"Morrisville, NC",Parc du Mont-Royal

That is a mission and a half, especially after first climbing the giant straight up street before the mountainside. #BePrepared #Hydrate #HydrateAgainBut once you're up...It's quite lovely at the top. Views are nice. Lots of little ""dicky dee"" ice cream and drink people in the main areas. Had a Art Pop in pina colda flavour the Friends of Mont Royal stand. However, dont suggest the lime coconut flavoured one. We all agreed it wasn't great.Chanced a 2nd visit a couple months after my first ever visit. Stairs up was way easier when properly hydrated! Take a look inside the building at the top! The cafe is totally worth a stop. It's at the opposite side of the building from the view. Their pastries and coffee are excellent. The date square definitely hit the spot!Once you head out on the paths, it's super easy to take a wrong turn though.

Numerous picturesque views of the city as well. It's a little slice of natural paradise in a big city.Of course, no visit is complete without the required photo op at the top with the Montreal skyline in the background. Parking is reasonable: $3/hour but only $10/24 hours max. Personally, we like to drive up and then walk down into town and eat out way through the city, then burn it all off by trekking our way back, all uphill.It's a favorite locale to visit when in Montreal and well worth it.",5,6/1/2018,Stephanie S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5FJSrMA8z-ZxkXPhV-72OA,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
22,"This was an excellent experience during our visit to Montreal. We were staying in a downtown hotel hotel so just check up Rue Peel to the main entrance to the never-ending stairwell up to the top view.  It was a sunny blue sky day so the walk up, the breezes through the trees, and the subsequent view from the top was absolutely amazing. Remember to take bottled water with you to remain hydrated. At the top, the atmosphere was nice and as is the case with many of the parks, there is a piano player at the top creating a really nice atmosphere and ambience. We traversed the 339 steps to the top where we went to the Kondiaronk lookout as well as the Mount Royal Chalet. If you're not up for the stairwell up to the top, consider the bike pathway to the top which I'm sure is much easier.  A truly memorable experience and great way to get some of that fresh Montreal air!",5,7/1/2019,Ethan T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,"Orlando, FL",Parc du Mont-Royal
23,"Seeing the photos of sweeping views of Montreal from Mont Royal I knew I had to make the climb during my visit. I had an uber drop me off in front of Maison Smith which is pretty much where the path starts to walk up. Its a very big park with lots of parking and many lookout spots. The day I visited Mont Royal was the first really nice day Montreal has had in awhile. It has been a long winter and you could tell how happy people were to finally get some sunshine and be in temps greater than zero. That being said there were lots of people enjoying the outdoors. Tons of folks were hiking the paths with families and dogs.  It really isn't a far climb to the main lookout spot. Approx 10 mins at an average pace. You get amazing views of the city and great photos here. There is a lodge with a cafe, gift shop, bathrooms. There are many paths that venture from the main one for hikers to explore. The main path also continues further to reach the cross (croix du mont royal).

It was pretty steep (which was not ideal at times since I'm afraid of heights!), but the breathtaking view was totally worth it! Once I made it to the top, I was so happy with myself! :)There was a stop about halfway up the hill to purchase water bottles and ice pops at a fairly reasonable price. My suggestion is to still bring your own water bottle along though. I wish I had brought one to keep myself hydrated the whole way!Not in for the full hike? No worries! You can drive part of the way up so that's an option!Whatever you decide, Parc du Mont-Royal is definitely worth your time!

The key overlook that provides you with the ""money shot"" of the downtown skyline directly beneath you, however, is a short walk off the main drive behind the chalet.Currently, there is a tremendous amount of construction along park roads, so traffic going in and out (even buses) can be severely delayed. So, skip the exhaust fumes and make a nice, hilly hike out of it.",5,8/5/2017,Vincent L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,"Oakland, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
34,I think this is the central park of Montreal. We took the 11 bus to get here and we walked around taking the nice weather and view and the lookout point. it was packed on the weekend when we went. i would not recommend driving here. I would maybe walk up to park if I had a hefty breakfast or a normal breakfast for my standards. There are restroom downstairs the visitor center. The water fountain works and spits out CLEAN crisp clear water.Needs a korean taco trunk near the bus spot. Then this park gets a fifth star.,4,9/10/2017,Chris L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EpIlKrJJBOkBrX01Ms-i0Q,"Westfield, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal

37,This is truly the best part of Montreal for me!  So much greenery and nature and hiking in a big city is almost unheard of and Parc Du Mont-Royal really delivers.  You literally feel transported to another place and we loved the peace and tranquility that it offers.  My favorite part is the chalet and there are many paths to reach it including those infamous stairs.  We ended up having Uber drop us off at a different lookout point towards the bottom of the park and walked about 45 minutes to reach the destination.  That path is easy and relaxing so if you are with kids or the out of shape friends or the elderly or people wearing sandals (me) then I would suggest taking that route.,5,7/11/2019,Monica G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xxB5F6TJ4J1MlNufCdqz2Q,"Alhambra, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
38,"Beautiful park, very open and spread out. If you are a serious walker then you can cover a lot of ground. If not, I'd suggest driving and parking around the various stops the park. We stopped at the Smith Maison and the Summit.Something I learned is that the Summit is where the overlook is. The overlook is the highest point in Montreal with the best views. There seemed to be some confusion on what spot this was on TripAdvisor so, to be clear, it's the SUMMIT. There is a pretty decent stair climb to get to the top. We got a bit turned around because of the different signs we tried to follow and wandered through some pretty slippery / muddy trails. Had to be extra careful. Not for the faint of heart. When you reach the top it's a beautiful open air almost amphitheater like area. There were street performers and people selling (slightly overpriced) ice pops. The environment is fun and people are sitting around, relaxing, and enjoying the sun.Tip: there are bathrooms located in the large building up the steps.To me, it was well worth the hike.

41,"We three sisters enjoyed our climb up through and almost to the top of Mount Royal (Parc du Mont-Royal) Park (there is a cross on the true top of it, a bit higher up than the welcome center). We chose the stairs which are very well maintained, not overly strenuous, but, if you need a break there a few landings on which to do so. Try early morning to avoid the crowds. The view from the promenade at the ""top"" are of Downtown, and other parts of the city, as well as the St. Lawrence River off to the left. Make sure to stop in at the beautifully restored chalet-like visitor center; not only does it have activities for kids (telescope, coloring pages, etc.), but stuff to keep us adults entertained and educated also. And bathrooms. And a cafe. And a gift shop.The ceilings and woodwork are beautiful. Not sure if the story I was told was correct, but I heard that these were former Canadian Mounties barracks.

42,"At the top of this city-park mountain you can breath in fresh air! There's several trails starting at various points on the big hill, and meander down to the street level. We visited this park in the late afternoon on a Wednesday and it was quite populated. Both locals out for a walk and tourists walking around searching for that perfect picture. Awesome panoramic views of Montreal! What looks to be the most popular lookout gave a 180 degree picture of downtown montreal and many of the ethnic neighborhoods around the city. The Observatory Lookout gives a different scope of the island, including their Olympic stadium, which is now used for sporting events, concerts, etc. it's open to the public, which I think is awesome that it's not just another defunct Olympic structure that once was, and now is nothing (Beijing!). I liked the Chalet building near the summit of the mountain. The stone on the outside. Gorgeous high wood beams lining the entire open hall, on the inside. There's a gift shop inside that has Shirts, postcards, pictures, and trinkets. Also, at the other end of the open hall is a guest services desk that has cool FREE males of the islands!!",5,6/18/2017,Gwen W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,"Columbus, OH",Parc du Mont-Royal

Took the road back to an overlook of the city after dark. Great views!! There were a few groups of uni kids hanging around drinking beer and smoking pot; although they didn't bother us, it might be a concern for some.

It had AC which was great and a nice escape from the heat.I would recommend walking it earlier in the morning since when we got there at noon, it was filled with tourists. All my videos had the background noise of the tourists talking or tourists in the view. If you love dogs, people walk their dogs along the trail, too.

48,Awesome view of Montreal from atop. There's two ways to get to this viewpoint. One is to park  on Pins Avenue and hike up about ten flights of stairs (it took us about 20 minutes). It's a great work out and the view will literally be breathtaking. The other way is to park at the lot near the top and walk less than ten minutes to the viewpoint. I've done both and I would recommend the stairs if you want a good workout and recommend the closer parking lot of the less physically fit people.They have a restaurant of some sort at the top for you to buy refreshments if you get hungry.

49,"The Mont-Royal Park in Montreal is the quintessential spot to see the city. It is a great starting point for any trip to the beautiful city, and gives you a sense of the expanse of the metropolis. It is great any time of year, even in the sweltering heat of mid-summer. Bring some water, and take note of parking spots, as you don't have to force elderly members of your party to hike far if you know where to park. It's a beautiful area, and very popular, without feeling overly crowded. The main point of interest is definitely the lookout point over the city, but there are plenty of trails, green grass, and even a reservoir to explore. It's the perfect spot for a mid morning walk, an afternoon saunter, or for a great view of the sunset.",5,9/23/2016,Michael B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gk7QzENtPjq6gRznGkvcOA,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

Since then, we visit quite frequently and especially come to watch the sunset over a picturesque Montreal skyline! We always go to the peak where everyone is just taking pictures or chilling, enjoying the fresh air from up above!

52,"The hike up to the Chalet of Mount Royal is a sweaty workout but definitely manageable.  The view is worth the sweat and tears!  The photos do not do it justice since they lack the spatial element.  There is so much open space and sky up at the Chalet. My friend and I took the most direct path up Peele Street from McGill's campus.  We walked on gravel and climbed up a lot of wooden steps.  There was more climbing than walking so we didn't find wearing flats to be a large issue but the small pebbles do get annoying.   99% of the people wear sneakers/athletic shoes so I recommend bringing an extra pair of shoes if you can.  At one point, there was a continuous staircase of 256 steps, which was the final set before arriving at a flat surface near the Chalet.  It was an intense 15-minute climb in total!From the Chalet, most people walk to the famous Cross.  We headed to bus #11 instead, which took us down to Le Plateau neighborhood.  It's a charming area with a lot of colorful houses, their winding staircases to the second level (French architecture?), murals, coffee shops, boutiques, and the famous Schwartz's Deli for smoked meat (pastrami).",5,6/3/2016,Jing X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A08xF_ykmsWQV0ypYA8wkA,"Brooklyn, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal

I guess I wanted to get away from the tall buildings that I see in Miami.After I walked over the Beaver Lodge (I think its called) to go snow tubing. There wasn't enough snow to ski but this was so much fun! It was 9 Canadian dollars a person to use a tube the entire day. And if you had your own sled you could spend the day there for free I think.

We Ubered up the hill to the cafe. On the way up, we saw a lot of people walking, running and biking up. If we were to come back here, I'd definitely try trekking up the hill.When we arrived at the cafe, we noticed many, many people. I mean, this place was packed! There were families, couples and people just walking and jogging all over the place. There are a few main trails to take, so we took the one up to the chalet. It was a short .5mi hike up and only took us about 10 minutes from the cafe. The view from the chalet is just gorgeous. You can see so much of Montreal.

58,"A co-worker, upon hearing that we were going to be in Montreal for a few days, suggested to me that I do  my long run up Mont Royal. Now, when he said ""up Mont Royal"", he neglected to mention that there are two versions of ""up"". He knows me - knows that I always take the stairs. Plus, he's a super smart guy - you'd think that that one tidbit of knowledge about me - stairs taker! - would have clicked into a thought along the lines of, ""She'll probably take the steps up Mont Royal, too...""I had this wonderful plan, which I proposed to my husband on our last full day in Montreal: we'd walk from our hotel (which was on the Rue Saint-Denis) to Mont Royal, spend a bit of time there, throw in a quick run, and then walk from there to La Banquise for a lunch of poutine. He was hesitant, but finally acquiesced. I can be quite convincing.So it was that we left our hotel - me dressed and ready to run, him in his normal clothes and running shoes. It was hot and steamy that morning, and we had nothing to drink on us. The only things I brought were our camera, my sunglasses and a bottle of sunblock. Yes, I can be quite crazy sometimes, too.The walk to the Mont was beautiful, as we passed right by McGill University. The grounds are gorgeous, and everything was so lush and green. We didn't have much time to stop and linger, as it was starting to get even hotter as we walked, and we shared the very real fear that the heat would do me in.We climbed on deceptively steep hill, passing faculty housing, in order to get to the base of Mont Royal. By the time we got to the top, I was sweating profusely and we were both sucking wind. Not willing to give in, we paused at the top (to take pictures, of course!) before we rounded one small bend and tackled the first set of stairs in front of us.I was full of energy and excitement at that point, so I ran up the first flight of steps. Nothin' doin'! My husband caught up to me, warning me to take it easy. I scoffed at him, and turned to tackle the next flight of stairs. Still a piece of cake! I got to the top of that flight, and saw a small incline ahead of me, which I subsequently conquered in record time. It was at that point that I started to feel a bit of the burn. I wasn't about to admit it to my husband, though, as he was still admonishing me for being reckless.Scoffing with much less vigor, I turned around and noticed that in order to get to the next set of stairs, we had to cross a path. I further noticed that people were walking across the path in both directions. Being the dummy that I am, I didn't stop to think what that could possibly mean. No, I was too focused on the next set of stairs to contemplate paths and their eventual meaning!The next flight of stairs...well. They beat me. I'm not too proud to admit it! We had to stop halfway up - for more pictures. It was beautiful up there, but not very restful, as all we heard were the others hiking up the stairs: feet pounding, breath coming in ragged puffs.The final set of stairs were just flat-out rude, but we'd gotten that far, and by this time, it was my hubs who was bound and determined to get to the top. We made it - barely - all the while loudly praying to the hydration gods that there'd be a vendor or a fountain at the top. And do you know, once you best that last flight of steps, you have to climb up a rather steep incline before you get to the terrace?But, the TERRACE! What a view! It's SO worth it (even if you're sticky, sweaty and splotchy, like I was). And yes, they had a glorious drinks vendor, who quickly passed over a couple bottles of Gatorade (bless her).The view, as I mentioned, is breathtaking. You've got a panoramic view of the city in front of you, and the (mostly empty) chalet behind you. There's a small store inside, plus some tables and chairs, and an all-important restroom area.Leaving the terrace and the view behind, if you follow the path out the opposite way, you get to the rest of the park, which we were told was designed by the same guy who helped design Central Park in New York. It's very lush and green, with lots of trails and wildlife (the squirrels are super bold, and we saw one beautiful owl).I left my husband sitting on a bench to do a quick run, and about a mile and half around the mountain, I realized I recognized where I was. I briefly thought I had come full-circle, and that my husband would be around the next bend, but NOPE! I'd run a path that took me back to the last flight of steps! I was staring up at the stairs that nearly broke me, and every fiber in my being was rebelling against the thought of going back up those wooden stairs. So, I turned around and ran right back the way I came from.The trails are well-maintained, and very scenic. They're also well-traveled, so there was always someone for me to wave at or throw a pained smile to (did I mention it was hot and humid that day?)Definitely worth the effort, no matter which way you go!",5,9/13/2015,Jessica S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,"San Diego, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

62,"As a California boy relocating to Montreal, one thing I really missed was the outdoor life: hiking, trees, mountains, nature. And because I have been without car since I've moved here, the only types of nature I can go to have to be public transpo accessible. Enter the lovely Mont Royal, Montreal's Central Park. I've done all kinds of things here. Drove to the viewpoint that overlooks the northern (or is it western?) part of the city. Did the New Years 5k run in the snow. Biked through the cemetery past Beaver Lake up to Mont Royal Chalet. My go-to activity is to get off at Peel Metro, walk up Peel to the base of the mountain and take the stairs up to the Mont Royal Chalet. After resting and enjoying the view, I go back down about halfway and cut a left towards the Rachel Street entrance of the park, hike through some forest, and end up at Jean Mance Park. On a sunny Sunday I might catch the Tam Tam drummers. From there I get on Av du Mont-Royal, picking up a Kouign Amann or a quick espresso from Kahwa Cafe, then catching the Metro back home.

We started our hike at the bottom of the hill, and made the trek high up the very long and what seemed like endless stairs, to a woodsy and picturesque snowy trail path. It was a slow climb up the hill but once we reached the top, a beautiful Chalet with sweeping views of downtown Montréal awaits us. Please be warned! Except for the stairs, the snowy trail path isn't shoveled and some of the terrain can be icy and slippery making it difficult to walk up the hill.

64,"Massive park with lots to see. We went on a 95 degree day so only went to visit the Chalet. We took the Orange line to the Mont Royal station and from there we hopped on the 711 Bus which took us up the mountain. It costs us $3 per adult each way with a free transfer from the train to the bus. We were also told that our 7 year old was free! There are a few stops on the mountain so be sure to check the map to see where you want to be close to. We got off on the stop closest to the Chalet. By the way, there was ample parking there near the Chalet, which we were warned would be pretty filled. I am no sure how much is costs though. Once getting off the bus we walked about 5-10 minutes uphill to the Chalet. The Chalet is beautiful, offering amazing views of the Montreal skyline. There were two ice cream vendors there, who were making a killing on the hot day. There was also a massive Pavilion there which didnt seem to have much but offered shade. Bathrooms maybe?! It was very hot in there (no air conditioning) and smelled pretty bad. Besides offering amazing views, there was also a public piano there, which a few people took it upon themselves to play and entertain the crowd which was definitely a highlight of our visit. After taking a few pics we made our way back down to the Peel Avenue exit. This involved going down lots and lots of stairs. I couldn't imagine going up those stairs on a day as hot as that one. If you plan on going up that way, be prepared by making sure you are healthy and staying hydrated. Also, take your time. Overall we had a great time at this completely free attraction. I would love to return on a cooler day and explore the park some more and also return at night for some amazing nighttime skyline photos.

I think the park can use a few more signs for those not familiar to help us navigate.

68,"I highly recommend going up to Mont Royale if you visit Montreal. You can skate, inner tube, snow shoe, cross country ski, or just plain walk (bring snow pants and waterproof boots). ""Inaugurated in 1876, the Mount Royal Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the highly skilled designer behind New York's Central Park. (His sons helped design Grant Park in Chicago). It is an ideal site for admiring a wide variety of plants and birds or for enjoying outdoor activities. Les amis de la montagne offer a variety of services and activities that provide wonderful opportunities to discover the beauty and wealth of resources that the park has to offer, including the new permanent exhibition at the Maison Smith and interactive terminals and map.  Take Bus 11 up the mountain and get off after at Maison Smith and make your way to the pavillion by the lake. You can rent inner tubes, skates, snowshoes, and I think cross-country skis there.My friend and I rented snowshoes for an hour ($9CAD) and walked around the trail. You can store all your things in a wooden bin (they rent out locks), or if you don't mind lugging your things around, I would suggest using a backpack.  There's a trail that leads to the Chateau, and you'll have an amazing view of Montreal and its surrounding areas. If you get cold, you can go into the Chateau and warm up near the fireplace, or just rest in one of the wooden Adirondack chairs and get a refreshment (hot or cold) from the vending machines.It's really a great place for families and an awesome way to enjoy the great outdoors.* tourisme-montreal.org/Wh…lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/lea…",5,1/30/2017,Katherine L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uPwho6wEsI3b9huaI8y1Iw,"Evanston, IL",Parc du Mont-Royal
69,"What an absolutely stunnnig place to spend a day walking around, experiencing the beauty of a created park and lake right next to an expansive walking trail system overlooking the beautiful city of Montréal. If you don't do anything else, and are on a tight schedule, this is a must do. You can rent bikes if you want to ride around the trails. People walking should be aware that cyclists are on the move. We were lapped a couple times on the trails by a big riding group, who rang a bell upon approach (per Park rules, and common sense). Unlike the solo rider cruising around Lac aux Castors; he didn't announce himself and nearly ended up in the lake for his carelessness when he practically rode into some ladies who didn't hear him. Ample parking at main park (pay at the ticket dispenser) and a smaller lot offside of the road at the summit overlook. Get out at the latter and climb even higher to reach the Mont Royal Cross, which is illuminated at night. Ladies, dressy strappy heels are not recommended on those dirt pathways. Yup, saw it with our own eyes. And please don't feed the wildlife. Recreational smokers tried to look inconspicuous. Something was a giveaway. LOLThe main park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the Connecticut-born landscape architect and anti-slavery activist, who also designed New York's Central Park. Lac aux Castors was the creation of Frederick Gage Todd, originally from Concord, NH and did his apprenticeship in landscape architecture with Olmsted's firm. There is currently an informative exposition, ""Mont Royal: A Territory to Discover"" in Maison Smith, a 19th century farmhouse. We didn't check out the Maison Smith café. Upper level can be rented out for meeting space. Year-round activities abound in the park for individuals, kids, families and groups (lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act…).

I decided on stopping by here first. Navigation sent me up the hill into a pay lot. After paying the parking, I was directed to the scenic overlook by friendly locals. A quick five minute walk led me to an overlook that portrayed the Montreal skyline beautifully. The view was spectacular (check pics). There is also a building which I assume can be used as a party hall. And who wouldn't want to have a party with such a view in the distance?The rest of the park includes trails leading in and out of the heavily wooded area.

73,"My very first stop in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, invited for a hike with friends to the gazebo (or what do you call the sightseeing paid-binocular-zoom tour area where we all take selfies) at the top. I had only been there about 12 hours and our first trip was to the famed  ""The Mountain"" like other University students (well I did not enroll yet, that came second).Like Lexington Market (from the state Maryland I was born), just the stores do not sell beautiful, exquisite, intricately designed knives, for style, at every store, instead they've installed trees (the green kind with leaves) versus Lexington Market removed all signs of nature, for style.Same in terms of 420 smoking at any hour night or day somebody has a lighter you can hear, literally hear. Either that or you will hear unequivocal coughing. Be prepared to be offered and propositioned to smoke, exactly like Lexington Market again. So just say no if you need to if you're encountering that, they're used to the certain majority of people who say yes actually.I think a good/fair comparison between Lexington Market and The Mountain is to be made just in terms of: (a) seating made for humans and (b) actual organic nature (to avoid mentioning (c) the store comparisons where only there has weapons, while both have equal hospitals, only there has knives at all stores at the front for quick buying). Montreal Quebec believes it has people there, Baltimore Maryland did not codify that yet.Otherwise has same share of people who are broke and not broke just very amazingly quizical and puzzling difference from how people are treated by default. (Default is a computer word, many people bring their computers to study at The Mountain, versus in Lexington Market you might get told by a security guard to move because you look too good, at The Mountain the police sit the same style as people around during en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta… Tam Tams).",5,10/25/2018,Prosody--Gabriel C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TGeQV83Uo4VFEzPuxJ_Uaw,"Baltimore, MD",Parc du Mont-Royal

76,"As a New Yorker, no walk is too long, and no hike is too high and Mont-Royal was a wonderful day trip to the top. We did not take the marked trail or the path of steps which most people tend to take. Although we did take an off-beaten path (and cough, maybe hopped an illegal fence or two), it was beautifully serene and is a wilderness escape in the middle of the bustling city. I cannot say enough great things about this park, there are many great things to discover, and greenery to immerse oneself in. This park was probably one of my favorite part about Montreal, so if you are an out-of-towner, DON'T MISS IT! I believe there are buses you can take up to the Chateau and you can rent bikes as well, or if you're a little adventurous like us, take the hike up or the off-the-beaten path (I shouldn't condone illegal fences, my bad).  The best part: DON'T MISS THE VIEW FROM THE CHATEAU!A few cons: 1. Very little/no English signage, not all of us know French, especially since it is such a tourist attraction.2. Limited drinks & food at the top, only vending machines.3. Bugs/mosquitoes galore. BRING REPELLANT. I walked away with approx. 37 bug bites, not exaggerating. Remember: To bring snacks (unless you want to get skinny on your hike)To bring drinks/water (unless you are a human cactus)To bring your sneakers (unless you can hike in flip-flops like me)To bring bug spray (unless you want to get eaten alive)To bring a camera (amazing views galore)",5,7/14/2014,Priyanka R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ub1AgBJRK71EZU14f4AaBQ,"Chicago, IL",Parc du Mont-Royal

I think the best time to visit this place is the fall because the trees will be different colors and it will really make the city view beautiful! The small hike up also would not be that slippery from ice/snow. Parking was not bad at all. It was definitely full but you can get parking if you wait a couple minutes.

86,"Very easy to get to with nice views of the city. There are a few ways to get there -- if you have your own car you can drive to the parking lot that is on Chemin Remembrance. You could be adventurous and bike up this same road to the top but that is a major climb. You can also hike fairly easily to the top -- we went through the Cemetery from the North Entrance as we were staying behind Mont Royal in Outremont. The initial part of this path was a bit steep but nothing too intense for an average person. For some reason I kind of expected a grassy area where you could relax and even have a picnic if you wanted at the top but it is not like that at all. There is a strange cottage building (the Chalet) that looks like a train station inside but had nothing except access to bathrooms and a small gift shop (with some cool shirts actually). Otherwise it is just a bunch of different walking trails and then the main attraction is the big open square area for viewing the city with some steps that you can sit on. Make sure you get to the chalet though! There is a small stop area off the road that has views of the city before you walk to the top and I wonder if some people think that is THE view -- it is not. You can also continue walking further up to the cross (Croix) but don't expect much when you get there.Anyway, overall it's a must-see in Montreal in my opinion but also a nice way to start your morning with some activity!",5,5/22/2016,Neechi M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jyGzKoSIs-AStRX3NItM0Q,"Oakland, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

Does have history so read up if your into it:)!Mount Royal is a mid size volcanic hill adjacent to downtown Montreal. We decided to walk from St Laurent street post lunch from Swartz. Many ways to get there. Our ""trusty"" Map-quest took us via Pin- Street. We ended up on the Stadium side of McGill university. People were friendly along the way leading us to our destination. Option 1: Scenic Route windy paved road for a ""casual"" to ""running path up the hill/mountain - vast trees - small creek- some wildlife ? (We saw a huge raccoon, squirrels and a gofer :). Can take a bike up- be prepared to trek up hill.Option 2: stairs - from intersection Pins/Peel. Goes right up to the View Point. Watch out for those avid fitness junkies ( all positive) that are running up and down pass you.Option 3: Bus 80 or I believe there's an express.Option 4: taxi- expensive but good choice if raining or snowing :).Option 5: unbeaten / unpaved path through the trees. Any way up will also take you back down!Also people are so friendly - all local. I am sure they were thinking why is this one attempting this with a cane! Doable ! Attire: we dressed casually as did the locals. Some wearing flip flops! Be prepared though- it's not a stroll unless u make it one. Benches along the way. Take water and do take some snacks. The beaver ""lake"" small quaint resting spot with man made pool. The Chateau at the top- nice architecture but just a space to rest - mostly everyone is outdoors enjoying the view - taking pics and listening to music. There's a few Popsicle vendors and unfortunately NO cafe - just vending machines. So decided if you want to eat prior it take snacks with you. During winter/early spring when raining or snowing - it wasn't this lively and we got taken to an adjacent smaller view point.

Stroller and powerchair friendly with a slight incline. After we took in the view of downtown Montreal and glimpsed inside the chalet, we rounded a 2-ish km pathway. The easy uphill walk featured the croix du mont royal (cross) and ended at a large antennae (very anticlimatic), before we went back to the the chalet.MAISON SMITHBack around where we parked, we went inside Maison Smith to use their restrooms (located in a cool cavernous basement), checked out their informative exhibits about the park, and munched on some lunch in their cafe.LE STADE SCENIC OVERLOOKOn our way out on Camillien-Houde, we stopped for a few minutes at the parking friendly overlook of Le Stade Olympique.Signage was minimal and rather poor, which is why I recommend researching ahead of time so you're not wandering aimlessly around secondary trails. If you like hanging out in cemeteries (you creepster), we passed by two on our way out. The ony thing I regret is not having enough time to make the trek to Lac au Castors (a reclaimed bog/large picturesque pond with water activities).",4,7/12/2015,Jenny H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1LdXqpTv0bcKQVkQB6Lttg,"San Francisco, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

We walked up Peele Street next to McGill's campus until we arrived at the bottom of the mountain and then made our way up. I would suggest wearing sneakers and workout gear for this hike; you'll work up a sweat climbing the 400 steps of a continuous staircase before arriving at the Chalet. If you have the energy and are able to hike some more you can continue on a dirt path to the right and hike a few paths around in a circle, making your way up to the Cross. After your hiking adventure you can head back down to the Chalet and relax, enjoying the view of the city. There is a bus that can take you up and down as well.

This bus will go up the mountain saving you a very long walk up unless you plan on biking up there. You can still walk around the many trails once you get off the bus stop there that's near a very large parking area. You can head up a trail that will take you to the top of the peak where you will get a very nice panoramic view of Montreal. Walking up and looking around will be less than an hour unless you want to spend more time around the trails. I didn't have that luxury so we just did this part and left even though there was lots more to see.Then once you're done the walk take the bus 11 back down the mountain to St. Laurent Blvd. Get off at that street and walk to 3895 St. Laurent Blvd to Schwartz's for short wait and a great Montreal smoked meat sandwich.

It is about a 5 km walk up till you reach the stairs. The view from the top is amazing - you can see all of the city. All the buildings, all areas, the river. Definitely worth it! Go there on a sunny day, on a snowy day, at sunset or sunrise - every single view is amazing. When you live in Montreal you have to see the mountain in all types of weathers - in sun, snow, fall, spring, colors, rain - every setting is beautiful in its own way.

151,"Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park and Prospect Park. He also designed Grand Army Plaza, Fort Tryon, Morningside Park, Eastern Parkway... (heck, he coined the word ""parkway""!) So it was interesting to see an aesthetic I'd considered so ""New York"" pop up on my recent visit to Montreal.Montreal's namesake park is, like all the Olmsted creations I've had the pleasure of experiencing, a peaceful expanse that comes with the profound feeling that you're smack in the middle of a bustling city, but at the same time cleanly sealed off from it.  The park is basically a giant hill filled with gorgeous trees. It's a lot more interesting than any ol' tourist park, because it's an adventure in itself! You have to climb up a zigzag of stairs and mazes of roads and foresty paths to explore it (yay goal-oriented behavior).Hiking up to Mont Royal's entrance on Rue Peel sucks. It's like a 40 degree incline; don't know how the McGill kids stand it. But once you enter the park, that peaceful feeling settles in. The stairs are staggered so it doesn't feel too bad.Reserve 2-3 hours of your day to visit Mont Royal. All the signs on paths inside are useless, so leave yourself some time to get lost. If you're visiting during daytime, the autumn leaves are BEAUTIFUL. If you're visiting close to evening - bring flashlights! There are barely any lights the higher up you go, and absolute darkness follows soon after dusk. We saw several intrepid Montrealers wearing headlights. Note that there isn't anything on the ""summit"" proper - you'll catch several lovely views of Montreal going up, but on the true summit there's nothing but a radio tower, plus a crown of trees obstructing any view outward.For some reason, just below the summit, there's a gigantic lit-up Broadway-esque Christian cross, straight out of a sci-fi-horror film.

152,"I saw a large hill and wanted to climb it. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. I saw a group of Canadian guys who dressed with urban fashion sense. They were the closest to me, so I walked up to ask directions to the top of the hill. As I approached the group and made eye contact with the assumed ring leader or head dealer in charge, I made eye contact. He tossed a lighter at me and it landed by my feet. I made a straight line toward him and asked what he was trying to prove. To quote Mobb Deep, he was a shook one. There was one of me and around 4 of them. Odds were against me although I would have put a hurting on at least one of them which would have been more than worth the ass whooping. He figured that I was not concerned with his minor act of intimidation. He tried to speak French. I explained that I am from America and don't speak that language. He goes ""You want weed?"" and I told him I don't need his bogus herb, just directions. He provided them.

The view at the top/the chateau is quite nice and you can go inside to rest and warm up.

155,"Mount Royal was definitely a highlight of my trip to Montreal. It was a relatively easy bike ride from our hotel, and we had no issues finding it. It's a beautiful park, with many trails, open spaces for a nap/picnic, and of course, that amazing view once you reach the top. We opted to take the stairs, but I believe there is at least one other path that will get you there. Now let me warn you, those steps are no joke. NO JOKE. It was the middle of August when we visited, and by the time we made it to the top, I was drenched it sweat. My footwear was also wildly inappropriate for such a hike (I had on Chuck Taylors), and a good running or hiking sneaker would've made the journey much more comfortable, I'm sure. The terrace allows for sweeping, panoramic views of the entire city. It was really beautiful, and made our trek more than worth it. There is a visitor's center where you can sit down for a rest, use the facilities, etc. No air conditioning when we went, so it was still sticky inside. There are also vendors selling drinks and ice cream if you need to replenish your energy stores before the much easier walk down the hill.Mont Royal was recommended as a ""must see"" while in Montreal, and after experiencing it, I would agree.

We went up at dusk using the stairs and pathways that cut up the 'mountain'. This took less than 15min. I was able to do it even though I use a cane and am tired at the end of the day.We would highly recommend taking a flashlight with you for your way in the dark - most hotels will lend one out to you if your cell phone light is insufficient.When we got up to the top we saw many people there, some of whom had driven to same lookout view at the top.There were people there even very late at night so my friend and I (both women) thought it was very safe.I regret that we didn't skip one of the other sights to walk it during the daytime or at sun rise/set when we could see the trees in all their glory.",4,1/1/2016,Geeta S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ykcYfhzoSEAwrjoMr5hctQ,"San Francisco, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

164,Ok so no one tells you that it is a very tiresome hike up those stairs. It's about 30+ flights up. From downtown area I was able to walk up a hill about ten mins to the park entrance. Then it was about another 25 min walk up the stairs. I had no idea or would have worn sneakers and light clothing bc you do get tired and hot very fast. I took multiple breaks on those stairs! However when you get to the top the view is well worth it. There is a terrace area that has gorgeous views of the city. There's also some seating and greenery so you can sit down and people watch. Inside the little house thingy there are bathrooms and souvenir shops. There is a small shop that sells very good lemonade. I wanted water but they don't sell it and the vending machine would've cost me 4$ for a small bottle so I got some lemonades instead for 2$ and it was well worth it. Also I wish they had more signage with where to go. There were no signs until about halfway up the stairs. Luckily I followed some other tourists bc my internet also went out in this area and was ableTo walk in the right direction. Overall a very nice place to spend the afternoon.

171,"Montrealers are very proud of the fact that their major city park, Mont-Royal, was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the mastermind behind NYC's Central Park. But note that the Canadian park came nearly 25 years later; I'm pretty sure that between those two major commissions, Olmstead had a stroke and forgot everything he knew about park design. If you're used to the whimsies and surprises of Central Park - ponds, glades, fields, forests, fountains, ornamental bridges, and stone-lined footpaths - you'd never recognize the same hand at work here. Instead, Mont-Royal is mainly a series of semi-paved tracks through the woods, with little thought for vistas or variety. If you're a local, this makes for excellent jogging or cross-country skiing (and there are plenty of buff bodies along the trails to prove it). But for tourists on a time budget, the only real reason to climb the ""mountain"" is the excellent view from the broad terrace of Chalet du Mont-Royal.

Upon telling our family that we were going we received advice on which sights were must sees and which could be avoided. This was on the must see list.    After walking around the city and meeting some awesome locals we ended up staying up all night drinking in our rental. Our newly made pal left around sunrise and my hubs and I weren't quite ready to hit the hay, so we grabbed a bagel from the shop down the block to help sober us up. After our bagel we decided to talk a walk to the park. Camera in hand we set off. We walked from our rental stopping for another cup of coffee on the way.     We got to the park and expected it to be a breeze to get to the top. I could not have been more wrong, especially after drinking all night. Anyhow, we hiked to the top, and let me tell you it was totally worth the trek. I did get a lot of interesting looks going up the mountain in jeans, with my camera and a cup of coffee.    Once at the top, we were rewarded with sweeping views of the city. This is the perfect place to capture some of the best panoramas of the city below.

Someone was extremely nice and gave us their parking pass. This started out our time at Mount Royal on a great note. We walked for about an hour in the area that has a pretty little lake.

180,"Mont-Royal park is one of my happy places. Rain or shine, hot and muggy weather or below zero temps, you'll find me going for a walk on the mountain. Out of town visitors will ask what the draw is .... it is the mountain itself. No gimmicks, just lots of nature, a few lookouts and Beaver lake. Us Montrealers are extremely lucky to have such a large green space in the middle of the city, ""the lungs of the city"" as Olmsted referred to his parks. My favourite thing to do is put on sturdy hiking shoes, fill up my water bottle and grab a snack, and head out on a couple of hours of wandering. I much prefer the smaller paths to the main Olmsted Road, wiggling my way across the mountain, occasionally popping out in more populated areas like the belvedere and Beaver lake.  The views are beautiful, and I get a thrill finding my apartment nestled in amongst the other buildings.In the winter the smaller paths can be quite treacherous, but the larger ones remain quite nice thanks to the many people who walk, run, job and bike them year round, plus all of those who cross-country ski and snowshoe.  The refrigerated rink at Beaver Lake is great, as it doesn't matter what the weather is like, the ice is always nice.",5,10/16/2013,Amanda C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
181,"This park is huge -- it's Montréal's equivalent of Central Park in NYC or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.  There are massive open spaces and wide, groomed-dirt trails for people to walk, bike, or jog.  If you take the trails all the way up to the top, there's a huge empty building that looks like it could host giant receptions and galas, with a large patio with a great view of the city.There's a giant pond with paddleboats in the summer, and ice skating in the winter!  Plenty of picnic areas, too.  It's definitely a great spot to check out if you are in Montréal.  Especially since the park is FREE!  (parking costs money, though).OHMIGOD - I just realized that the entire city of Montréal is named after this place!!",5,8/26/2011,Chris Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QKhJkTpDuwnR6TozGT1eqg,"Newark, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
182,"I was pretty much told that we were going to Parc du Mont-Royal by my boyfriend while we were in Montreal. I had no desire to go since I thought it was just a hill.Driving up to the park, it was pretty scenic with trees, bicyclists just everywhere. More than half way up, there was an overlook where you can see the buildings of downtown Montreal. I thought it was so neat I wanted to stop and take a look, but we kept driving up even further.Holy. Cow. The view left me breathless. So amazing seeing the whole city from this one point.  I am so glad I was able to experience this on my trip to Montreal.Very neat place. Can be very romantic if there weren't many people around. There was a visitor who was playing this random piano that was just placed there.",5,9/6/2013,Bunny P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EA8GylDs_8kpvbkrRppcgQ,"Orlando, FL",Parc du Mont-Royal
183,"Wonderful!  So refreshing to get out & into nature in the middle of the city.  We loved the walk on the trails and barely saw any other people--so quiet & peaceful.  Our kids' feet got chilly, so it was nice to warm up by the fire at the chalet.  This nice public space was also a good place to use the restrooms and take photos of both the building and the view.  Their gift shop was straightforward and very well-curated.I'd love to explore this area more in the summer; it's probably so pretty.",5,4/13/2015,Danielle B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o1-Flue1EoUvRsOR9cDRsA,"Medford Lakes, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal

185,"Pros: View of Montreal and outskirts, nice park before getting to look offCons: Paying for parkingSeeing this was our first trip to Montreal we decided to see it all from a distance. If you're looking at getting a birds eye view of downtown Montreal (for free/cheap) this is the way to do it. There is a lot of parking, however be prepared to dish out a few bucks for it. There are several pay stations where you pay for a certain amount of time and put the receipt on your dash.You first come to the park. There seem to be an assortment of trails you can take, although we hardly explored any. There are several sculptures and pond in the park, in addition to a lodge style building - it was closed since we arrived early in the morning, so I'm not sure its function.There were signs to lead you to the view point, but we didn't see anything that directed us from the parking lot, so keep that in mind - you may need to walk around a bit if you're unfamiliar with the park layout. Once you get to the top you will be pleased with the view. Its an incredible sight to see all of Montreal from one spot. You can see the entire city, the river and a few smaller mountains in the background (looking towards Vermont). I would say this is a great spot to visit when going to Montreal. I gave it a ""average score"" because it was just that. It wasn't terrible - I would say still visit, but don't plan to be ""wow'd"" by any means.",3,8/14/2014,Josh B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pnr3WpOif1r75BN5xept3A,"Halifax, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
186,"Absolutely awesome!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they could use some food and beverage vendors at the chalets and, also, they could use a pay app that had gps for all of there different trails. Tourists for sure would purchase since we, and others we encountered, were lost and google maps didn't help. If you knew where you were going and you could track your distance (for training purposes) this park would be better than central park, NY. It definitely has the potential; I hope the next time we visit there are improvements.

187,The place is nice. We went during the winter so it was underwhelming and not paved at all (must bring snow shows) but once you get to the top the view is very nice and the satisfaction of having climbed the mountain is wonderful. Don't expect a paved and nice easy walk if it's winter/snow is outside. Im not complaining though I liked the rugged trip.

188,"How can anybody give this gorgeous urban oasis, the Grand Dame of Montreal, less than a 5-star rating???? It's incomprehensible to me!!!As a kids, my grandparents came to this park, centrally located in the heart of the city, yet feeling worlds away from the hustle and bustle of city life. My father grew up near here and visited the mountain here a gazillion times. As a child, I was taken here every winter to skate on Beaver Lake (which was iced over each winter) and us kids tobogganed down the gentle slopes by the Lac des Castors, stopping only for hot cocoa we got in the adjacent chalet. As a teenager and young adult, I spent whole summers here, suntanning on the slopes with my friends, having picnics, playing our guitars, tossing frisbee and listening to the radio (yes, we were frustrated hippies! Lol). The hilly slopes were packed with fellow sunbathers and families and couples, just relaxing and taking in the warm weather and the gorgeous surrounding greenery. I hear the mountain is still bustling in the summer!The lower mountain contains Beaver Lake, the large chalet and miles and miles of pathways and trails, paved and not, big and small. There are a gazillion squirrels and ducks (and there used to be swans, too, but I haven't seen them the last few times I visited). There's a playground/park area off the lake that has been renovated and updated sometime in the past 5 years or so. It's amazing! There are 2 climbing rocks and a small ground-mounted water feature and lots of contemporary play equipment. Even my two teen kids loved these new playground features! And I loved seeing all the young tots and families laughing and playing; there were French and English families, orthodox Jewish families, and I heard other languages spoken that I could not place. It was great. Everything a city park should be.The upper mountain (which is connected to the lower mountain by way of a gazillion paths and trails) is comprised of a grand stone chalet (I think it's called the Smith House) and the most popular lookout of the entire city, with a vista of McGill and the downtown skyline. You know the photo of downtown Montreal you see on 90% of postcards? That's taken at this observation lookout. It's a spectacular view, day or night. Further up the mountain, on trails and paths, big and small, are a tall,  on-descript radio or cell tower, a radio CBC building, and then the piece du resistance, the glorious cross of Montreal (croix de Mont Royal). I laughed when I read the reviewer say that the cross was creepy and she didn't know why it was there. In 1643, the founder of Montreal, de Maisonneuve, erected the first cross on this site. As long as I can remember, and as long as my father can remember, there's always been a cross here on the mountain, which is illuminated each night. I remember studying late in the McGill library in the early 80's and seeing the cross light up at night. It's not creepy; it's an integral part of the City's history.Anyhow, Mont Royal is a glorious oasis. It's beloved by bikers, jogger's, strollers, dog walkers (man, I used to walk my dog Maggie here a lot in the 90s! She adored  exploring all the narrow trails through the woods), families and ALL Montrealers. Interns and doctors on break come here from the Montreal General for a brief respite, to de-stress. Mommy groups come here. Couples snuggle on benches. The young and old come here. This is our Central Park - and, I know I'm biased, but I prefer it to Central Park, as the views of the city cannot be beat. And it's safe. And clean.  The mountain is stunning in fall, with the explosion of colors in the foliage. It's serenely beautiful in the winter with the glistening snow and ice-crystalled trees. It's fresh and crisp in the spring with the scents of grass and the colors of flowers emerging. And the greenery of summer and the warmth of the air is wonderful. My only gripe is the parking. It used to be free. Now they've revamped the lots, so there seems to be way more parking spots (always a good thing!), but it costs so much to park ($3/hour), even when the park is near empty on cool and rainy days. I remember spending whole days here, with my pals in the summer, and it cost nothing. I think the park was more frequented and enjoyed then.",5,8/16/2013,Nancy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,"Vancouver, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
189,My wife and I and two friends drove up to Montreal for a quick 3 day vacation before moving onto Quebec City. We stayed at an Airbnb place near Mount Royal so we had to check it out.

192,I have been coming here my whole life and absolutely love this place.  I think the lookout is one of my favourite spots in Montreal with its views of the downtown skyline.  On a beautiful day it is a great spot to enjoy a picnic or go for a run.  Even in winter it is worth coming to if you like skating or cross country skiing.,5,9/8/2013,Julia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
193,"If you want the easiest way to get up Mont Royal, get on Peel Street. There's a LOT of stairs to the top. There's several walking paths in which people are usually exercising. There's some statues on the ground level. Once you get to the top, there is an ice pop cart off to the right(I think). There's a large area where you can take pictures, but the only place you can sit outside is right in front of the building, and if it's sunny, the sun will definitely be on you. Inside, there are interesting squirrels in the eaves. There is a gift shop and some seating. There's a vending machine, but if you want plain water, you have to go downstairs, where there are restrooms. It's generally creepy in the basement, though.

195,"In case you're feeling a little adventurous, I just want to mention something that may not have been mentioned in previous reviews. Once you reach the Chalet du Mont Royal with the large circular viewing area where all the tourists linger around and take photos, that's not the highest you can go. If you're facing the Chalet, keep walking behind it up some stairs and you'll see a park. Instead of going around the park along the paved road, cut straight to back of the park and you'll see some unpaved entry way into what looks like a hiking trail. Keep walking and you'll find yourself in a forest. I stumbled upon it by accident because I didn't want to walk along the pavement and was so glad I did. The locals must all know about it because I saw a couple of people jogging in there with their dogs, but it's a heavenly area to be in if you want to take the road less taken. See pic: yelp.ca/biz_photos/BYnmP….Once you enter the trail, it'll take you only 15-20 minutes to get to the top. You also have several chances to cut out of the trail and return to the paved road if you want. I may be wrong but once I reached the top, there was no view, but the trail itself is worth checking out.",5,9/18/2011,Cathy Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0TEhMp517b3hO54B3yor9A,"Portland, OR",Parc du Mont-Royal

Mont-Royal has one of the best running paths I've ever been on, and you'll see your fair share of runners on any given day. If for whatever reason you can't hike or run up, there's also a road (and bus) in the back that you can use to drive up to the vista points. If you're lucky enough to be in Montreal throughout the seasons, you'll be able to catch the astonishing annual lifecycle of the mountain from here - from the budding greens of spring, to the overflowing life in summer, to the fiery leafs of fall, to the snowy calm of winter.

The terrain is gravel and it's quite shady. The way to the top is by long switchbacks up the mountain and then a long set of stairs to the top. Once you reach the top, you're rewarded with a view of Montreal (on a clear day) and there's plenty of steps and chairs to sit and rest.For our way down, we saw a short cut which basically when straight down the mountain via steps.

Except for the red ""s"" that is so prominent from almost every viewpoint (see pics). Really though, it's a winter wonderland.Super fun to slip and slide down the closed staircases. I'm pretty sure the whole park would be closed in the US for fear of crazy lawsuits. Props to Canada for keeping it open and trusting people to use decent judgment.

218,"Mont royal is a lovely park right in the middle of Montreal.  My boyfriend and I went in early July and the weather was perfect.   When you're at the top, you can see the whole city.  But the good part (for me) was the walking up to the top - not so much the view!  Before we went, we read a lot of reviews about the hike and how it would take hours to walk it, that  the stairs are horrible and to take the bus etc.  After having done it, I can honestly say that IT""S NOT THAT BAD!  We started at Stanley Ave (I think - one of the streets by McGill) and Pine.  We walked along the path and looped it up.  We weren't walking fast and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the summit.  We're also not speed walkers or in great shape.  It was just a leisurely pace. We took the stairs down and once we realized how short they were, we actually went back up on the stairs!  It took like 10 minutes and that was just going an average pace!  Seriously - THE STAIRS ARE NOT THAT BAD!!!Hope this helps to put others at ease!  Wendy",4,8/21/2012,Wendy Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ALY9ndNxWej1m21X6TuPvg,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal

I went back a couple days later and hiked up on my own! I went via Station Mont Royal - stopping off at the cute boutiques/coffee shops along Avenue du Mont Royal. That area is definitely a lot more rustic and interesting compared to downtown. It was soooo beautiful - very easy road/track to walk up - with more challenging vertical climbs if you wish to do so - and as I was there in Autumn, the beautiful colors of the leaves accompanied you the whole way, until you get to the top and see the stunning view overlooking Montreal! Things are clearly signposted and its worth checking out the Chateaux - where the old groundskeeper used to live - and in the basement (where the free toilets are!) is an interesting display of the history etc of the area. Didn't have any food at the Chateaux, but there were plenty of people eating and enjoying a hot drink. The walk down via the steps back into downtown is a nice way to take a look through McGill University too.

240,"A hike up to the top of Mont Royal is an experience not to be missed if you're ever in Montreal.  It doesn't take too long, but I would recommend leaving enough time to take a stroll around and take in the beautiful scenery.  I was able to climb up the stairs (this is the shortcut) in about an hour - starting from the bottom of the street (corner of Peel and Maisonneuve).  I stopped a lot along the way, as I wasn't feeling too well that day, so it's probably hike-able in less than an hour if you're full of energy that day. :)  The final 100 steps or so are quite steep and nearly a vertical trek up, so it's something to keep in mind.If you choose to take the leisurely route and stop through other historical spots, it is supposed to take about three hours.  It's also allegedly a lot less steep, as the incline is gradual.  I highly recommend checking out Frommers' ""Walking Tour 3 or 4"", which is a detailed self-guided tour through and up Mont Royal.Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll be at the Chalet du Mont Royal.  It's a breathtaking view of the entire city, and I was lucky to be there on a sunny, but cool day.  Even though it was the tail end of summer, the late afternoon breeze up there was quite chilly for an LA native such as myself!  You can continue past the Chalet, through a gravel-ish road that will lead you to the Croix (the cross atop the mountain).  It takes about 10-15 minutes to get there from the Chalet, but it's a lovely walk through a visual of greenery that is so worth it.  Location is easy to get to, as the uphill trek starts in downtown area (very close to McGill University and the Peel or McGill metro stops).  Do it!",5,9/29/2011,Sara R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,"Dallas, TX",Parc du Mont-Royal

It involved a lot of walking uphill, walking over some tiny streams (that were still running), walking up some steep rocky bits and some flights of stairs, slipping sometimes, but it was worth it. The view from the top is incredible, you can see much of the city. I went during the nighttime, so I could see all the buildings lit up and could point out some landmarks, such as te Olympic Stadium. The way up may have been more difficult, but the walk back down proved to be much easier. I returned again this spring, and it was a much different experience. It was raining and foggy, but wasn't too chilly or anything. My group took a different route this time. In the winter we had walked up some roads, but this time all we did was take some stairs to walk up (which were the same stairs I took on the way back down during my trek in the winter). Walking up the stairs was lengthy, but again well worth it. Because it was foggy you couldn't see too much of the city, but it was beautiful seeing the rain fall from that high up.If you love nature like myself, it's a pretty amazing hike to take, being surrounded by the trees.

You can take the stairs up as well, which happened to be opened even during the winter season.  There was a building there beside Beaver Lake where you can rent skis & skates for a small price. Beaver Lake was frozen and many people were ice-skating on it. Kids were enjoying their time tobogganing and many others were having a great time skiing.Up on the mountain, there is a boutique and small cafe in the Smith House. The boutique was nothing special; it was like a store you would find at the zoo. Also, on the top of the mountain you have a breathtaking view of the city below- worth seeing!",5,1/26/2011,Masha B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sMhvlIPGLUlRA7QsWlqBOg,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
262,"I have such great memories from this park.  I spent a good part of my youth in Montreal and sadly do not live there now, but try to get up there as often as possible.  My grandparents took me there tobogganing, I went there with friends to hang out and explore.  It is a magical part of Montreal -- from its peak to its base.This is such a wonderful -- and huge (101 hectare or nearly 250 acres) -- park with so much to see and do.  Everything from hiking, biking, skating, skiing, etc.  I have climbed up the mountain and walked all along its trails and never get bored of it.And don't forget about the views from the parking area at the top of the peak -- the BEST views of this wonderful city are here night and day.  You can also start a small hike from here to the lighted cross at the top of the moutain.Oh . . . and for those of you with religous or historical curiousity, there is also the 100+ year old St. Joseph's Oratory where supposedly 1,000's were healed there throughout the years.  There are thousands on crutches on display which are supposed to have come from those who were healed there.  Very moving place to visit -- even if you are not Catholic.  (and shhhhh . . . don't tell anyone, but my cousin and I used to shoot off caps from the top balcony overlooking the parking area.)  And it is gorgeous to look at in the evening when it is all lit up -- I used to love standing in our living room window before going to bed and seeing that lovely church all lit up -- especially in the winter time.To sum it up, there is SO much to do in this oasis of a park which is in the heart of the city.  Montreal would not be the city that is without the beauty of this park.  So no matter what time of year you are there visiting -- or if you are lucky enough to be living there -- don't overlook Mount Royal, as there is something to see and do everywhere you turn.  Or if you don't want to do anything at all, there is so much open space to just sit and relax.There is always something going on there -- much like Central Park in NY -- to check out the happenings at Mount Royal, check them here: lemontroyal.qc.ca/index2…",5,8/8/2008,Jeffrey K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jbOVoVtVXIqnhE_cp-yMnA,"Rockville Centre, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal

264,"Walking up to the lookout point near the top of Mont Royal was a highlight of our trip to Montreal. The park itself is gorgeous, and was designed by Frederick Olmstead, who also designed NYC's Central Park. In September, it was lush, verdant and filled with just enough people to remind us that we weren't in the middle of the forest -- although we did spot a raccoon hiding in a little hole in the top of a tree!After walking on the path for a few miles (oops, kilometers) and noticing we were slowly gaining altitude, we took a staircase up (maybe the equivalent of 5 minutes on a StairMaster) and emerged at the Kondiaronk Belvedere (what a badass name), a lookout point -- not the tippy top of the ""mountain"" but definitely near the summit. From there, we had a great vantage point to take in the whole city, especially the skyline. Fortunately, there was also a chalet open to the public with nice, clean restrooms. It was only a short walk from the chalet to the Smith House, which sells gifts, and more importantly, sorbet.Once we made it back down the stairs and down the hill, we emerged back into the city at the doorstep of the McGill campus, enabling us for more urban exploration (i.e. a lot more walking).",5,10/15/2011,Colleen R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iNV_dTKaxit6ZkvbRfERdQ,"New Orleans, LA",Parc du Mont-Royal
265,"I went to Montreal over a year before writing this for a week long birthday vacation with my boyfriend. Growing up in the Midwest, United States, I spent most of my life deprived of mountainous regions. Before we even arrived to the city, I was determined to climb my first mountain - Mont Royal. After experiencing a few days of the city, we made the venture from our hotel in Longueuil to the park (after a brief stop for meat pies at Tourtiere Australienne! YUM!!). Never one to follow conventional wisdom, (or previously marked trails, for that matter) I - the trail guide for the day - decided to bush-wack our way up the side of the mountain. About half-way up, without a trail in sight, we realize that we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a situation. Above us was steep, crumbly dirt that was still wet from the rain from the last couple days. Below us was a slightly less steep drop, but jagged rocks, broken glass bottles, the few trees we'd been using to pull ourselves up, and just as much crumbly ground. With no choice at that point but to continue on, we scaled the side of the mountain by digging into the dirt until we finally found a path to continue on to. From the grounds around Chalet du Mont-Royal, you can see the whole city spread out in all of it's glory below you. We arrived just before dusk, so we had the immediate transition from the sunny scenery, to the rosy glow lending its light to the vista below.  We found our way in the quickly departing light to the Croix du Mont-Royal - the peak of the mountain, and while I was busy taking pictures of the cross at night, my boyfriend was rummaging through his bag. I turned around to see what he thought of the view as he was getting down on his knee with a small box in his hand. He asked if I would climb more mountains with him, then he asked me to marry him!  The Parc du Mont-Royal, and its namesake mountain will always hold a special place in my heart, but even if you don't have the same sentimental experience, it's still a great place to see!",5,9/11/2011,Amber D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1tntwPMN42Dx3q_Rpx6vLg,"Wellesley, MA",Parc du Mont-Royal

So many picnics there, so many days lying around eating baguettes and cheese during Tams.

277,"My friend and I took a nice hike up to the lookout in Parc du Mont Royal.  It was a bit confusing because we didn't exactly know where we were going, but we asked for directions and figured it out.  If you start from the main entrance on the east side of the park, you walk up to the main road, take a left onto the road, and follow it up.  There were a lot of shortcuts over the switchbacks but I didn't really want to get lost, so I didn't take any of them.As people have mentioned, the main entrance was filled with drummers (?).  Everyone tries to be hip in Montreal.  The lookout area was nice and there's a building up there and some plaques pointing out the various sights of Montreal.  There's also higher ground at the real summit, but we didn't have time to go there.  On our way back to the main entrance, we encountered a bunch of people dressed in medieval gear, battling each other.  It was pretty cool.  They divided up into two groups.  Someone signaled the beginning of the battle and they charged each other with padded swords and shields.  Typical rules: if you're hit on the arm or leg, it's disabled.  Everyone keeps fighting until one army is completely disabled.  There were some archers, too, but foam tipped arrows didn't seem very effective as they didn't fly far or straight.  I thought it was funny how the 10 year old kids hung at the back of the army and tried to rush in for a few quick flurries.",4,6/10/2009,Terri Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WqeK9gyjDXL_7G3RjIUGHQ,"Los Altos, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

We took the windy path to the top and skipped the stairs, taking one short cut at one point and beat several pairs we saw along the windy path. However, once we got to the top, we turned, and all we could see were trees and a parking lot. We headed west, and found three paths and a large lake, but never figured out how to get to ""the top"" for the views of the city skyline. Perhaps one should find a map so one know which trails to go. The few signs we saw were all in French and we don't read French too well.  Oh well, it was still lovely to see and we got a decent work out. Lots of people were jogging, bicycling, and a couple were even using walking sticks. We viewed the peace monument. I learned that hiking through nature tends to give me right knee pain. Not sure whether I'm not walking right or what. I should really stop hiking. There are plenty of benches and cute streams to enjoy if you can't go higher up the hill.

It also reminded me a little bit of the parks with hikes embedded into San Francisco. The hike itself up to the top is not particularly difficult but not particularly easy either. Some parts are steep and you'll definitely work up a bit of a sweat. Its totally worth it though, as you'll get the best view possible of Montreal from the top, particularly around sunset. You can do the whole thing in an hour and a half or so if you are in a rush for time. If not, I would suggest bringing a book, some friends and maybe a bottle of wine--  spend an additional hour or two relaxing at the top soaking it all in.

292,"Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead (the same guy who designed NYC's Central Park), this park is located on Mont Royal (the ""mountain"" that gives Montreal its' name).  It's made up of a walking and biking trails that wind their way through trees, a small pond, a chalet and belvedere with awesome views of Montreal's cityscape, a lighted cross that can seen all over the city, the Oratoire St-Joseph (a shrine known for its miracles), and the early city cemeteries.   Probably the most visited place in the park is the chalet and its' belvedere with absolutely the best views of downtown Montreal, the St. Lawrence river valley and the mountains beyond. (If you only have an hour to take in the park, this is the thing to do.)  But I also enjoyed the rest of the park too, particularly the Oratoire and the George-Etienne Cartier monument with its' Tam-Tam drummers. The Oratoire is gorgeous and gives free guided tours but check the website for more information.The park covers about 500 acres, so be prepared to walk everywhere.  There also is the height factor and the top of Mont-Royal is about 700 feet (about 290 m) and the grade is steep.  To go straight up to the chalet, there are stairs from the downtown entrance on rue Peel...a lot of them.  You can take a more leisurely route to the chalet by following the walking paths with its' signs but that route takes much longer.  Luckily, the park signs will direct you everywhere, but it's still nice to have a map of the park or to at least have read up on it.   Don't care to walk the park? You can rent a city bike or you can get a horse-drawn carriage (and in the wintertime, a sleigh) to take you around the park.  There are also a few city buses that stop at the cemeteries.  The buses and carriages cost and there are several carriage companies in different locations to choose from so it's best to check the internet for this. To hoof it on your own two feet, the park is free. It's really nice to bring a picnic lunch to enjoy.  The only bathrooms I found were at the chalet and the only amenities' stand (except for the occasional public drinking fountain) was also at the chalet.  The shortest way to access the park is from the rue Peel Metro Station (if walking) or the Guy-Concordia Metro station (if taking the bus to the cemeteries), but you can also use the Mont-Royal Metro stop to access the northwest corner of the park  (but it's a much longer hike).  I wound my way on foot through the park and saw everything in a little under 4 hours.An absolute must for anyone who likes nature or panoramic views.",5,6/11/2009,Lindsey J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ksQQ8Ff0BgmQ3X7NG3GVhg,"Billings, MT",Parc du Mont-Royal

If you can, rent a paddle boat and enjoy a leisurely ride around Beaver Lake. At $10. CAD for 30 minutes it was a bargain. My daughter loved it. Theres so much to see and enjoy here and it's free. I was one of the highlights of this beautiful city.",5,6/28/2010,Scott B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PamWn4FZwRiCYMdTw4lhcw,"Santa Clarita, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
300,"You should read Amanda C.'s review (just before mine) to get a true flavor of this wonderful place.  We drove up there for the 180-degree view of the city and we weren't disappointed.  It was a warm day at the end of September and we took some fantastic panoramic photos from the top of the Mont.  Of course, the ice cream sandwich made it even more enjoyable.   Definitely make a stop here if you're in town.",4,10/28/2013,Sam Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hw5X5ptcQBNOpgYB1H-_MQ,"Berkeley, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

303,Parc du Mont-Royal has probably one of the prettiest views of a city. It is definitely worth going to. Probably one of my biggest highlights.,5,10/18/2011,Katya M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sVCtNP1J6RkRSMER-noZtg,"Winnipeg, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal

305,"You can never compare the wonders of immense nature in a city with another that is simply a concrete jungle. In fact, this somewhat compares to New York's Central Park. With so much action and adventure, summer is the best time of year to hang out here. You can picnic, play games or cycle, jog or walk, or just people gaze. It's a bit of a hippy playground which thrives on the tam tam jam culture but this park is just as fun in winter. I've not personally been so far but it's good for winter activities such as snowshoeing, toboganning, et al. Just ideal for those amused by typically Canadian outdoor activities. This is one of the best places to hiss away or go with a large group and is one of the larger parks that I've been to. Best part is that it's right in the city's heart. Can't go wrong here!",5,2/18/2011,Urvi S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Hx7dVqWMV9pEtmp6S-PnIQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
306,Pick a sunny day. The views are incredible from the Chalet. Wish I could see it in summer. Take the 11 bus if you don't want to make a long hike.,5,4/4/2011,Bert H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=spPg1-v7trF35-Bd08_TNA,"Omaha, NE",Parc du Mont-Royal
307,"Every truly great city has a great park, and Montreal is no exception. Mont Royal is a lovely place to take a stroll and it has the best view of the city. We entered the park via the entrance with a billion staircases. I thought I was going to die. But then you get to the top and take in the view, and it's completely worth it. There is a way to access the park without the stairs, but I'm not going to tell you about it because you probably need the exercise if you enjoyed as much of Montreal's fine cuisine as I did. It was a chilly, yet sunny, day when we there, so I can only imagine how the park must come alive in the summer. There was a recreational-type area that was being renovated. There are also two cemeteries that border the park and make for some interesting wandering if you have the time. This is a must is you are a visitor to Montreal, and I envy the citizens of Montreal who get to enjoy this lovely park on a regular basis.",5,12/16/2012,Tonya T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LXaljJzVn5Qenw-p-hGjYA,"Austin, TX",Parc du Mont-Royal
308,"I did not exactly do any research before heading up here (I sometimes forget that yelp has ratings for anything other than dining establishments. Actually, I often forget that there is more to life than eating in general, for that matter). My thought process was, ""Well, I'm only up here for a while and I've got some free time; I should try to make it to the top of that big hill over there."" I went up via the two-lane gravel road off of park avenue, coupled with the massive set of stairs. The quicker way, for the record, I found on the way back, which is to go up the gravel switchbacks off of rue pins right behind the McGill campus. Either way, at the top of the steps, going left and up a further gravel path leads one to the Chalet, with some local vendors and excellent views. The better view, in my opinion, is had by going to the right at the top of the long staircase and then following the path there for a couple hundred yards. There's a small platform with sweeping views to the northeast.I was also interested to see that someone else had alluded to seeing a band shooting a music video up there. When I went up myself (6/27/2011), there was a bigtime video production going on at the top near the chalet, with trucks full of equipment and staff directing people around the filming site. Must be the cool thing to do around here.",5,6/27/2011,C. W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oHpBPEl16yu5adL3CuThEw,"Arlington, VA",Parc du Mont-Royal
309,"originally landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted (Central Park, Prospect Park, Belle Isle Park), the park is the heart (and lungs) of the city and its ultimate recreation destination--think:  walking, running, cycling, hiking, skating, sledding, skiing, snowshoeing, etc.",5,4/26/2011,Anthony K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
310,"I went to Montreal a couple of weeks ago for the first time.  I'd always wanted to go and thought I'd like the city and it didn't disappoint.  One of the best parts of the city for me though was Mont-Royal, and I didn't even see half of the park.I actually visited the park twice during my extended weekend stay in the city.  I went up to the park via Rue Peel my first time.  I would recommend heading up to the park this way, or at least heading down this way if you can.  It's great starting from the city and looking up Rue Peel to Mont-Royal.  You also get to walk through the McGill University campus on the way up.  When you reach the park via this route you can immediately access Chemin Olmsted, a walking path that was originally designed as a gravel road for horse-drawn carriages by Fredrick Law Olmsted.  This is the scenic, winding and easy-going way to see the park.  It's great because you're largely surrounded by woods, other paths, and little streams and waterfalls depending on where you are.  However if you're in a hurry and went to get straight to the top, you can take that route as well.  Once you get there you've got the Chalet and a great view downtown, the St. Lawrence and beyond below.  On my second visit to the park during my stay I decided to cut through the park rather than take the metro back to my hotel.  I was in Outremont which is a quite a hike from downtown.  However it was a great hike as I went through the park along Chemin Olmsted.  It was a bit of a dreary and drizzly day, but the park was still beautiful.  There were still bikers, hikers and runners out too.  If I loved in Montreal I'd be in the park a few times week, Winter, Summer, Spring and especially Fall.  Montreal has a real gem in Parc du Mont-Royal and it's one of the highlights of the city.",5,5/16/2011,BLAUGRAN A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8Lsb95PA1neTdCywiQ0_2Q,"Milwaukee, WI",Parc du Mont-Royal

312,"I took the stairs.  Counted in terms of normal flights on the way down, and figure it is about 15 flights all told.  Really good workout in a nice environment.  Views are fabulous.   Lots of families, exercise enthusiants, and tourists, but not so crowded to feel claustrophobic.  Beautiful open space at the top.",5,8/15/2010,Christiana D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UChcmYigzDZrVdNJ28JibA,"Vallejo, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
