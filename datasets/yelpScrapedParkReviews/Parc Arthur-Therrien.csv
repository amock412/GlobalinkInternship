You can get a pretty good view from here.Also, it's a bit of a mini-Mont Royal in that, there are great views at the top of the hill of the Montreal skyline which looks great particularly in the evening.The skateboard park is constantly full of skaters practicing and doing crazy things, the pool is always full and with the new Verdun municipal beach which is located behind the Verdun Auditorium, I have a feeling this little park's popularity will skyrocket in the next few years.",5,5/15/2019,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Arthur-Therrien
1,"Verdun beach isn't quite ready yet but from what I see potential is there! They have sand, a lifeguard, clean water to swim, drinking fountains, showers!! slides for kids and a fun climbing wall. It's still under construction but open for business! I'm so excited for this addition to Verdun. The park nearby is gorgeous and really clean. It has lots of land, tennis courts, outdoor pool, baseball diamond, skate park, splash pads, public washrooms, trees for shade, bike paths. It's almost a secret because it's not crowded. It even has views of Montreal skyline! Great place to enjoy the outdoors in the city.",5,6/26/2019,Crystal P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tcDMAC6kvF0iN-kqcjD5Dg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Arthur-Therrien
