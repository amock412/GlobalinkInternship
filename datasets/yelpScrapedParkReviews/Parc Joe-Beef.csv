0,"Such a fabulous family park!  Great summer time free fun for the kids. There is something for everyone and it's enclosed so super safe.  There's a small kids playground, bigger kids playground, water splash area, small soccer field.  There's also two other areas that I'm not sure what it's used for.  Lawn bowling but on tiny pebbles?  Haha. Sorry...I'll have to research that one.  For you loungers...plenty of picnic tables, benches, and green space. Dog lovers beware:  No dogs allowed. The sign says there's a $300 fine if your dog is there. Not cool for animal lovers but I get it. Last thing you want is for your kid to roll in the grass right onto some dog poop.",5,7/8/2018,Jolie C.V.

1,"My son loves this place - but I suspect he'll outgrow it quickly. The play structures and water setup are new and nice. The soccer field - while equally new - is terribly maintained (grass is too long in some places while entirely missing in other areas - for huge patches).I wish the playground had a basketball or tennis court instead of the ""gravel field"" in the parc's SE corner. I've NEVER seen that spot being used... and don't know what it's for!",3,9/16/2018,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Joe-Beef
2,"I've never reviewed a park but since I have a 4 year old I might as well start. This is a new park south of the canal. Here's how the scene goes:-Some scattered young kids, mostly unattended, some as young as 7 years old with no parent in sight.-Some locals sitting on benches chatting-A few random people having a snack on a picnic table-Some 20 something dudes playing hackey sack-Old retired people going for a walk through the park-People walking home from workSo, as you can see from what I described, the main attraction is not the play structures, it's just a small green space that locals use.There are 2 play structures (one for big kids and one for toddlers) and a splash pad however the big kids play structure is in full sun so the slides are generally too hot to use on a real hot day but the toddler slides have some shade.Really, this is a great spot for locals but not worth driving to if you are not in walking distance as the play structures and splash pads are pretty generic. But, if you do insist on driving here anyway, there is free street parking if you're willing to drive around a bit to find it.",3,7/22/2018,Kathy S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Joe-Beef
