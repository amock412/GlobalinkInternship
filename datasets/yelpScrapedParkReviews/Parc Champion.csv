I'm not one of those ppl that sees this 'hood as a ghetto I love the shops, the people and the spots that make it special But this park is just disgusting and sad It's all that is wrong with Verdun, it's that badThe water is lined with garbage and beer cans With a strong foul odour that we just couldn't stand It's the type of place that would make any nature-lover weep So much potential but lacking much needed upkeep.------------- Installment 25 poetry reviewsThis park was such a disappointment. We discovered it on another bike ride down the river. I suppose the main park is a simple open grassy spot good for a picnic or family gathering it's bordered by trees near the bike/pedestrian paths and there are a few spots to head down to the water edge......But your view is the Champlain bridge and all the construction blended with so much garbage even the several pieces we did pick up (for sake of trying to respect nature) didn't make a difference in how gross it was here. Skipping this place from now on. It's a shame, the trees are beautiful over the water.Ppl, seriously: RESPECT nature: clean up ur SH*T!",2,9/10/2018,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc Champion
