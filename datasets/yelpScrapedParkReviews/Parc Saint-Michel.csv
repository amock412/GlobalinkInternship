0,"This is a very cool park it combines all my favourite things : water activities, relaxation area, kids playgrounds and a soccer field. Yes this part is not perfect since it doesnt have a huge picnic area like La Fountine or free wifi like other parks but if you have kids thisis the place to be in the summer. A big water/splash area park and next to it a challenging playground devices to kill all that extra energy. Trully a small kids paradise.",4,8/10/2016,Tomer N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,"Ottawa, Canada",Parc Saint-Michel
