1,"No protection for those walking through the park! Ice everywhere! Terrible! No salted paths. I even slipped and have 3 fractures! 8 weeks in a cast! BAD! #MakeSidewalksSafeAgainIn other news, I like the dog park and other facilities this place has to offer. Just can't understand why they go through the time and money to make a skating rink but not take care of the crazy dangerous walkways to get to the rink itself.",2,1/31/2017,Sarah M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,"Montreal, Canada",Trenholme Park
2,"Lovely park with loads of space to enjoy a picnic,a stroll or a small bike ride. They have a dog park for puppies to frolic. Nice playground for kids to play & a splash pad for them to cool down in the summer. Well maintained soccer pitch as well.They officially have an indoor volleyball court & rumour has it that the coach works you hard to get your skills up to speed.",4,5/25/2016,Sabrina F.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1Fz81SDs6kLN6ZiSL0vdmw,"Montreal, Canada",Trenholme Park
