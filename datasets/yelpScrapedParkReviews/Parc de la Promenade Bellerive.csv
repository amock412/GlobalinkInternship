So on a not-too-hot Saturday end of July we set out from Mile-Ex to Parc Bellerive with the intention of catching a ferry there over to the îles de Boucherville National Parc. The parc itself was bigger and more lovely than we knew, we could have just hung out there. On that particular Saturday there was a festival happening celebrating Mexican culture with food and a big stage with live music. Families spilled out beyond the gates of the festival, picnicking and BBQing in the parc. The park runs along the waterfront, it's wide and breezy and full of trees and water access for splashing with puppy dogs or doing some fishing. There is a cute gazebo near where the ferry docks. The ferry runs every hour on the hour till 5pm in the summer and costs $9 including your return fare. It's perfectly setup for taking bikes over to the islands, we had a great time and can't wait to go back! The parc Bellerive itself is 22 hectares, we didn't explore it all but it looks like a great place to go for a run, or hang out with your family and friends and watch the rushing water of the Fleuve St Laurent.",4,7/27/2015,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc de la Promenade Bellerive
