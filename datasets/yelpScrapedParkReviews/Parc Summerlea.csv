0,"Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood is putting a lot of effort into making the lives of its residents a pleasant one, Morgan Park is one of those improvements, and honestly, what's not to like about that place? The beautiful fountain at the entrance, the landscaping, the two playgrounds for kids, the exercise trail, the numerous restaurants surrounding the area (location, location! Chez Bouffe is located a few steps away) as well as the two water games areas linked by a stream. Yep, this family-friendly park is definitely one of my favorites in Montreal.",5,9/29/2017,Cindy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Summerlea
