I'm not sure where else outdoors in Montreal has such beautiful, wide, sweeping views of the city. It's like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, but with less traffic and people, and better views.Mount Royal Chalet is located on Mount Royal, the small mountain in Montreal the city is named after. We took the long way to the chalet by hiking up the mountain from the west-side entry point at Pine Ave W and Peel St. The quickest and easiest way to get to the chalet is by parking in one of the lots off Remembrance Rd and walking up the Olmsted Trail from there. It's probably about a short 10-minute walk from the lots.The chalet, which opened in 1932, is home to what's called the Belvedere Kondiaronk. It's really the belvedere that's the main attraction here. It's spacious and has quite the overlook. It's large and faces southeast over the city. The vista is breathtaking, day or night. We came at sunset.The chalet itself, which is open daily 8am-8pm, offers Wi-Fi, food and drink, a gift shop, restrooms, and an information desk.If you're visiting Montreal and have never been to the Mount Royal Chalet, I definitely recommend checking it out. The small walk/hike is worth it.",5,2/9/2020,Daniel B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,"Atlanta, GA",Chalet du Mont-Royal
1,"Phew, long walk to get up to this viewing point, you go up up up until you are above the skyscrapers of the only French speaking metropolitan outside of France. People looked at me and went - wow, will this guy Everest! Very cool city skyline view. You have to push to the front among all the tourist crowds a bit to get a clear frontal view, unless you are 7'8 tall. One of the best places in the city.",5,11/10/2020,Matt G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=188nNkbt92KZoF4QtF7ApQ,"Morrisville, NC",Chalet du Mont-Royal
2,"Quite a hike to get up here especially from the southside of the park and especially when you are wearing snow boots in the winter. It is a beautiful view when you get up there but should be quite honest, it's nothing spectacular. As a tourist, I would do it just to say that I've been. There is a building here where you can buy coffee, tea, baked goods and use the bathroom. I bought the hot chocolate and it was absolutely disgusting. I was furious. Bathrooms were clean though.",3,6/11/2020,Angela L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sBjpUbgILjlck5BD-flF9Q,"New York, NY",Chalet du Mont-Royal
3,"Kondiaronk Belvedere is one of the best touristic attractions in Montreal. Situated in the park of Mont Royal it offers gorgeous views south including downtown Montreal, Saint Lawrence river and even Mont Saint-Hilaire. The Chalet du Mont Royal located at the same spot is a beautiful building one should visit. It also has some important facilities such as coffee shop and bathrooms. The view point can be reached easily by car from Cote de Neige. Parking space is abundant and payed. Alternatively take the Rue Peel Steps, 15 to 20 minutes of climbing and you will be rewarded with beautiful sights. Must do during every season!",5,1/1/2020,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada",Chalet du Mont-Royal
4,Well worth the hike -- especially in the autumn. The view of the city is unbeatable from here. The reds and yellows really pop and walking through the trees while trekking up the mountain is an unforgettable experience. There is a crazy amount of construction these days though so be prepared for a slight detour when ascending the staircase!,5,10/22/2019,Lyndon D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nrBJLGDdv6QmnAK_sV2OOQ,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",Chalet du Mont-Royal
