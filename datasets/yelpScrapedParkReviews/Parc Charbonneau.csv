0,"What a nice discovery driving along the quiet area nearby. Was looking for a small park to play soccer with the kiddo and I stumbled upon this gorgeous super park that has recently been renovated with a beautiful new play ground and splash pad. The kid loved it. The whole play area is so great and innovating!There is free and very accessible parking.Park Charbonneau is going to be a family favorite. Lots of place to play games, soccer and volleyball areas. Even a small mountain during winter! There's the option to have a picnic too! You can also go near the water and feed the ducks!",5,8/2/2018,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Parc Charbonneau
