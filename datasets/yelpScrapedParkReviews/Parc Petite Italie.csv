Like right now! Yay reviews from mobile!!",5,9/28/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Sup√©rieur, Canada",Parc Petite Italie
1,"Pleasant little park near where the start of little Italy lies. There are many large older trees to catch some shade on a sunny day. The park is one of Montreal's gem urban spaces. In a city where the action never stops, the horns and sirens honk and blare it's important to have green space as a sense of sanctuary for the people to relax in nature and find peace whether it's to have kids run around, a picnic or just chill under a tree. For those that see people dining in the park with picnic baskets its a clever idea from Triple Crown dinette. I'm actually surprised no other restaurants in the area have caught onto the idea also. It's rather ingenious. Sometimes a few creepy characters hanging around but if you mind your P's and Q's they shouldn't bother you. Otherwise a great place to go and chill or relax in Spring-Summer or Fall.",4,8/22/2015,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada",Parc Petite Italie
