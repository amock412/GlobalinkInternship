0,"Parc des Compagnons de Saint-Laurent is a-ok!  Not amazing, not horrible either.  Green space is always a good thing, and this park is a welcome oasis on Mont-Royal, just East of Papineau.  Lots of benches, a few picnic tables, and a gigantic communal stone picnic table, make it a great place to stop and savor a croissant from Copains D'abord, a gelato from Peche Glace or even a sausage sandwich from William Walter.  Where we find it a bit lacking is in the play structures: there isn't much variety, and what there is isn't all that fun (at least not to me, nor to my 3yo who isn't so into swings).  But there's sand, and that's a big draw in our family. And during the summer there's the Ludotheque, a shipping crate full of toys to borrow and play with, books to read, and assorted other fun stuff to make up for the play structures that don't get us all that excited.",3,9/10/2018,Amanda C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"Montreal, Canada",Parc des Compagnons de Saint-Laurent
