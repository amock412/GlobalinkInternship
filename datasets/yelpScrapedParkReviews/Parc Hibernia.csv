0,"Nice neighborhood park for kids. Will be better soon when renovations to the park (new building, re-done baseball field, and children's play pool) are complete. When will that happen? It's Montreal, so you're guess us as good as mine. Despite reno work, there are still nice community events occasionally. Examples: movies in the park at night, a PÃ©tanque charity tournament that's great fun for adult and kids, etc.One caution: the (plain looking) park immediately west of this one (no border between) is, I'm sad to say, a bit sketchy. I'll leave it at that. Hopefully that gets addressed.",4,9/22/2019,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Hibernia
