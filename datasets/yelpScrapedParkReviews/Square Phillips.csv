It was spring and coming from Asia, tulips are very rare in my hometown, so imagine my joy when I saw the budding tulips. I fell in love with this quaint little park.",4,6/1/2018,Mar L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A9zcyzP8JKOOKkQnKd0I4g,"Chicago, IL",Square Phillips
1,"Nice little square in the middle of the busy office & shopping district. During the summer, there are a few stalls selling handmade jewellery, flowers, fruits and house plants. If you work nearby and want to enjoy your lunch outdoors, or if you are just passing by and take a break from the hustle & bustle, this is a decent little spot.",4,6/9/2017,Fatema Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,"Montreal, Canada",Square Phillips
