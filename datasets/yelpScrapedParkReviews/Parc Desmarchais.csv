0,Best place to go and relax. I've been coming here for years and I wouldn't go anywhere else.There's lots of places in the park that arePacked with people but there's a few spots that you can actually get peace and quiet. Weekends are madness so come early afternoon during the week for picnic or just to think. Love this park,5,5/23/2017,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Desmarchais
1,"Covid warning - very few people here seem to be observing social distancing rules nor are they wearing masks. The riverside parks and Verdun and LaSalle have been packed solid the past few days because of the warm weather. Runners, joggers, bikers, strollers, families doing BBQ and picnics, kids, couples, guys hanging out downing a couple of brewskis together, they've all been here in droves. I've seen very, very few people keeping the social distance rules or wearing the required masks. I don't think people seem to understand the gravity of this pandemic and are just treating the warm days as some kind of vacation holiday. I don't mean to be a killjoy but Quebec is the epicentre of the Canadian pandemic. Think about it, People.",4,5/24/2020,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Desmarchais
2,"Super lovely park! Another extension along the parks all along LaSalle Blvd this one starts in the Desmarchais street area (how surprising) of Verdun. Available parking in the lot next to Crescendo, but plenty of possibility to park in the street too so driving to enjoy this park is perfectly reasonable. Nice pedestrian bridge in the area, the path goes along near the water with many benches and lovely grassy spots to throw a blanket for a picnic. There is also a boat launch area that many people were trying to access today (finally a super nice day!!)...but unfortunately city workers had it blocked off temporarily to place buoys (surely as part of the flood warning measures). We will definitely be back with Irie, lots of dogs walking with their owners enjoying the lovely trail too. A beautiful relaxing spot!",5,5/12/2017,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc Desmarchais
