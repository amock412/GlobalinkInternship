0,"It's pretty...but it's not the best of the LaSalle Blvd Parks, in my opinion because u can't really sit anywhere too close to the water. We sat right next to the water but it appears we sat right in the middle of a walking path as we unfortunately realized by the time the 3rd set of pedestrians n pooches came by. This park seems like it might have some good spots to cast out n fish from, however I didn't catch a glimpse of any signs that either authorized or prohibited fishing in the park, will try n take a better look around next time. Plenty of picnic tables and benches and big open grassy spots to set up a picnic up the hill from the water though. Would be willing to check it some more but not my favorite spot so far.",4,5/23/2017,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc du Quai-de-la Tortue
1,"The Verdun part of the chain of parks along LaSalle Boulevard and the southern-most shoreline of the island, which run through Verdun, LaSalle and Lachine all the way to the Mercier Bridge. It is also probably the narrowest of the parks.I'd say the best parts of this park at the wharves which are great for star-gazing during Â summer nights. During the day, they are full of swimmers, fishers and pot-heads who seem to be drinking beer all day long. The hiking trail is also pretty fun too esp. for spotting turtles, snakes, Canadian geese, and muskrats.",4,5/27/2017,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Quai-de-la Tortue
