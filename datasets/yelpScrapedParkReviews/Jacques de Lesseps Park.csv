If you want to impress a date, have a romantic picnic, hang out with a friend, drive around aimlessly contemplating life itself, this is your spot. There is a park spot with some bleachers and a parking lot, both are great for plane watching. You will need a car to get here and if it's cold I don't recommend watching from outside. But in the summer, bring some picnic chairs and watch away!",5,11/3/2018,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada",Jacques de Lesseps Park

If you are an avid plane-watcher, you can't miss this!",5,5/21/2014,Jen H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=asClRoz4wmU67loe3d4ynQ,"Ottawa, Canada",Jacques de Lesseps Park
