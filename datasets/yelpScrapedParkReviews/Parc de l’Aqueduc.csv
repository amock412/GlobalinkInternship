0,"Upon a dock, out in the nightWhile fishes sleep beneath the tideStanding still out in the light Beneath the birds of graceful flightIn the quiet calm of waves in turnOr in the day when sunlight burnsAs the breeze catches the grass and fernsLies a place to heal infirmed Fishing pole in hand and beach blanket in tote We come to sit and peacefully soak In the rays of sun and watch ducks floatAnd forget about the daily woes -------- Installment 45 poetry reviews Another oddity being fixed right here, this review was a long time comin. And I felt it needed a poem.We really like this park to fish and relax at and it has several ""spots"" we like to try and ""get"". It's a fairly busy/popular park, but usually we still manage to get 1 of our 3 fave spots. Unfortunately there are some socially inept morons who frequent this park as well, so despite getting a good ""spot"", some a$$hole may still decide it's ok to come fish 5 feet next to you thereby cutting you off on your spot... Unfortunately the only way to deal with these people is to flat out tell them they are being stupid and to please go away because otherwise they will snag your line and make things worst. Please don't be like these nitwits: if you see someone in a spot: give them a good fishing zone and find somewhere else, it's only polite and neighborly. Bonus points: they added outhouse bathrooms, which means I can stay fishing longer and don't hafta leave to go home to the bathroom. Also every Tuesday and Thursday they do actvitities in this park. Thursdays consist of setting up a whole stage with live performances by the water: last Thursday's Creole music was absolutely perfect while we fished to our heart's delight!",5,7/22/2019,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc de l’Aqueduc
1,Great location to have a picnic or to catch someFish.I First discovered this location after a picnic with family and I have been coming by ever since.Located right off the bike path you'll find a million geese (depending time of year) and many people relaxing on the long wooden benches.The water is strong here so you'll always see people fishing and paddle boarders as well as jet skiers.Great place to relax,4,7/6/2020,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc de l’Aqueduc
