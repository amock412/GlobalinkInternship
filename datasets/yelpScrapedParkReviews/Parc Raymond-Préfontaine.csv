0,"This green space behind the metro station has a kids play park, kids pool, a bocce field, baseball field and a skate park. There's also a few picnic tables and benches where people come take a break during lunch. Not particularly well maintained judging from the height of the grass but I stop by for some shade during lunch or my coffee break.",3,7/25/2017,Konstantina P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",Parc Raymond-Pr√©fontaine
