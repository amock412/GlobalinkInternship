The bike path goes right through it so it's a beautiful spot to stop for a bit. Features: - Picnic tables- Benches- Swinging bench- Courtyard type area- Bluff overlooking the water- Paths that lead down to the water in a coupla places- Water is calm near the shore but currents pick up about 10 ft in, approx. depth 4-5 ft of water, not much seaweed, lots of rocks",5,7/15/2018,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc Ranger
