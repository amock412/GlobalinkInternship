0,"The 7-day Tour East Bus trip that I'm traveling on stopped here; we have 50 tourists in our group.The $222.50 attractions package includes access to the Whale Watching Boat Tour, Thousand Island Boat Tour, Hopewell Rocks, Maritime Museum, etc., of which this attraction is one of the experiences.Known by many names such as the Olympic Tower or the Montreal Tower, this inclined tower structure features an observatory at a height of over 170 meters or 558 feet. The stadium was built for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games.A quick trip up the tower and then back down again can be accurately summed up by the pun word (or nationality) Russ...ian!In its time, the tower was an engineering marvel.  It's still a must see monument if you're visiting.",4,7/19/2018,Leonard E.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=deB6EXuanGiN1tkSASuh3A,"Toronto, Canada",The Montréal Tower
1,"From the outside, I think most people will find that this tower looks incomplete and quite ugly.  However, Star Trek fans might imagine this as the USS Enterprise NC-1701 being under construction, with the tower being the neck, and the stadium being the saucer portion.  Maybe I'm a just a crazy nerd...indeed...$23 gets you a ride up the glass slanted elevator. The observation deck provides some nice sweeping views of Montreal, obviously.  There's also some exhibits about the history of the 1976 Olympic games, which this city seems to be overly obsessed about. Not sure if this is worth $23 alone, but entry is covered by the Montreal Passeport($99 for 72hrs), so it was worth it for me.",4,12/20/2017,Chun P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IzJ36jX6V6ky5BtoN-Agng,"San Diego, CA",The Montréal Tower
2,"While I'm not a fan of heights, the Olympic tower was anticipated by me mainly because of the fact it's the largest incline tower in the world and apart of your Olympic history experience in Montreal. Once again I had the Montreal passport card and was able to just get into the tower with this card (the card also got me access to the subway, for which the station is right in the stadium). First you that a like incline railway up to the tower (very beautiful and scenic, not really scary because the railway amazingly stays horizontal while riding up the tower. Once you get to the top, it's nothing but high views of Montreal and beyond. The reason why this tower is a little underwhelming is because I have done quite a few other towers in other cities, and they would include exhibits on the city and whatever else and this tower has nothing. Not long to do at all and will not take up your day in the least. Nice place for beautiful views but theirs a lot of places for that in Montreal and this place is more a few miles out of downtown.",3,11/3/2019,Daron D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9Zu4BPDntg_52YmNwViyOA,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",The Montréal Tower
3,The Montreal Tower is the highest inclined tower in the world and has some incredible views of Montreal. The ride up is pretty cool and way faster than I expected. When you get to the top you can hang out and check out the views for as long as you like. There is also a small gift shop at the top. In the bottom part of the building there is an interesting exhibit about the Montreal Olympics and the use of the stadium in the years since. There are other activities nearby and between all of them you could easily spend most of a day in this area.,4,6/22/2019,Kristina K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=k_TavHq78rXiNcv81M7Fog,"Jacksonville, FL",The Montréal Tower
4,"Definitely a must-visit if it's your first time in Montreal.  This was built for the '72 Olympics and is attached to the Stade de Montreal next door.  The admission for the funicular/tower is separate but you can buy a combo ticket if you go into the Stade first.This tower offers a 360 view of the city of Montreal.  I appreciated the information available under the windows to let you know what you're looking at.  We went on a kind of cloudy day so it was a bit hard to see everything, especially Mont Royal (which is probably the best thing to look at).  It takes a bit of time to get up here and get back down if there's a lot of people so prepare to wait a bit.  There's also not really good air conditioning in the waiting areas so it's a bit hot in the summer months.  There's a public bike station on the property so it's a great spot to bike to/from if you're on a tour of the city.",4,6/4/2018,Jenna S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,"Chicago, IL",The Montréal Tower
5,Very cool architecture. Good views. It's cool to imagine what it would have been like here during the 1976 Olympics. The entrance fee is reasonable.,4,4/1/2018,Saira K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OV6JZ1M5ov65F8PWQzhG-Q,"Atlanta, GA",The Montréal Tower
6,"Interesting perspective of the stadium and surrounding grounds but is it worth it?On our recent visit to Montreal, we bought tickets and rode the funicular.  It is easily found from the subway.  It is a unique experience, but, upon further reflection, I'm not convinced it was worth it.  We did have great views and could spend as much time as we wanted at the top.  I feel like we got a better feel for the area by walking around.  If you are an avid Olympic fan, you'll be sure to enjoy. Otherwise... I'm not as sure.  I would budget, from standing in line for the tickets to getting off the funicular and exiting the building, about an hour.  Also the area doesn't have many restaurants.  If you are planning on lunch, be prepared to walk a few blocks.  We did and were delighted.  If you are planning a visit to or from the insectarium or botanical garden, it is an easy walk with good signage.",3,7/1/2018,Teri D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=T2RyZACHEdEgd6ZQTejv_A,"Grand Prairie, TX",The Montréal Tower
7,"If you're a non-resident and you are paying admission and parking, this is not worth your money unless you have a thing for going up in towers....which apparently we do. It was relatively cool to look at and neat to be at the top but you can tell the 1980s decor is old and tacky. The elevator ride is cool both up and down but if you have seen one view from a tower, you have seen them all. The gift shops both at the top and bottom are pretty weak and the place seems sad and abandoned. I have been to a few old Olympic parks and they all seem like a huge waste of money as they are super expensive and dead when the games are over. Drive by to take photos but not worth going to the top unless you just want to say you did it....which apparently, we did.",2,5/10/2018,Marv G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ovpj9rUjj_SpDBGwaFWoQg,"Largo, FL",The Montréal Tower
8,"The Montreal Tower Observatory is attached to the Olympic Stadium, a place where they hold sports events, salons, fairs, shows, exhibitions, film shoots, social events, and many more.  There are 56,000 seats in the stand and the whole amphitheater is covered.  I was able to check this place out while the Boston Red Sox was in town, playing against the Toronto Blue Jays.  It was unbelievable in terms of the turn-out, as there were true-blue Sox fans and true-blue Jays fans.  Accessing the stadium is easy, as it's right off the Pie-IX stop off the Metro.  Don't forget to check out the Montreal Tower as well while you're there, as it's considered the tallest inclined tower in the world; it takes about 2 minutes to get to the top, and you're able to see the city of Montreal up there.  Highly recommend in getting here via the public transportation.+right off the Pie-IX Metro stop+attached to the Olympic Stadium+tallest inclined tower in the world",3,4/2/2016,Hannah H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,"Alexandria, VA",The Montréal Tower
9,Well worth the metro ride to check out the great view of Montreal with the nice glass-encased funicular ride up.,5,4/6/2018,David H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jMpBkmBHjrkECTA_THZtfg,"Brooklyn, NY",The Montréal Tower
10,Definitely a great visit if you have time to head out to the Olympic Park (you can take a super easy metro ride there). The view is incredible (even on a cloudy day) and you can spend as much time as you want at the top of the tower! I'm usually scared of heights and did just fine at the top. Touring he stadium was awesome as well. Our tour guide was super knowledgeable and I totally geeked out seeing the Olympic pool.,4,10/1/2018,Danielle S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SQz4dTwmWHYvQlMh3z8Rgg,"Brooklyn, NY",The Montréal Tower
11,"Want an incline and a view without shelling out nearly $25 for 10 minutes?Go skiing instead.They have package deals where you can go to the observatory and the planetarium thing, but it'll cost you like $70 per person.Total waste of money since the Olympic park is boring.Having been to the Beijing Olympic Stadium I can say that this one is boring and outdated.But, it's a piece of history, hence the 3 stars.",3,3/12/2015,Jack R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZMocFA2lNMJeiKjguUKu7g,"San Francisco, CA",The Montréal Tower
12,"Incredible! It was over $25 but it was well worth it for the views, including of the botanical gardens I had just visited and Old Montreal, where I had stayed. So beautiful!

13,"Went on the guided tour of the Olympic Park of Montreal led by Jeff. He was a great tour guide who clearly knew his history. He was able to answer every question asked by people on the tour.

14,"It was a bright sunny day yesterday and Gord and I took the metro (subway) to the Montréal Tower.At 165 metres, the Montréal Tower is the tallest inclined tower in the world! Its 45-degree angle is awe-inspiring, especially when you consider that the Leaning Tower of Pisa's tilt is only 5 degrees!From its summit, visitors can admire the entire Greater Montreal region and up to 80 kilometres of the St. Lawrence River valley. A breathtaking panorama, it has been awarded a three-star rating - the highest available - by the renowned Michelin Guide!Visitors can reach the top of the Montréal Tower on a mesmerizing climb in a glass-encased funicular that holds up to 76 passengers.The funicular is the only one in the world that operates on a curved structure. It has a hydraulic system that allows the cabin to remain horizontal during the two-minute ride to the top.The views were great!There was a booth where you could have your picture taken and then email it to yourself. Of course, Gord and I did .  There were models of the tower and Olympic Stadium.It was definitely worth the trip as the views were spectacular!",4,3/30/2015,Teena D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,"Toronto, Canada",The Montréal Tower
15,"We took the tram up for the 360 degree view of Montreal. I usually forego these attractions because I think they are a rip off. However, since this was included in our Montreal Passport, why not?  Ride up was smooth and you get to see the city on your way up. Afterwards, you can spend as long as you like at the observatory. This reminds me of the Peak in Hong Kong and the Empire State Building.

16,"For $18 a ticket, I think it's pretty steep to go up that incline (no pun intended).  And the day we went it was overcast so the lady said the view is reduced.  Asked if she could reduce the price and she didn't even entertain the idea.",3,12/15/2015,Rasheed B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UPyyAYLeXdU3-t502I6DSA,"Vancouver, Canada",The Montréal Tower
17,"To get to the top you take a cable-car type elevator which gives you a great view and is kind of fun. There's really not much to say about the tower except that it gives you excellent views of the Olympic Park and all of Montreal, as well as the St. Lawrence River. If you're looking for scenic pictures, this is your place. Also there's the bragging rights of saying you've been in the world's tallest leaning tower.It has a gift shop at the top as well, and interactive monitors that tell about some of the things you can see in and around Montreal.",4,3/23/2016,Ryan A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZbgS4WttNQLyYn9zRD_htg,"Yokosuka, Japan",The Montréal Tower
18,"The Observatory Tower is really a cool place to go! From above you can see the entire city (or big part of it). The good points are that it is cheap compared to other ticket prices, the staff is friendly, there is a digital map, pictures etc.They have a photo boot where you can take a picture with your friends and email it straight away and for free! I liked the souvenir boutique as well.The things I didn't like were the fact that the binoculars work only with a 1$ coin and the timing is about a minute. The glass of the elevator was not very clean. It was very cold, so take a jacket with you :)",4,8/26/2015,Kamy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fiKR50Wxuu-6YzuotTeRnA,"Montreal, Canada",The Montréal Tower
19,"Amazing building, the Olympic Tower in Montreal is the tallest inclined tower in the world, at 175 metres. It was built as part of the 1976 Olympic Village, and you can visit it by taking a funicular to the viewing platform at the top. This has one of the best views in Montreal, though a little pricey for what is essentially a trip to the top of a building and back ($15.95 for adults, half that for children). I think most people combine it with a trip to the neighbouring Biodôme or other parts of the Olympic Park but I just wanted to see the strange architecture of the tower.",4,5/19/2017,Judy W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ehzvSXsijzgxsYHvXeaS-Q,"Hamilton, Canada",The Montréal Tower
20,"I was at the tower for a wedding reception in October.  The facility was wonderful and the views were spectacular.   The location and parking was very easy to get to if you drove in on your own, as for ubers or taxis couldn't pull into drop guests off so they had to walk down the long tunnel area to get to the entrance.  The gondola experience heading to the top of the tower was a wonderful way to appreciate the views of Montreal.  Overall the experience was one of a kind for a wedding reception - but I am not 100% sold on visiting if I didn't have a true purpose.",4,11/8/2017,Kim M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=y6XND93XjeWFwznZiXhMsw,"Bloomfield, NJ",The Montréal Tower
21,"While visiting the Olympic Park in Montreal, my daughter and I also paid to go up the Tower on the Funiculaire.  The tower is the tallest inclined tower and it supports the roof on the Olympic Stadium.  It was not there for the 1976 games, but was build 10 or 11 years later (during the Olympic games there was no roof on the stadium).  The ride up the tower is in a double decker, glass elevator.  It goes up the outside of the tower giving an interesting view of the city.  Once at the top you have a 360 degree view which is quite good especially on a clear day.  There is also a gift shop on top.We enjoyed it and found it worthwhile, but the tickets are a little on the expensive side even with the favorable exchange rate at the time.",4,7/31/2018,Georgia A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EmQCQ4IbousiY35BN2_TuQ,"Meriden, CT",The Montréal Tower
22,"Simple design but you can't beat the views. You really get a nice panoramic layout of the city with Mount Royal in the back, downtown, and the river and islands. Make sure to come on a sunny day. Montreal can look quite dreary when it's cloudy. Plan to spend about 20 minutes up here. The elevator has views of the areas east of the city, which doesn't have much.

25,"Great place to spend the day with family or a group. A lot of history in this place.

26,"Let's state the obvious: $18 a ticket for a (maybe) 3 minute ride that is definitely showing signs of wear is a bit of a rip-off. But I was a tourist coming to Montreal and I was damned if I wasn't going to see this. If you're even mildly afraid of heights, you will probably want to skip the elevator ride on the incline.If you aren't afraid of heights, you will enjoy the brief 270 degree view of the city. You will see buildings, water, and Mount Royale, if you're lucky. If you're here on a foggy day, you won't be seeing much -just like me.

29,"I'm going to go with 4 stars.  It's great, but it can't compete one on one with the grandeur of Toronto's CN Tower.  The unique feature about the Inclined Tower at the Olympic Stadium of '76 is that it is the tallest free standing and most inclined concrete structure in the world.  And that sort of feat, in the 70s, was most likely to make for some severe budget overruns ... and it reportedly did.Set on the grounds of the Olympic Stadium and adjacent structures such as the aquatic center and an exhibit of different bio-systems with representative animal life, the site is captivating for the extensive sculpting of these buildings and for the stark eery feeling of these shapes set against these vast open concrete plazas around the Olympic complex.  They are impressive, though they are starting to look dated and there is epoxy that should be applied here and there.  I'm sure the facility management team has their hands full.  The Expos used to play in the stadium below the Inclined Tower and cables from the tower hold up the stadium's roof cover.I really recommend going up on the Inclined Tower to its observatory if you haven't been.  The Metro exits are Viau or Pie IX.  One goes to the rear of the incline and will see a 2-story elevator that makes the sloped ascent.  The height is about 60 stories.  The price is ok and AAA/CAA helps a little.  Now, compared to the CN Tower, the perimeter up top for viewing the city is slightly constrained, though it has a good angle and a good view.  From the tower, you can see Centre-Ville, Sherbrooke St. connecting the center to the Olympic complex, the South Shore, Ile Ste-Helene in the middle of the river, all the major bridges including the Jacques Cartier, the hill of Parc Mont-Royal, and more.  It really gives one an appreciation for Montreal's spectacular island setting.",4,5/3/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",The Montréal Tower

31,"Every major city has a place that offers a great vantage point to overlook as far as the eye can see.  This is Montreal's.  Located in Olympic Stadium, circa 1976, it is nested next to a planetarium and the famous Biodome.  While the ride isn't cheap, for first time goers it is worth the money.  You take a bi-level gondola up the sloped side of the building, enjoying the views at you ascend.  At the top, there are panoramic views with large windows to better viewing and at it's center, a gift shop.  There are no food vendors but if you head down one level, there are seats and tables where you can bring your own snacks and drinks to enjoy.  Definitely something not to miss if you're visiting Montreal.",3,5/16/2013,Kevin L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Mz7J88FvXDEAN69Lfz2ySg,"FOREST HILLS, NY",The Montréal Tower
32,"At something like $18 per person when bundled with a Biodome ticket as of last week, I think they've reached a point where maybe the price has overstepped the value of the experience.The elevator ride up is pretty cool, and the 270-degree view of Montreal once you get to the top is nice.  Off in the distance, you can see the cluster of skyscrapers of the core downtown area alongside Mont Royal.  That might be the best part of the view, although it's far enough away to be a bit underwhelming.  A much better view of downtown is available by walking up to the chalet at Mont Royal.Of course, that's not the fault of the observatory. The cityscape is what it is, and it's worth something to be able to see it from this vantage point.  It's just not worth $18 per person, in my opinion. Still, if you're a visitor to the area you should do it just to have the experience.Side note, it's evident especially on the elevator ride up and back, that this landmark has been falling into some state of disrepair (not in a dangerous way, but lots of old, peeling paint, etc).  It's sad to see, because it's a beautiful piece of work.",4,4/17/2013,Jeff K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YTdNcIWAt2nEzZ7NY-fniw,"Orlando, FL",The Montréal Tower
