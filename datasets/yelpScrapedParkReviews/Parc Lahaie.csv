0,"Lovely Mile End park! Small compared to Laurier or Jarry but a god city block long and lots of trees. This park went through some renovations recently and it seems like there is more art, more fountains, more flower beds, and more places to sit, all of which is lovely. The park sits in front of a beautiful Montreal church and is just a short walk from a little strip of cute clothing and houseware shops on St Laurent, and fresh bagels and delicious gelato on Fairmount, so it's a perfect spot for a break from walking around. In the winter there is usually an installation in the middle with Christmas trees for sale, a small stage with live folk music, and a roaring fire. Which is my favourite.",4,7/20/2016,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Sup√©rieur, Canada",Parc Lahaie
