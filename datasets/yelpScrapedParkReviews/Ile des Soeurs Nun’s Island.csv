0,"I come here a lot and it just occurred to me to review it.It's a nice island, It looks beautiful in the summer and they have lots of parks and bike paths. A great place to have a picnic or go to the pool.Walking around is always pleasant and towards the end of the island there's a nice workout spot next to Saint Lawrence River. I really enjoy going to Mamie Clafoutis bakery and Sushi Palace.However, there are lots of mosquitoes and it is quite far away. The only public transportation that will take you there is quite unreliable. In the winter time, it's not somewhere you would go unless you lived there.",4,3/19/2016,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada",Ile des Soeurs Nun’s Island
1,"I HAVE experienced better islands, ok? I thought about giving this island 3 stars, because there are some very cute and affordable little bungalows on it, and a winding little river with willow trees, and moments of feeling like this would be a nice place to be a kid, but let's face it, now it's mostly condos that ate the shoreline and demolished what should have been protected habitats for all kinds of endangered birds. These were wetlands basically, and now this is just another network of roads linking another pile of mini strip malls, and glass spiked office buildings, and depressing boxlike housing where we can stash our elderly and a few young families looking for affordable housing and last I checked they don't even have recycling pickup.",2,11/8/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Ile des Soeurs Nun’s Island
2,"Nun's Island is one of the best residential areas in Montreal. There is a lot of green space, community parks, walking paths along Saint Laurence river with memorable views. There are also well maintained sport facilities and community center. The island is 10 min away from downtown, the Old Port of Montreal and Atwater market. There are biking paths that connect the island to Ile Sainte Helene through the ice braking bridge running along Champlain Bridge, as well as biking paths going to Lachine cannal.Snow cleaning and collection during the winter is well organized and may be one of the best in Montreal (difficult to compete with Westmount).Best part is kids play on my street during every season. Cons: growing property prices, over construction in some areas, lack of second primary school the borough of Verdun still can't figure out the right location for.    P.S. There is a recycling pickup since I moved in some time ago.....",5,11/10/2013,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada",Ile des Soeurs Nun’s Island
