0,"We've had a family membership for just over 2 yrs now and we're very happy at Midtown. The group classes are great -- Andre, Carole, Kostas are amazing (the rest as well, but they are our favourites). Some classes get fuller than others, but we've never felt over crowded.  The tennis courts are fantastic. We love having access to indoor courts through the winter. They can be hard to book, specially during evenings and weekends, but we usually manage to find an opening. Leon and Francois are really great trainers. The summer camp for kids is excellent. They just renovated the showers in the ladies change room, and in general the facilities are clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. Jean Christophe at the front office has always been very approachable and accommodating.The cafe serves good food and smoothies, but -- and this is the one thing I dislike about the club -- the service is always really slow. Expect 30 mins for your food, even if you're the only ones eating. We usually just head elsewhere, but in the summer the terrace is very enjoyable (as long as you don't mind waiting to eat). The free indoor parking is also a plus.",5,2/12/2017,Andrea M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aud-Vk1VFYBYxxVSSwkMIw,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
1,"I tried this gym out to see if I wanted to sign up. I've heard positive things, but after visiting, I have no idea what the hype is about. MOLD under all the mats in the women's locker room. Walls falling apart. It was not easy to find the spa. The women's locker room is a maze. I tried the 60 mins massage and the masseuse talked half of the time. I couldn't relax at all. It was not an enjoyable experience. And for the price, no thank you. Will not be returning. Do not recommend.",1,6/10/2016,Nicky C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hJ5ESTUlFmiRp3tjr0c2-A,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
2,"Midtown athletic club considered a prestigious club in Quebec. I have to agree with the fitness classes. Great spinning class! A must try. The weight training and tennis courts are a pleasure to use. However my review is mainly based on my experience with the cafe and good service. There is a beautiful out door area to have a bite and take a dip in the sauna. I don't know why a prestigious club would have dirt scum bobbles in the water. You just feel like running in to the shower after going in. Can't say it was a relaxin experience. Once I sat down out side for brunch, the menu was quite pricy but we are at A prestigious club and if you can afford the membership costs them paying 11.00 for two sunny side up eggs and a few fruits is fine. Now you'd expect great service right ? Wrong !  It took 40 min to get out order and the place was empty. Then once we finally got the meal. I can't say anything about the food itself. It was sunny side up eggs hard to mess that up and the fruits were fresh. The bread was multigrain, maybTu pense que j ai pas de peine moi? Que je n ai pas de sensibilité ? Pourtant tu commence a me connaitre et a savoir comme je suis une personne sensibele that why the meal was an extra 5.00 ;) Having been in the pool and wearing a bathing suit I asked for more coffee and when she poured it, she didn't both moving or taking the cup.  She poured the coffee me , not a drop it was a lot! On my leg and foot. All I got was a bag of ice and the she avoided to come back to offer anything else. The kicker is I got the bill with out any compensation. Wow I have to say the service here stinks! You mess up you fix it! Poor service and hight price = fail",2,8/12/2015,Dan P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
3,"I like the women room with all comodities, sauna, bain vapeur and jacuzzi, plenty of towels and showers; the club is big so you have to walk a lot to make all tour ( tennis, yoga, spinning, restaurant, indoors and outdoor pool ! Enjoy if you can afford it.",4,8/29/2017,Pat M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
4,"This is probably by far the worst gym in Montreal in terms of management, employees and overall atmosphere in this target high end gym  People are patronizing and their restaurant service under the M Café banner, is indeed a blatant example. In the same way as other comments made up to now, some of the staff are being treated as much as their  second home and categorized members and labelled them. Outrageous. Fiercely competitive environment. Some trainers do no fit Since there's no such thing as perfection, this is named a 220,00 price tag. Among other things, looker rooms are getting tired ...",1,6/3/2018,N M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ssf4nti7gCAc3Xvz2zcnLg,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
5,"5/5 for the gym. Hands down the best gym in the city; quality equipment, clean, and not too busy. The free indoor parking is also a big plus, especially for winter. I like the fact that the weight room always has a trainer present to help you if you have any questions or looking for a spot. The Midtown is the most complete gym experience in Montreal.Concerning the Midtown Bistro/Restaurants,  the food is average and the service is awful - but I don't blame them, who goes to a gym to eat. If you looking for gains and you about that life, dont eat a salad... there's a McDonald's a few blocks down.",4,8/15/2015,Jimmy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KNRwbAKYzHXjaWGQJc_pTg,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club

7,"Club staff is so rude,  and provided no customer service at all.  Beautiful club with horrible service. Very disappointed:(Not friendly to children, although selling family membership.  Pool always not available for kids, only 3 hours per week.  Daycare for kids never open, and workers there are not professionals, not safe...  Don't leave your stuff, it will be stolen:(About food, had 2 times gastro, after eating there:(",2,12/17/2013,Inga T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XVAYJnuriob6HkooUYim4g,"Verdun, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
8,"The management with Jean Benoît and François Leduc was a catastrophe, very unfriendly, after 8 years going with all my family , paying vip lockers and a lot of extras, I decided to quite because the rudeness of the staff and the management, they just told me ok you can leave LOL very professional !!!! There is much better places in Montreal that they value customers.",1,2/21/2016,Marco S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=J-3K4jevnIO_Q85fCR3RkA,"Mount Royal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
9,Very nice gym with very rude staff! Kid running around in the summer time with no parental supervision under the staff's uncaring eye! Very unfortunate that this place has such mediocre management!

10,"It's a nice gym but with a TERRIBLE service and staff! Couple of us tried to have lunch outside and we ended up serving ourselves. From running after a waiter who did not came once to our table within 30 min to getting our own utensils and after running again after him to pay?! Up front they have two large water pitchers which are never filled w water anyway! Once I tried to ask the personnel to fill it up only to get an absolute rude answer that she is super busy. (There was no one at the bar btw). I understand staff could get overwhelmed, but if you consider yourself as a 5 star sports club-HIRE MORE PEOPLE! Anytime I try to order something it's like asking them for a HUGE favor, sorry to remind you but this is what's called your JOB. And on top of it, any orders takes FOREVER. Trainers at the club are such a gossipers! How can you feel at ease and relaxed when you can't even discuss your personals. The guy who registered me did not tell me about available programs, discounts and available specials as a new member. So the moral of the review is that for the money they charge they are not worth being paid half.",2,7/21/2014,Alex C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CFQ4o5PfKp_gFMQ4HDkb0Q,"Chicago, IL",Midtown Athletic Club
11,"Je participe régulièrement aux rencontres Yulbiz. Celle d'hier avait lieu au Midtown Le Sporting Club Sanctuaire. L'établissement est certainement apprécié par ses membres qui s'y entraînent mais j'ai été déçu par la salle de réception où avait lieu notre activité. L'éclairage y était assez sombre pour qu'un collègue compare le lieu à un salon funéraire. Par ailleurs, pour un lieu qui reçoit des gens d'affaires, j'ai trouvé cela amateur de ne pouvoir uniquement payer comptant et sans remise d'une facture.",2,9/29/2010,Adrien O.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=e9ZmTHdWGxwdvSra5GbVlQ,"Montreal, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
12,"Don't waste your time with this gym. There only concern is making a sale with your membership and lack any customer service. I just dropped my membership after the first month and wasted my time and money. Staff is extremely rude, have no interest in helping you and I never get answers to my questions. The food is horrible and I had my items stolen twice with no care or concern. There only care is to sell you membership then you never here from them again. Don't waste your time here or get fooled by there phony claims on there website. Your better off going some where else in the city where they look at you as a human being and not dollar amount. Way over priced, horrible staff, money hungry, below standard facilities and they refuse to correspond to you via email. Also not do not share any personal information with this gym including your phone number, address or personal email. They will gather this information to harass you to join without asking you !!! avoid at all cost !!",1,2/4/2015,Jean Isah W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PIEUCEzOlB2c1xR-rgseKg,"Pointe-aux-Trembles, Canada",Midtown Athletic Club
