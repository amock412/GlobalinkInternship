0,"Perfect little park tucked in Little Italy across from Napoletana. This is an excellent option for picnics, especially if you happen to have a set of balls for petanque or bocce (I do not, and am terrible at these games, but I enjoy the heft and roll nevertheless.) There are also excellent hiding places here, ivy covered arbours and the like, if hide and go seek is more your speed. This is a small park, but extra sweet.",4,8/6/2012,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Sup√©rieur, Canada",Parc Dante
1,"I love this little park! It's quaint, gets loads of sun throughout the day and has plenty of benches, if you're not one to sit around in the grass! It also has a bocce ball area - cause no park in Little Italy is complete without - and is located near some of the neighbourhood's finest italian bakeries & coffee shops, in case your sweet tooth takes over or you get thirsty. It's really a fine spot to just chill and take in the summer sun.",4,7/25/2013,Katherine B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4YDE_B5VWhCa8sbkUmEkVg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Dante
