0,"This park is no Mount Royal, and there are plenty of alternatives, but it still made for a great afternoon nature walk with the dog. Saw some woodpeckers, plenty of people and dogs, and there are at least 2 chalets (start and mid way points) with ski rentals, hot chocolate cash machines, and public restrooms. Winter trails dedicated to and marked for hikers, snowshoers, and skiers. Had a pretty nice walk of about 6-7km. I do agree with some other viewers though that the proximity to high speed routes and residential areas does take away from the ""nature vibe"".",3,1/30/2016,Paul D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qWGy5yKXlOo3QUl1fswKGA,"Quebec City, Canada",Parc Nature du Bois-de-Liesse
1,"Nice spot to go cross country skiing or for a walk in the woods, but not spectacular, there are prettier waterfront areas not at all far away (e.g. Hudson) and more fun cross country ski trails in the city (Mount Royal.) If you are looking for a small green adventure on the island, sure why not, but I wouldn't hugely highly recommend it. We parked and followed the arrows that suggested we'd see water. We ended up crossing under a highway on our nature walk, getting led in a loop that pointed back to the parking, walked past 2 Germans laughing at us for getting duped by the same path as they had followed... but we had keen eyes and spotted another entrance into the forest, so we crossed a busy suburban street that feeds the highway and did find the water we'd been promised by the many signs, and though the sun was just setting on the islands and the river and it was pretty, the highway was still in sight, the roar never quiet.",3,11/28/2011,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Sup√©rieur, Canada",Parc Nature du Bois-de-Liesse
2,"Nice woods, especially by the water. The noise from Autoroute 13 which you hear through most of the park really runs the nature vibe, however.",3,9/23/2015,Bruce B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V0QEzwE5JTVbkjdjOjMveQ,"Paris, France",Parc Nature du Bois-de-Liesse
