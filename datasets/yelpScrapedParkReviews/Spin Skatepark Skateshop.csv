0,The place is pretty small but every ramps were made very well! They have many vending machines but no cafeteria. The Skateshop is very nice and have a large selection of boards. All in all its a great place,4,8/11/2015,Hannah B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cI_MtWHCIeL3ErDityfvuQ,"Brossard, Canada",Spin Skatepark Skateshop
