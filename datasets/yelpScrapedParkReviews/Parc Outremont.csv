0,"Parc Outremont is great for running, lounging, picnic-ing, and playing frisbee. I remember running laps around this parc for PE, hanging out in the parc during breaks, eating outside with family. It's a nice friendly parc. It is very family oriented so no alcohol is allowed, also it ""closes"" at a certain time so you can't really loiter around after hours.It's a great, green and relaxing parc. There's a pond and a kids playground.",4,5/17/2016,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada",Parc Outremont
1,Very small park for this area. But it has pound with fountain in the middle. It's not big as deep  and water has strange color and smell. There's no water fountain for drinking. But u can find small place for kids with different fasilities,3,8/8/2019,Svetlana V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yKvfqx0nthgBBGC2MkrWWg,"Lower Nob Hill, San Francisco, CA",Parc Outremont
2,"Another sweet tucked away Montreal green space, surrounded by old Victorian red stone houses, populated by local families, kids on scooters and bikes rolling through the paths. This is not the BBQ picnic scene of Laurier or Esplanade (because I think technically Bbqs are not allowed here... But it's been known to happen ;) It's a much more low key neighbourhood shady tree block with fountain bubbling, nothing fancy, just the scene of some of those truly sweet Montreal moments outside of time.",4,8/19/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc Outremont
