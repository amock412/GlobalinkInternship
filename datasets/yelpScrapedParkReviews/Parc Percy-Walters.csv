0,"I am in love with this Dog Park.  I came from NYC with my husband and 5 puns dog, we had tons of dog runs there , nub nothing as nice as this park.Lots of space for the dogs to run around.  People are friendly and for the most part responsive towards their dogs.  The park is clean and the grass is well taken care. Water is available.Small dogs are mixed with big dogs.  I would like better if the small dogs had an gated area for themselves, but it is not that big of a deal.  If the big dogs are friendly towards my little one, I can hang out there for a while, and if I see they are a bit more rough, I just leave.",4,10/18/2015,Vivian D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dxZJaS858DFT9sMVAElYrw,"Santa Monica, CA",Parc Percy-Walters
1,"Yes this is a big park with lots of space to let your dogs run around. However this dog park needs to be better organized or regulated. Dog owners come and leave their dogs to run around without any oversight. We saw 15-20 dogs running around and only 5-6 people in the park. There needs to be a small dog sectioned off area. Our small puppy got attacked by an aggressive German Shepard who kept trampling on him and biting him. Thank god I was right near my pup and was able to wrestle him away after a few minutes. When we yelled whose german Shepard this was, No one would claim him. Someone told us it belongs to an old guy but he was nowhere in the park. Long story short- big park but beware of irresponsible dog owners with aggressive dogs because it is an off leash park.",1,5/28/2018,Katherine L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9mYYBfKIOI8z2Gc6Ra1D0w,"Seattle, WA",Parc Percy-Walters
2,"This is the best dog park I've been to! 10/10 would recommend. I've recently moved to Montreal, and, found this to be a nice haven for my dog. I was initially hesitant about all the big dogs that frequent the park, but what is truly great- most of the people who come here are regulars. All the owners you I've encountered are responsible and keep a good eye on their dogs. There is no separate area for small dogs but most of the small dogs come to the park from 3-4 (here's a tip for all the small dog owners)!",5,5/18/2019,Amina M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5lqJKJfuhNe8fgqgQShcUg,"Waterloo, Canada",Parc Percy-Walters
3,A lack of snow removal in the park has allowed the snow to pile so high in some parts that i just saw a dog jump out of the park.,3,2/10/2015,Ivan M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tAtblebDRTiB9TkAxupncQ,"Westmount, Canada",Parc Percy-Walters
