0,"All roads lead to the canal and this is one of the many entry points to the canal.  It's the closest one to me so we use it often.  Also, if you've been walking a while and need a little pick me up, just head up Peel as there are several places to grab a quick snack (Starbucks, La Bete a Pain, Dairy Queen, along with several restaurants), before you continue on your trek along the canal. If you want a healthier option, there is a gym that has a snack counter that makes smoothies and other power drinks.I wish I knew more of the history to share other than this area used to be no mans land but had become an up and coming area if it's not already there with its fabulous food scene and designer interior decor boutiques. It's a beautiful mix of old and new. On one side you have  great views of the famous Farine Five Roses building. Across the canal you have an endless line of condo construction all seeking to outdo the next with amazing amenities.  It's all gorgeous.",4,6/17/2018,Jolie C.V.
