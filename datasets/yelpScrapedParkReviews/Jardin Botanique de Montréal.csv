0,"The botanical garden is just a beautiful sight to see, the flowers are all more impressive than the others and the colours are definitely mesmerizing. I recommend going there on a sunny day, so you can really capture the beauty of it. It takes about 1-3 hours to walk around and appreciate the different gardens but it's definitely worth every penny!!Don't forget to go inside as well, the plants are also impressive",5,5/19/2021,Joana Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
1,"Um, in a time when I can't travel---the memories of being here in January lift me up so, so much! I spent a few hours at the Botanical Gardens in Montreal and so enjoyed it! My favorite was seeing all the coffee trees (I'm obv a coffee fanatic) and the tropical fruit trees. Also for things like mandarin/banana trees, it was so tempting to take some of that fresh picked fruit, but obviously I had to be a good samaritan and not touch it as the signs indicated. All in all - my experience at the botanical gardens was amaaazing and I think it should definitely be on your list of places to visit when in Montreal!",5,5/7/2020,Alex L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NNL1zLTP2J_SOputgoPYeQ,"Buffalo, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
2,"What a breathtakingly beautiful place with all types of colorful blooming flowers, green grassy areas, blue bodies of water and more! My favorite gardens were Chinese Garden, Rose Garden, and Flowery Brook. Upon entering, you are privy to Reception Gardens which are tall trees, flowers and a walkway leading to a fountain and the stately, impressive library on the grounds. My friends and I then started off going through the greenhouse exhibition grounds, which was my least favorite portion because I'm not really a fan of greenhouses. Most of it was warm, tropical with cactuses and green plants. I did like the orchids, bridge, and pond though. We continued on to the Rose Garden and Aquatic Garden. Roses are my favorite flowers, so I enjoyed this garden immensely. There were pinkish-yellow, red, orange, pale pink, purple, yellow-colored roses, as well as a pretty arch and statue of a joyful young girl. The Aquatic Garden were different pools of water with little fountains. It was very calming and refreshing to walk through it. Next was the Chinese Garden which was incredibly impressive! The entrance was through a foresty bunch of trees with red and gold lanterns hanging up above. There was also a red and black pagoda and inside the pavilion, crystal blue clear water with lantern art of fishermen and boats, orange and blue fishes, a huge bird, etc. All of this is surrounded by lush green grass, lilacs, pandas and bamboo lantern art display, rocks, Chinese style buildings, and a natural-looking waterfall on a rocky cliff. After that, we checked out the Japanese Garden which was not all that compared to what I just experienced in the Chinese Garden. There was a bonsai display, lantern art of cranes in the grass and a small cultural center. Then there was the Shrub Garden and Alpine Garden. The Shrub one was a little boring for me, but the Alpine Garden had this wild, unbridled beauty with all the rocks, bodies of water and different types of trees. We also saw the Lilacs and Flowery Brook, which boasted all kinds of flowers of red, pink, purple, white, orange, along with leaves of purple, yellow, green and more. It was truly a sight to behold and there was a large body of water with lily pads and marsh-like atmosphere.There were arboretum trails that we did not get a chance to check out, but I was very happy with what we experienced.",4,10/6/2019,Kathy X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RJH925_Ci598EuRx9JoGwA,"Brooklyn, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
3,"As of August 2019, the Biodome and Insectarium are closed for renovation. I believe the insectarium is supposed to re-open in August 2020. That being said, they don't really have any other exhibits if that's what you're interested in. They have different garden areas for different groups of flowers/plants (i.e. roses, lilacs). My favorite was probably the poisonous plants because it was interesting to read about them. Although they're not really blocked off so if you're bringing children there, you should probably keep an eye on them. I saw one little girl wandering into the bushes as the mom just looked on. Questionable, but not my place to say anything. Anyway, there's also a Japanese and a Chinese garden which were a bit lame.Overall, I'm not sure it was worth the price for what we saw. The price for an adult is $20.50. If you have a student ID, it's $15. I believe they have a parking lot for $12, but we were able to find street parking nearby. Just be mindful of the street cleaning/rush hour signs and you should be fine.Tip - allot yourself at least 2.5 to 3 hours to see everything. The park is huge, and that was already with us skipping some gardens. They have a golf cart that can take you across the park, with several stops - but it doesn't come very often and it's usually packed.",3,8/26/2019,Mel T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,"Hoboken, NJ",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
4,"Montréal's Botanical Garden is not something to be taken lightly. I recommend that you come here earlier in the day because it takes several hours to complete the entire garden. I think it took us about 3 and a half hours before we exited on the opposite side. For $20 a ticket, you definitely get your money's worth here. They have a nice handful of little gardens which are very pleasant to the eye. Our absolute favorite was the Chinese garden that is pictured in my review. It really was a beauty seeing all the dragons and pagodas and boats in this section. We spent a good amount of time here taking pictures of everything we could. If you start off from the side by the Olympic Stadium and Science Center, the garden will become less and less vibrant as you go on until you finally exit on Sherbrooke. If you start the either way, all the good stuff will be towards the end. I would definitely recommend that any tourist make a trip here!",5,8/19/2019,Emily P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mWcS4rFDDJOVMVuER-Cqzw,"New York, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
5,"Not the most breathtaking botanic garden that I've ever been to, but a nice visit in good weather nonetheless. We were one of the last ones to leave, around 8pm. Bring your student IDs for the discount.The assortment of greenhouse/hothouse plants was typical, nothing extraordinary.Sheep grazing the open pastures (part of the garden that had the trails) was a surprising sight!The best part was the Chinese garden: it was the most picturesque part of our experience. Take tons of photos! Really brings you to a serene, meditative place as you appreciate the beauty of nature around you.",3,7/9/2019,Kseniya K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wom1WWarGvu24KJi9tquSw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
6,"Photos by me.I went with two tweens and two males over 30.So the four of them made my visit unpleasant. And they were ready to go after the golf carted tour. Maybe 1.5 hours. I was so upset I left them to mill around the entrance and walked the ground by myself. Many of the attractions were still under construction and closed to the public. That combined with the fact that I had left four restless people made me marathon visit the gardens and wrap it up..... so: Information from Tripadvisor.com: Along with the Biodome, the Insectarium and the Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium, the Botanical Garden is part of the Montreal Space for Life, Canada's largest natural museum science complex and Montreal's top must see attraction.The Montreal Botanical Garden, one of the city's jewels, is recognized as one of the world's greatest botanical gardens. It offers a colourful program of events, exhibitions and activities all year long. With its collection of 22,000 plant species and cultivars, 10 exhibition greenhouses, Frederic Back Tree House, and more than 20 thematic gardens spread out over 75 hectares, it's also a perfect place to enjoy fresh air and natural beauty. Located just minutes from downtown Montreal, right near the Biodome and Olympic Park, the Montreal Botanical Garden is a living museum of plants from all over the world. You can also enjoy the Insectarium which is on the Garden's site.",5,8/25/2019,Theresa E.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RESphQbbAlyrQ613LwsMeg,"Bossier City, LA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
7,"I hadn't been to the botanical gardens since I had gone for a field trip many years ago with elementary school. I finally went back recently for the garden of light and it was quite beautiful. 16$ entry fee and definitely book your tickets for your timeslot in advance (online) if you're planning to go on the weekend , also keep an eye on the weather as it's all outside , it likely won't be as enjoyable in the cold or in the rain. The Chinese garden was very pretty , you almost feel like you're no longer in montreal. Definitely worth checking this out , I would curious to see some of their other exhibits. They do special ones for Halloween and various other holidays/themes. family friendly but also a nice idea for a date :)",4,10/2/2019,Patricia C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,"Hampstead, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
8,"I am a HUGE fan of botanical gardens so this was a must for our trip to Montreal.We spent quite a few hours here and probably would have spent more if it hadn't been such a hot day.The gardens are beautiful! I'll say it again for those in the back - Beautiful!There are lots of different sections - a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, a shady garden, shrubs, beautiful flowers, goes on and on.There are also little ponds and lakes here and there, adding to the overall beauty of this place.If botanical gardens are your thing then you have to come here and plan on being here a few hours at least.Loved it and I'd love to go back!",5,8/4/2019,Mudi K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HoX16kQE_osaTdw_Sh9tCQ,"Wallingford, CT",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
9,"I came here with my sister and we were impressed at the variety in flowers and plants there were! It was very easy to follow the map I was provided with.

10,"I actually was going to not visit this place during my time in Montreal. I'm really glad that I managed to stop by in my last day because this was absolutely beautiful. I'm pretty convinced that their prettiest views are in the beginning of the garden -- the lovely flower gardens, Japanese garden, and the cacti area. This botanical garden is huge. In addition to the three main attractions that I loved, there were so much more to explore. Although subjectively not as pretty, it was a good leisure walk through all the nature. Also, they sell your typical vanilla ice cream by the front of the gardens if you're craving a little treat.",5,7/8/2019,Ruby D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2U45IvKIFlIRdCBgVlOz5Q,"Brooklyn, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
11,"Jardin Botanique is an excellent botanical gardens and absolutely beautiful with many thematic garden areas. If you're coming from downtown Montreal, take the green metro line toward Honoré-Beaugrand and get off at the Pie-IX station. Upon exiting the station, go straight down Boulevard PIe-IX (R) up about a quarter mile to the entry of the gardens.  If you take a counter-clockwise route through the themed gardens, you will be able to experience first the Rose Garden, followed by the Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, Aquatic Garden, Shade Garden, Lesley Hancock Garden, Shrub Garden, Toxic plants, Medicinal plants, Quebec Corner, Monastery Garden, and many others.  There is also a nice gift shop at the exit point. We spent about three hours in duration and it was very relaxing, breezy, great weather and an all-around great experience. The garden is very well kept and very clean.",5,7/1/2019,Ethan T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,"Orlando, FL",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
12,"Food: N/AService: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor & Style: 4/5The Japanese/Asian architecture were amazing. Most of it was actually authentic; they had to break it down from the Orient, bring it to Montreal and re-build it! Are you kidding me?! Worth seeing if you are in Montreal for a few days. In terms of the gardens were were slightly disappointed because we thought we would be seeing the Sculptures that you see all over Yelp, Google, and the internet. However, the as the staff member told us, the sculptures are a competition event and they travel the world so therefore it is unknown when (if ever) they will return to the Montreal Gardens. Overall we had a good time here and the bug museum was interesting!",4,9/18/2018,Nick N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-gN7r8iOBKGeh4LJkn2QeQ,"Oklahoma City, OK",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
13,"Updating because after 20+ years of living in Montréal I finally went to the Butterflies Go Free exhibit at the Botanical Gardens. Honestly even crowded with annoying people and squawking teens this is totally magic and you should go. Try to go on a weekday morning if you can.You wander through desert cacti, spectacular ferns,  beautiful bonsai, and the warmth and smells just make the snowy melting grey outside go away. At the end of the wing you get to a greenhouse full of delicious smelling, butterfly-friendly flowers and the beautiful fluttering delicate otherworldly creatures are everywhere. It's magic.

14,"I have been to many botanical gardens, in multiple countries. And this is probably the most diverse, largest, and exciting gardens I have been to. There's so much variety in their gardens... From tree gardens to shade gardens to Chinese and Japanese gardens and children's gardens... It was all very beautiful. There are also lots of places to sit.... Including hammocks!! Which who doesn't like a hammock?!?! Also... There are sheep! Sheep! In the garden! Also... There are two separate entrances.

15,"This place is super cool. If you're looking for a way to spend an entire day in Montreal, you can walk around the gardens for hours. Plus, you can go to the other attractions in the Olympic venue. They even offer ice cream with chocolate covered ants on it.

No mosquitoes.  The on site cafe has creative and healthy food for reasonable prices.   Words can't really describe this place, so go look at the photos!$20 for adults, $10 for kids, but I had a 72 hours Montreal Passeport($99) which covered entry.  Worth it either way!",5,12/20/2017,Chun P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IzJ36jX6V6ky5BtoN-Agng,"San Diego, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

18,"While I visited Montreal, I discovered the Magic of the Lanterns and I loved it. I enjoyed Chinese fishing traditions and tales through colorful and magical lanterns.

19,"Unfortunately I can't say that this was the best botanical garden I've been to. The Bloedel Conservatory in Vancouver still takes the top spot for me.I was fully aware that the Chinese gardens were closed for renovations (they warn you of this before you buy your ticket), but what they should really warn you is that the Garden Sculptures are no longer there, unlike what the pictures proliferating on Pinterest tell you.The remaining gardens were on the lackluster side for me, and the map was a bit confusing but I guess breathing in some fresh air is a positive either way. The Insectarium was a fun side trip inside the gardens. Seeing the leaf-cutter ants haul food back into their nest was a neat treat. My favorite was the Greenhouse, which was actually a long chain of connected greenhouses, taking you through the various climates and displaying the plants that thrive in them.Overall, not the best botanic garden out there, but worth a stop if you have kids or loads of time to kill.  3.75",3,10/15/2017,Sylvia Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZdizwYwPiIlhK3G2u-fZnA,"Santa Clara, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
20,"Montreal's secret Garden- an escape from city life - Admission was 16$ with a 4$ discount if you're a local. Fare includes entry into the insectarium. I would recommend buying the tickets online to save the walk to the ticketing booth.There were several gardens to tour including the First Nations, Alpine, Japanese, etc.. Chinese garden is currently under construction. Every park was breathtaking! Zen by the pond and waterfalls. There were benches tucked away in every spot for your reading or relaxing pleasure. There were more shaded trails for those wanting to hide from the sun! The summer 2017 lineup includes live musical performances every Sunday - gets pretty packed as people bring their lawn chairs and picnic mats. Good for the family.A 2 hour tour will usually cover the whole Park!",5,7/16/2017,Norine A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,"Montreal, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
21,The botanical garden is absolutely beautiful! I was upset to miss the tulips but the gardens were really gorgeous and had tons of different areas to check out. As the morning went on the place got busier and more crowded. I'd recommend arriving at opening for a more peaceful experience. I spent almost 3 hours here just wandering around. It's near the Olympic stadium area (about a 10 minute walk) so you can find activities nearby to keep you busy for most of the day.

22,"We were on our weeklong trip around Montréal and wanted to hit up as many touristy spots as we could. Naturally, we found ourselves here on a Free Day. I feel for the people that paid to enter here; my expectations for this place may have been raised if I had to pay for admission. It's a cool place to take photos, so my friends Rafael and Mehek came prepared with their fancy cameras.For a place with free admission, it was surprisingly thorough and well worth the visit. The greenhouse featured several exquisite plant specimens from all over the world. Outside appeared to be several stands offering their plant goods. Maybe that's why admission was free on that day, in order to support these various businesses. That's just my guess, so don't quote me on that.There was also an insectarium clearly meant for children, with free admission as well.

The indoor garden was very clean and there was barely any bugs or flies. There is also a lot of nice bonsai trees.The outside was very nice too, there was random flowers here and there. I was kind of upset that gardens was not open, it would of made my experience so much better.

I usually bring a blanket to lay down and relax, last time i seen a bunch of baby fox running around and was super close to taking one home ( just kidding but no really they're adorable)they have the lantern festival which is a great way to kick your fall off!

Although it was mobbed with rude children and their equally rude parents, it was an afternoon filled with pretty things.I was incredibly sad to see that the staff working here did not protect the butterflies from all the visitors trying to pick them up or touch them. I had a minor confrontation with a gentleman because I saw him scooping up butterflies on several occasions. Aren't people aware that touching them damages their wings which eventually kill them sooner? Given the number of butterflies with ragged wings, I guess not.The green houses are beautiful. I worked really hard not to take a photo every single plant.The Insectarium was something new for me as I've never been to one before. I rather enjoyed looking at all the creepy crawlies.

Nope we arrived at building made of wood with a balcony and just explained about treehouses. Took all of 3mins to explore, the trolley waits 10mins and then takes people back to the exit.

The insectarium is also located within the garden and requires another ticket to enter. They are remodeling the Chinese garden so they drained the lake. Bummer.

40,"Our last visit, a number of years ago, was too late in the season to have enjoyed most of the gardens.  This trip was almost perfect.  I say ""almost"" only because the Chinese gardens were undergoing a major rehabilitation with nothing available to view.But the rest of the entire botanical garden was open and absolutely beautiful in mid June.Your ticket to the gardens also includes access to the Insectarium.  In addition to being an air conditioned and dry space to be valued on a hot or rainy day, it is also educational and very green inside.  Both children and adults will enjoy it.",5,6/27/2016,Roger K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qGSrT9FfUZAgY-Jm2Co9sQ,"Clifton Park, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
41,"This is my third time visiting the botanic gardens here. Because the day was an overcast April afternoon, my wife and I stayed inside and took in the Butterflies Go Free exhibit. Parking was $12.  We spent a couple hours here, and it was definitely worth it. The tropical indoor gardens weren't crowded at all, so we were able to take pictures without needing to wait on others. My wife loved the flowers and the butterfly exhibit because the tropical flowers and plants reminded her of Brazil.

42,"What we liked best about Jardin Botanique de Montreal is that it was nicely organized by theme or type of plant. My favorites were the edible plants and the Japanese Gardens. I was also a big fan of the houses such as the insect house and a conservatory.The conservatory in particular (and it might actually be called something else) had informative videos and interactive exhibits that taught me about pollution, suffering wildlife species, and the environment. I could have stayed there a lot longer than I did!There were nice paths and plenty of places to relax. I would have preferred better descriptions of the plants or sections. There were only signs with the name of the plants but no additional detail.There were also roads and grassy expanses that seemed incongruous with the rest of the botanical gardens.

43,"Montreal has several areas with notable attractions with only one of major import being east of Centre-Ville.  That would be the Olympic Village.  The first things that people notice and may want to see are the Inclined Tower and the stadium, nicknamed the ""Big Ow"" for its final price tag.  I've reviewed the Inclined Tower.  Also on the same side of the street and adjacent to the stadium and the tower are the Biodome, a natatorium, and a few other points of interest.  The Biodome is worth visiting at least once.  I've also reviewed it.Because it was across the street and because one is conditioned to usually having a city's botanical garden be free of charge, it took a while longer to finally get over and see it across various trips to this unique city.  It costs somewhere in the $20 CDN range and I believe there was a discount for holders of the AAA/CAA card, as was the case at the Inclined Tower.  Once you get into the Botanical Garden, you really understand how large it is and the care and maintenance that it requires.  And you're glad you went in and paid that tab.  The grounds are laid out according to themes, sometimes with areas of where the plants come from geographically, sometimes as formal gardens, and sometimes according to the season in which they bloom.  About the bloom schedule, this sort of information is available, is sort of consistent across the years, and, if this is a key factor of how to time your visit to Montreal and the Botanical Garden, then you will need to work around that to see the types of plants and flowers you'd like to see.  For most people, I would assume that a visit to Montreal is based on other things, such as autumn color change, summer weather, a music festival, or a sporting event.  Two gardens or exhibits are especially interesting, yet very different from each other.   There is a Japanese pavilion with the more restrained horticulture and art you'd expect to see.  On the other hand, the Chinese exhibit and garden is larger and a lot more elaborate, with a pond, foot bridges, and structures which, to most people, would appear to be authentically Chinese in their inspiration.  There is also an insectarium with (interactive) displays at the Botanical Garden, and it is included with admission.  And, in the middle of it all is a lake with lawns around it.The Botanical Garden can be reached by car, and there is an ample sized parking lot, and it can also be reached by transit, either by the Metro or by bus, both of which stop practically next to it.  It can be visited in conjunction with a visit to the other attractions across the street or by itself.  Of all the attractions in and around the Olympic complex, my nod goes to the Inclined Tower, followed by this - the Botanical Garden - followed by the Biodome.  The Botanical Garden is beautiful but, because of it being different during various parts of the year, will present you with an experience that will please you more ... or less, relative to another visit.  Regardless, I'd be willing to go back and shell out almost $20 CDN at the ""right"" time of year.  I enjoyed it.",4,5/22/2017,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

46,"Reviewing this long after a day spent here it's gotta be said if you haven't been here whether you're a local or out of towner you must go here. If you're gardener or have even a slight interest in plant life you must go. There are countless species of plants in the world, I'm certain a large portion of them are here and what's great is so many of the plants and gardens are not native to the region and some not even the continent giving you a chance to to see jungle, desert and mountain Flora and fauna and much more. A day could easily be spent here and you could write a review about it spanning pages. Inside and out there are many exhibits to see and learn about. Out on the grounds there is much to explore too - dozens of flowers, an insect exhibit, even weeds and poisonous plants it's all here. I'd recommend to the old and young, local and foreign.

49,"We decided to visit despite being warned by the hotel concierge that she had gone a week or two before and many of the exhibits were under construction. We got there at about 2:30 PM on a Sunday. Parking is a flat fee of $12. You pay at a multimeter and then place the paid ticket in the dash of your vehicle. There was a fairly short line to get tickets and 3 tellers, but it took forever!!! 2 out of the 3 people that were being tended to were getting tickets for large groups and practically arguing with the garden staff as to their discounts... We finally got our tickets after about 20-25 minutes in line. The ticket person was very nice and accepted my AAA discount. The 1 site rate is $20 CDA for adults and $10 CDA for children. The AAA discount takes off about $1-2. After getting our tickets we started walking through the gardens. The gardens are very big. One thing that seemed to pop up when googling the garden is a few large sculptures, the most notable being a large one with a large head, hand and waterfall. We were later told by staff that that had been taken down a while ago. So mush of the garden seemed to but under construction or incomplete. One thing that saved the trip was the insectarium which is located within the garden grounds and included in the price of the garden admission. It was very informative and interesting.

50,"We had the pleasure of visiting earlier this week (mid-June), taking the Metro in, which dropped us only a couple of blocks away. I've been to several botanical gardens and this is one of the best. In particular,  the perennial garden and alpine garden (forest?) were outstanding. In a couple of weeks,  even more plants will be in bloom,  but many were already in color and impressive. Beyond the perennial beds,  when you get near the ponds (water lilies,  etc) there is an area lush with peonies, irises and other beauties and is not to be missed. In two weeks or so,  the roses will all be blooming and should be spectacular.  The onsite restaurant food was surprisingly good and not terribly overpriced. The greenhouses had a wide variety of flowers,  ferns, desert plants and an impressive bonsai exhibit. Great photo opportunities at every turn.  Glad we read several reviews and ignored those who talked about empty beds, etc... Just saw so many wonderful sights here,  we were impressed! Easily, you could spend three or more hours here and not touch all the bases.

52,"I think we said ""Oooh, look at that"" maybe once or twice throughout the botanical gardens. This is clearly not a garden meant to cater to all season. We came on July 20th and most flowering plants were either dead dead or just plain wilted. The ground are just okay overall.We were particularly upset that it cost money to park ($12) AND you HAVE to pay ($20) per adult with zero discount offers. We tried to explain to the insectarium ticket people we only wished to walk the garden, but they said you must buy a ticket for the insect museum that is included with park entry. We felt like we wasted our money overall. We spent maybe 10 minutes in the insectarium and 20 minutes in the gardens because it was boring, underwhelming, and just not set up very well to guide you point to point. The park looked nothing like past visitors' photos.

Admission was $15/person but worth every dime and the Metro will dump you within walking distance.We had a difficult time finding the ""Garden of Lights"" within the Botanical Garden because of the French language barrier and probably because some of the Canadians behave like rude French folks.  (Yes I said, ""French"" and ""folks"" in the same phrase).  But once we got our bearings (and Hubby peed behind a tree--it was THAT dark) we were off on an amazing path to loveliness. At one point, we were all lost from each other due to the crowd of people and children in strollers (they should really have an adult only night.)

One setback from all this? The rates! They differer from children to senior, or from Quebec resident to non-residents. Having said this.

There's A LOT of walking going on- Bring water and snacks. They don't check your bag- Get a map before you enterThis is probably one of the biggest botanical garden I've been to. It is huge so I guess for the price you paid, it's worth it to check out. It's probably as big as Huntington Park or even bigger in California but with more stuff to check out. I like how each section has a theme to it so whatever you don't like, you can easily skip through it. It's been awhile but what stood out the most to me was Chinese & Japanese Garden.

64,"Forget everything that you've known about visiting a botanical garden. The visit alone will change your experience and knowledge of plants and flowers. The ticket price is worth every cent from the beautiful sculptors and displays in addition to the lovely exhibits and attractions that the garden covers. Unfortunately, Hub and I were not able to visit and cover every section of the garden since we did all the attractions on the same day. We skipped the Tree House and Leslie-Hancock Garden and the Youth Gardens that was located all the way at the end of the museum. The botanical garden would take at least 3 hours to cover the entire premise for your visit. For those who need more time to venture and explore, no worries the admission is good for 2 days. Our fav area is definitely the popular Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The layout of the landscape design is literally covered in blooms, pavilion, and waterfalls. In terms of variation, the Chinese garden is known for the architecture and history of the Dynasty while the Japanese garden is known for combining all elements of the garden to create art and zen state of mind. As for the horticulturist-artists work, all of the mosaics were breathtaking. However, the work of the Mother Earth is a stunning and unforgettable creation. I can't even begin to describe the striking visual of the intricate shape of the hands opening up a waterfall and the other hand to a deer. Just by a glance tells you, not only does the sculpture look tedious but it definitely took hours of labor and toll to complete the piece of art.  And, you get to vote on your favorite work/sculpture at the International Hub to win a trip for 2 to Doha, Qatar until the end of this year.  For those who are into the whole garden scenery, the Insectarium might be more of your cup of tea. There are numerous collections and exhibits on the diverse insects. There's even a live demonstration for those brave enough to hold a scorpion. The leafcutter ants are pretty amazing. Each ant picks and cuts leafs to feed and harvest fungus where they feed and maintain their nest and defend their colony. Have fun on your visit.

When I went, in mid-April, it was still quite cold and the garden wasn't even charging admission in the outer exhibits. The feature was pretty much just the insectarium and the butterflies. I mean...the former was kinda good (but very small) and the latter could've been experienced for free at Changi airport in Singapore. Sure, there were a lot of butterflies, but it was kind of overkill. The line to see them was way too long and it was a bit underwhelming.

73,"I was expecting more. The Chinese garden as others mentioned is the high light. We went during the day, not for the light show at night. The first national garden section is kind of awful to look at and is a let down. I was expecting to see manicured and well cared for flowers arranged in beautiful settings and grouped by colors into amazing designs. No. Just some flower groupings with some flower species not doing all that great in early September. The shade garden was in better shape than the flowers that lead into the Chinese garden. Did not have time for the green houses but also was just so over the underwhelming experience and already tired from walking without much reward that we were ready to go.

74,My favorite exhibit was the Chinese exhibit. I loved all the lighted displays and the lilly pond and architecture.  The food at the deli was JUST OK.I wished it was more organized. I really wanted to grab a drink at the restaurant but there was an opera going on and there was a long line at 5 PM and they close at 6 PM.  I would recommend bringing water because the walk from the train station or the biodome is uphill and a bit of a walk for a hot summer day.  It was nice to stroll around the park.  There were a few wedding photographer and parties there.  The exits and entries are very confusing.,4,9/14/2015,Kim S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LfKztiKBS2P2_QoNeilWeQ,"Lowell, MA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
75,You could make a whole day out of this which is awesome. Beautiful gardens and I almost died when I got to the Chinese garden. When I walked through the wall I thought I had instantly had been transported to China. Keep note they have different things going on in the teahouse so maybe plan your visit around an event as I missed one I would've enjoyed. We sat down in the teahouse and was shown how to do tea and had cookies with it for $10 and well worth it. Japanese garden had a house full of kimono and impressive bonsai as well as many friendly Koi in the pond.

76,"If you are a tourist from out of town, the admission comes out to be about $19.00 per person with tax. A ticket gives you access to the Insectarium de Montreal and the train and shuttles that go throughout the garden. Here are some quick tips when coming here for a day trip:- Parking: If you want to park on the premises, it is $12 for the entire day. We are out of towners and didn't want to deal with trying to find street parking. You can park here and walk to the BioDome to save some money.- Gardens: There are a wide variety of gardens to go to. The China Garden, Japanese Garden, and Rose Garden. They even had a Natives Garden which was pretty unique. My only gripe is that the flowers were not exactly in bloom in the month of August. Most of the living things that we saw were plants. Even the rose garden was pretty sparse. Upkeep of the Chinese and Japanese structures were also pretty limited. The Chinese structures had cobwebs and didn't look well maintained.- Asian Friendly: I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I feel that my parents got a really good kick out of the gardens - mainly because they were able to reminisce on good times in Asia when walking through the Chinese gardens. They even have tea where you can sit on the porch of the gardens, drink tea, and chat as you look out into the koi pond area. The signs say not to feed the Koi fishes but the Koi fishes follow you around, which shows me that people do it anyway.- Mini Train: For those who can't walk very far, there is a mini train that takes you on a 15 minute tour of the entire garden area. There is also a free shuttle that takes you to different stops throughout the gardens.Bottom Line: A little expensive and not as well maintained as I thought it would be. It is definitely lower on the list of things to see in Montreal.",3,8/4/2014,Ivy T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G89MgEpjVkawmL1cMdM66w,"Garden Grove, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

79,"I have been coming to Botanical Garden for years, and it is a place filled of plenty of great memories that happen in different seasons and different periods of my life. The most recent visit is to come to see the tulip festival, since I won't be able to make it for the one in Ottawa, but honestly the one in Montreal really stunned me! It was splendid and the way how the tulips are planted is so different from the way how they arrange the tulips in Ottawa, which makes the Montreal tulip festival super cool and mesmerizing! In spring, we can see a lot of cherry blossom, lilac, peony, and so on in the garden; in summer, roses, lotus, hydrangeas, lilies are in full bloom; in fall, the magical lantern festival in the Chinese garden also amaze visitors, and even in winter, the Christmas garden sparkles and dazzles.

80,"Beautiful place to spend a day. On the expensive side, especially for non-Quebec residents. If you're a Montrealer, they have an Early Bird Card that costs $8 (!) that grants you access for ONE YEAR to the grounds between 6 and 9 AM. Great for runners and/or people who live in the area.The gardens are organized by type (e.g., rose, shrub, etc.), function (e.g., medicinal, edible, toxic), and theme (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Native). The gardens and paths are well maintained and there are lots of labels to tell you what's what. About half of the grounds (towards Rosemont) comprise the arboretum. A few notes about specific gardens... The Chinese gardens were undergoing renovations when we went, so the buildings were closed, but the gardens were otherwise open. There was a lot of construction fencing as well, which detracted from the garden's serenity, but it was still quite nice. There was a special exhibition at the Japanese gardens that featured some stunning works of art from survivors of Hiroshima. I would highly recommend spending some time there.They have a lantern festival every autumn, which I hear is quite spectacular.",4,7/26/2015,Carolyn T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5i8f_qKmYjBuRODEa_XQMw,"Toronto, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
81,"This place is full of people, but I can see why. Unlike many touristy spots, the Botanical Garden is full of rich cultural sections that not only have unique plants and information in a vast park - but very unique and well-planned architecture that makes you feel like you're engulfed in a completely different place.The Chinese garden is probably the most impressive. On the day that we went, we saw two separate wedding photo shoots on location, along with a mix of several park visitors that were soaking up the views.The Japanese garden and the greenhouse are two other locations that I would recommend visiting. The greenhouse has several different segments that have plants from tropical locations to the desert (you will feel the climate variances as you walk through each electric door opening).Do yourself a favor and visit this place - you will definitely find satisfaction.",4,6/23/2015,Landon C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=b5nItcKLY0URubUWERZjcA,"Boston, MA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

85,We came here the weekend of April 23 2016. The dumb thing was we had purchased the tickets for both Bio Dome & Botanical Garden (Individual tickets $19 or $34 for both) at the same time. Turns out no one was checking for tickets when we arrived at the garden. Mostly because nothing had bloomed yet. It will be so beautiful in the warm summer months (late May to early Sept). The garden is absolutely serene and stunning even though nothing was out yet. My favourite was likely the Chinese garden. They finally scanned our tickets when we got inside the building to look at the green house plants. The area was a little tight and those who do not have the courtesy to move over to the side while admiring the plants held up the line. That was my major pet peeve. Loved the butterfly garden.,4,4/26/2016,Rana L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P2E31XC7SP4v_3hXC2o0Xw,"Aurora, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
86,We wanted to do something besides walking around in the city so we went here. It's big to cross from one place to the next. I think my favorite part was the Asian gardens and the insect place. The insects there were so different granted I've seen  these bug on tv but to see them in real life was different. Great most the the bug display are dead so nothing is going jump at you. It was the coolest part of the garden. I took the path to the right of the purchase booth but I wish I went right because they have a trolly that can drop you to different parts of the park so you would have to walk so far from one place to the next,4,7/7/2018,Kim N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=e5MQZxFopYHuQGBXpg6isA,"Oklahoma City, OK",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

89,"Lucked out with good weather ! Got off of train at station PIE- IX. Walked right up the hill one block. Huge amount of construction going on but there was police to redirect. The Olympique Stadium was on the opposite side of the road from the Jardin de Botanique. We took some pics along the way. Can't miss the entrance to Jardin de Botanique and there's a huge parking lot. There's information booths with a friendly receptionist that speaks both English and French. Multiple passes to choose from with different rates. If you are a student or resident - you get a discount. We chose Tix 1 where we got the Jardins and Insectorium. Right at the entrance there's a Boutique to buy garden stuff :). You walk in at hit the green houses and Bioderm area. Once again everything was English / French and staff were extremely friendly. We got there about Lunch time so before we ventured to through the gardens we decided to go for lunch at their restaurant. Pricey but did not disappoint. We had fresh roast chicken, salad and brown rice- with a glass of wine. Most people were just enjoying a small pastry and coffee - visiting and reading on their own. We then walked around - first garden the restaurant had a terrace - great for snapping shots. However that was the first one! So be prepared to do a lot of walking. You do have the option to trolley to the end and it's quite the distance so ask about it at the ticket area. There's specific stops and they don't do random stops. Insectorium is a small bug museum - if u like bugs. This place was catering to parties, museums and they do evening festivities. Look it up before you go. Take some bug spray and sunscreen. Also it was unfortunate the Chinese garden was closed and some of the flowers yet to bloom.

It's a great place to bring the family and enjoy a leisurely stroll through nature and learn about nature. The insectarium is both fun and a bit creepy but it was great learning about the different types of bugs. The Jardin has a beautiful Chinese garden and has spots for both medicinal and toxic plants. On Saturday they have great activities such as taking part in a tea party. Would recommend to any enthusiast! They gave plenty of cafes and bathrooms too!

98,"My favorite botanical garden is in San Francisco, when you wander down into the wood, surrounded by redwoods and a creek, with nary a city sound whispering through the pines. But this is a close second. To me, a botanical garden is an escape from the city. I'm not really a plant person, despite my love of the botanical garden, but I love the opportunity to wander into my own quiet, and to have a nice view while I do so. This garden did not disappoint. The Chinese garden is a superb example, calming, and almost like I was transported miles and miles east. And its examples of bonzai were phenomenal. Not only did I learn a ton about the work that goes into bonzai, but I simply have to respect a 270 tree that is smaller than a toddler.I also fell in love with the English vertical crevasse garden. Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously some people, but not me. And now I want one. Thanks a lot, Jardin botanique.When I'm back in Montreal I'll definitely visit again.

99,"Hands down my favorite botanical garden and I've visited every one I have been able to wherever I travel. You have to spend time in the Japanese Gardens -- beautiful! I spent at least 2 hours in the gardens and saw maybe 25% of them. I will definitely visit this again and will set aside at least 4+ hours to walk through. The insectarium is small and has a couple really cool parts -- one being the ant farm. The ant farm shows ants taking food to their habitat -- you can see the ants carrying the pieces of food back and forth. Highly worth a visit (See my Insectarium review for more information).If you come to Montreal (or live in Montreal), this is a must see! Try to make it a cooler day if possible, otherwise wear very comfortable and cool clothes. Although I had the Montreal museum pass (well worth it if you plan on visiting multiple museums), I believe the Insectarium is part of the cost for the Botanical Gardens as the Insectarium is within the gardens.The Gardens are in the same area of the Olympic Stadium, Planetarium, Biodome, and a couple other activities.

Yes, the Chinese Garden won't reopen until 2017, but the Japanese Garden is worth spending some contemplative time in.

If you have trouble walking, please take the mini train! If you're just parking at the Biodome, then it will be a slightly closer walk because the garage is a little closer. The admission for 2 adults was about $40, which we thought was quite high just to view gardens. We are from Boston and our Arboretum is completely free. We visited in August (with what seemed like half the world), and hardly any flowers were in bloom. The green plants were there, but you can only look at so much greenery before you're bored.The best part, in my opinion, were the structures of China in the Chinese garden and the animals sculptures throughout the park.

The Chinese garden with all the bonsai trees was spectacular.Not very expensive and we found a 2 for 1 coupon which made it even cheaper.

115,"This review is based on my visit in fall when most of the plants were in hibernation and my personal views as an adult visitor.  I would rate this 4 stars if I took children here.My friend and I visited the Jardin Botanique during the 2015 lantern festival. Most of the shrubbery had gone into hibernation due to the cool weather. I think this is why the Jardin Botanique holds the lantern festival.We were excited to here about the Chinese/Japanese lantern festival. Even though a lot of effort went into putting it together (it's a 1-year process), we thought the displays and the lights were tacky. Many other adults and all of the children loved the display.  What can I say? My friend and I are jaded and have travelled internationally and prefer the real thing.There was a good demonstration of chinese shadow puppetry and the person who talked about it was very knowledgeable.  I would rate that part of the visit 5 stars.I enjoyed looking at the bonsai trees in the Japanese Garden. For some reason, I thought there would be many more bonsais than what I saw there. I found the Japanese Garden to be my favorite part of the gardens in the month of October given that many garden plants go into hibernation when autumn hits Montreal.If I had children, I would rate this as 4-stars. If you're not a child, it's not necessary to visit this attraction if you're short on time and can occupy yourself with other things to do. This attraction was relatively easy to get to using public transit as it is very close to the subway/metro.",2,1/1/2016,Geeta S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ykcYfhzoSEAwrjoMr5hctQ,"San Francisco, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

123,$18.50 for adults/$14 for students for both the garden and insectariumI was here 2nd week of May 2014. The place is massive. The Chinese garden was lovely and way prettier than the Japanese garden. The Japanese garden seems like a good place for a picnic. There was a Japanese show/performance when we visited on a Sunday afternoon. The flowers weren't in full bloom though so that was quite disappointing.

124,"I visited the Montréal Botanical Garden during the beginning/warm part of fall. On its 75 hectares, it features numerous distinct gardens. Some of my favorite gardens were the arid/desert, Chinese, and Japanese. I also really enjoyed the plants that were grown into the shapes of animals, such as a horse, duck, gorilla, and panda. The paths around the gardens were very crowded with people, so I had some difficulty with seeing around/over people and walking. Overall, this garden is huge and has many pretty plants to see.

Once we got there we realized that their grass is not taken care of whatsoever. There's a lot of weeds. That was the first thing we saw that was bothering. Botanical garden can't even take care of their grass?! Come on bro! Second, practically all the exhibitions were closed that day. We didn't even get a warning at the ticket booth/entrance. A lot of exhibitions were under renovation or just closed. Third, there was confusion getting back inside the greenhouse.

126,"This place is just fantastic.  I would come back here again on my next trip to Montreal.  A little pricey to get in ($29.50 for regular adult, $22.50 for student), but I was definitely oh-ing and ah-ing the whole way through.  But, I think a lot of this is due to the International Mosaicultures event that was exhibiting while I was there.  Of course, there were a ton of tourists and it was crowded as heck, but I guess if anything, it's just a validation of the fact that you probably came to the right place to sight-see.The jardin definitely seems huge and I didn't get to go through the whole place, but I would like to go back to do so and maybe see whatever new exhibits they have going on.  I will say that the bug exhibit is super awesome.  It's definitely a bit disgusting, but man, I never knew so many different kinds of amazing looking insects exist!  It's really extraordinary and I think that's the vibe of this whole place.  It makes you realize how beautiful our world is and how much we messed it all up.  It's awesome that a lot of the beauty that our world has to offer has been encapsulated and curated so that we could enjoy it for years to come.Now that I think about it, while the price is steep, it's more than worth it to take a peek at what our natural world looks like undisturbed.  Awesome.",5,11/6/2013,Paul L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nE3KdKDCFMYMiRHkr_l-hg,"Edgewater, NJ",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

129,"The Montreal botanical gardens are rapidly becoming one of my favorite places in the city to visit.   It's one part of the Montreal Space for Life which also includes the Biodome, Insectarium and the Planetarium. It's a 75 hectare National Historic Site of Canada and is considered one of the most important botanical gardens in the world.  Just a short walk from the Pie-IX metro station it's open year round. Containing 22,000 species spread throughout 10 greenhouses and 30 gardens many of which are located outside the place is huge. Montrealers can check out the outside stuff for free.There're special events and exhibitions all year and many of them are actually quite good.  Walk amongst thousands of butterflies in the ""Butterflies Go Free"" exhibit held annually  from February to April. Gardeners will be interested in the annual plant sale held in May. It's worth checking out their website to see all the stuff going on.Open all year, continually changing, educational and family friendly, the only real downside is that tickets can be steep.  Starting at $15 for Quebecers, special events sometimes cost a bit more. The gardens are big enough though that it will take hours to get through just a portion. The International Mosaicultures event currently on until the end of September 2013 runs $25 but the ticket is actually valid for two visits. Of course, the outside bits won't cost you a dime.It's a fun and educational outing that breaks up the monotony of city life and breaks you out of the rut of cocktails, live music, performance art hipster routine.",5,8/8/2013,Chris B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,"Montreal, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

They have free wifi near the ticket booths, so use your smart phone to go to their website to purchase tickets - it'll save you about 30 minutes in wait time! Then just show your phone when you go to walk in. Jardin Botanique accepts student ID's from the US so we were able to get  in at discounted rates.There are clean bathrooms and drinking fountains throughout many of the buildings within the gardens.

131,"What a beautiful garden. My husband and I decided  at Christmas last year that we were going to Montreal for a vacation. He also had a few surprises up his sleeve, tickets for arcade fire at parc jean drapeau. I'm such a lucky lady.    Anyhow, the afternoon of the concert we had a few hours to spare so we headed to the gardens for a lovely afternoon of sightseeing. The entrance fee was a bit steep, but if you have a AAA you will receive a discount. The ticket cost also included the insectarium, which I opted out of because I'm a wimp that does not care for insects.   The garden is massive, and features many different styles, even featuring desiduous plants native to my hubs home state of Colorado. I would have to say my favorite areas were the lake, the Asian gardens and the tree troll. The troll was a lot more difficult to find than I thought it would be. I wish we had more time to enjoy the park, maybe with a picnic of assorted french cheeses and a nice bottle of wine.    I hope to return in the future and spent more time in the park, it was so lovely and I will remember it until my dieing day. I only wish that I had been fortunate enough to see the temporary topiary show that was at the garden last summer, but all in all I was not disappointed.

Highly recommend if you are a nature lover. This is next to the Biodome as well - so why not kill 2 birds with one stone if you have the time.

133,"It is a true gem. I have been coming here since I was a baby and I just cannot get tired of it because they always update, change, add new features, and have special events on the regular basis (like the pumpkins for Halloween, the Chinese lanterns in the fall, the ice sculptures in the winter). If you live in Montreal and own an Accès Montreal card, you get in for free (and the card is just 8$, cheaper than a single ticket to get in). This summer, they had a rich series of concerts at various places around the garden on the weekends: Jazz, tango, classical, pop... Then you just have to sit back in the grass and relax while listening and enjoying the view. These were magic moments. Besides that, the food at the restaurant is very decent but it is on the longer side to wait in line (it is cafeteria style). That being said, when you go spend time there, it usually is because you are not in a rush and ready to take your time, so in that mindset, it is ok to wait. Little kids will enjoy the shuttle ride around the garden and the park near the insectarium. Parents will be happy to find a breastfeeding/ baby feeding/ diaper changing room in the main pavilion near the ticket booths, and changing stations in most bathrooms all around the garden.

139,"Decided to fork out the quite pricey admission fee to visit during the Mosaicultures International and the Garden of Lights. Both of these events are well worth seeing as they are very beautiful displays. The Mosaicultures which ends by the 29th of Sept is made up of about 40 sculptures made from plants basically. Some of them are huge and they are all amazing to view. The Bird Tree took them like 6 years to make, thats how much effort goes in to these. The Garden of Lights is an annual nightly event through the Fall where the Chinese Garden is filled with Lanterns of all different things from animals to warriors and the Japanese Gardens is also lit up. This is also very nice to see. Admission during this time allows you two visits if you were not visiting at a time to see them both or I just passed the ticket on to someone else.Admission also includes entry to the Insectarium which is interesting but didn't take me more than 30mins to explore. During the year when these events are not on, admission is cheaper but still a little expensive so you would really have to appreciate the gardens to pay the fee. The Gardens are quite big and you could spend a few hrs just wandering the paths all the way to the other end where the Tree House and arboretum is and the green houses are quite good.Overall, if you're going during these events be prepared for lots of people but otherwise pick a nice day and enjoy the gardens.",4,9/20/2013,Kylie P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=voDqNNoB-9KLlczLhRqStA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

The Japanese and Chinese gardens here were highly impressive - you almost feel like you're walking through an Asian festival with all of the lanterns and artwork!

The park is huge and it has indoor greenhouse gardens that are loaded with beautiful flowers. The BF is a bit of a queer *cough* I mean gardener, so he was pointing out the flowers by all their Latin names and throwing random factoids at me about what makes each plant so special which was like being back in biology 101. Annuals, semi-annuals, bulbs... I don't care as long as they look pretty! On special occasions I am required to buy him flowers! How does that work?! If you have the time, you should definitely check out the Jardin Botanique de Montreal.

There was literally every kind of food that comes from the ground being grown there: vegetables, herbs, fruits... we were tempted to swipe an onion to include with our dinner feast later that night but there are signs all over telling us that they take vegetable theft very seriously so we ended up not doing it.

Of course, I am a kid at heart and ran through myself.The rating lacks 2 stars because I was a little mislead about the Chinese Lanterns.  One the website and the brochure, it mentions ""The Lanterns in Music"".  When reading that, I expected to see was the story of the Emperor (the theme this year) told to music....instead, after waiting around for 45 minutes, we found out that it was just music in one of the little areas....NOTHING to do with the actual lanterns.

162,"4.5 stars!Second time coming here. The first time was in March and the weather was too cold for the outside gardens. We had an amazing time exploring the different plants and flowers indoors, as well as attending the ""Butterflies Go Free"" events, it was crowded (long line) but worth the wait. The butterflies were beautiful are released in the greenhouse and would sometimes land on your clothes. Second visit was this past weekend (mid of July), we mainly visited the gardens outside and the Insectarium (which was closed for renovation the last time we came). It's rose season and it's absolutely gorgeous in the gardens, all types of flowers were blossoming. The gardens all have their little theme - Rose garden, Chinese garden, Japanese garden, Alphine garden, First nations garden. It's a great relaxing hike in the Arboretum area when not too hot and plenty of people relaxes on the grass next to the water and otherwise. It's quite stunning and you really could spend many hours here exploring the different types of flora and plants. The Insectarium is relatively small, but fun, I got to hold an insect resembling a leaf (harmless) while the staff taught us interesting facts. The beef hive (clear glass) was very interesting as well. They also have a wall calendar in the front lobby where they indicate the types of plants and flowers blossoming for each month. A combination of ticket is offered with Insectarium, Biodome (also quite special) and the Olympic tower.

168,I adored these gardens!! This year (2013) is the mosaicultures internationales montreal (MIM) - basically the Olympics of gardening. This only happens every four years and each time in a different country so if you ever want to go to the gardens it should be now! The gardens from each country were very beautiful and full of meaning... we had a guide (can get a free guide in the morning) but the plaques near each garden tell the stories of each garden well. It is more busy on the weekend so go on the weekday if you can and either go early or in the later afternoon. Also - your entry fee gets you into the insectarium which you can visit on a separate day - my 2.5 yr old nephew really loved both the gardens and the insectarium so it was well worth it! Also - cheaper if you have an access montreal pass (need to be a MTL resident) or if you are a student.,5,7/8/2013,Corinne R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Mt7q9U48KiAJKivYRB5vog,"Montreal, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

Once inside the garden, it was very hard to walk around and enjoy the works of art when there were so many people (there was literally no elbow room). They were beautiful works, though. For this particular day's experience, I would give it 3 stars, but I know that in essence, the garden deserves more respect. We saw half of the Mosaicultures works because the crowds tired us out, and did not get to see the Gardens of Light exhibit due to fatigue (it would've been nicer to view after dusk, anyway).

They should get some temporary cashiers for really busy times when they know they are going to be slammed.",1,10/14/2008,Heather S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OVybYv9Ony6z276wn13pcw,"Atlanta, GA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
190,"I actually really liked this attraction! Definitely worth the money (though it wasn't cheap. Approximately $20 a person plus $12 for all day parking --- but they offer a CAA discount so ask about that if you have CAA membership). Beautifully maintained, open, clean, signage EVERYWHERE so you cannot get lost... there are activities for the young and old. Free trolleys that will shuttle you from one end of the park to the other if it's too far of a walk. Plants of every type and variety... I particularly enjoyed the edible and poisonous plants, and the insectarium was included with our admission. There are some disgusting bugs out there, but fantastic to view. You can tell they invested a lot of money into the park. We went earlier in the morning so it wasn't busy, by the time we left there was a long line to get in... by then it was quite hot so I would recommend going earlier to avoid lines/busy crowds/heat. Will go again! Beautiful.",5,7/25/2015,Nicole Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Pob1hwN01ESGYnzoMmsiKg,"Burnaby, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
191,"a beautiful place to stroll around for a few hours and soak in all the nature around you. i couldn't stop taking pictures of all the scenery! the chinese and japanese gardens were really nicely done, and my mother couldn't stop raving about how accurate they were (she's asian and a perfectionist). it's a great place to go, and it'll make you love montreal even more!",5,7/19/2012,Michelle M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nX0l1tTTA8_lA6okJSOO9w,"New York, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
192,"this place really disappointed me and my fiancee.. sure we came at the beginning of autumn.. but the gardens itself really left us wanting more since it was devoid of ""pretty flowers"".. the chinese gardens with the lanterns was nice though.. nevertheless.. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone",2,9/28/2011,Stan L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rW-iz5OKzzp2WOHh-CC9uQ,"Seattle, WA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
193,"We visited the special exhibit - at first we were doubting paying $30 each (though good for two entries, we only had time for one) to walk through gardens, no matter how pretty - SO glad we did! Unbelievable topiaries in the special exhibit, and I mean unbelievably big, varied, historical, unbelievably creative and beautiful. They are sponsored by various associations within Canada and by other countries. The Chinese garden especially was also beautiful, peaceful, and interesting. Beautiful bonsai in the Japanese garden (and in the Chinese, but called something different there). We easily spent several hours walking the circuit. Many people seemed to be picnicking. If you are into gardening there is much more to explore. They have a garden devoted to vegetables, an alpine garden, and one devoted to new plants on the commercial home market. You can combine entries to the Biodome, Olympic Tower, and/or Insectarium - look online to figure it out before you wait on line, and in fact buy your tickets ahead of time so you don't need to wait (though the line moved okay, for us). We didn't have time for add-ons (but Biodome sounded great).",5,6/26/2013,Lisa G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=C2BFqOa0BErC2246cvli2A,"Andover, MA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
194,"a sprawling garden with over 20,000 plants--check out the space-age ""Big O"" (""Big Owe""), Olympic Stadium, as well as the rest of the futuristic 1976 Olympics complex, while you're in the vicinity",4,4/26/2011,Anthony K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,"Montreal, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
