I first noticed the amazing structures which looked like trees, you can climb on them and get a different perspective of the neighborhood.  Then as I kept on walking along the long path, I've noticed the play area for kids as well as a few coworkers (I guess) enjoying a game of ping pong on the permanent tables, there's also a trek fit space for outdoor training, lounge chairs as well as picnic tables and at the end, the amazing sculpture, Source, which was created for Montréal's 375th anniversary.Although I enjoyed my walk, I must say that as this park is replacing a former expressway, I could not avoid the car waltz and all that it implies, moreover, the trees of the Promenade Bonaventure being very young, it was impossible to find a point of shade by this sunny day.",4,9/20/2017,Cindy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,"Montreal, Canada",Entrée de Ville Bonaventure
