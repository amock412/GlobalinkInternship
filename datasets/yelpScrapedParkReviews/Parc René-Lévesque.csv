0,"This is one of my favourite spots in the greater Montreal area. What a treasure! On a nice Fall, Spring, or Summer day... it is paradise. I live in Pointe-Saint-Charles and love waking up early (6am) to bike along the Canal Lachine until I reach this destination. For me, the best feeling is arriving in the empty park and joining the birds as they do their morning chirping thing. What a privilege!! I always stop at the West-most point of the park to sit on a park bench, eat a banana, and watch the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. On a calm, quiet, and clear morning this is perfection. I usually take the opportunity to think about something while I do this and then often feel the need to get back on the move after 10-15 minutes (so I'm still waiting for my epiphany of thought during these sessions). Anyway, my real point is this: Parc Rene-Levesque is a wonderful investment of time into happiness. A little time (10-15 minutes) really helps me win my day. I am so grateful that we all have access to this precious public resource.To give a sense of proportion: Lachine is on of the very few areas outside of my beloved Pointe-Saint-Charles neighbourhood that I've thought of moving to. This park is a main driver of this consideration.",5,11/14/2020,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
1,"I have very mixed feelings about this place. Let me explain.The park is massive. No complaints here. Tons of room to walk, rest and have a nice picnic. You'll find, along the way, nice sculptures representing different things. Along the way is a nice dock you can walk on and be close to the water on the Canal. This good stuff pretty much stops here. The park, and I mean all of it (look on google maps for the entire size), is filled with dog poop. I mean everywhere. Take one step and you've stepped in some, take another step and... low and behold you've stepped in some more again.I am not kidding. The park is not clean and I was disgusted by this that I did not want to sit on the ground to have my picnic. Thank god we found a bench because there was absolutely no way I'd be able to sit and eat.My reasoning for the two stars is that if you expect people to come to a public park, at least clean it.I understand if there was dog poop here and there but literally everywhere? I mean c'mon Parc René-Lévesque. Time to step up and clean the poopsies!",2,10/7/2020,Andrew H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kjzg7jTm6tWhETeJ3xDqZw,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
2,A really nice park to walk through with a gorgeous view of the water. One of the more scenic parks around Montreal at the tip of the Lachine Canal.,5,11/24/2020,Jonathan L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ykuDGEj5J1PKs-0huwiVVg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
3,"Park René-Lévesque is simply gorgeous. It's basically a strip of land that stretches right into Saint Lawrence river and lake Saint Luis. The views of the surrounding water are breathtaking in all seasons particularly from the west tip of the park. Big highlight of the park is the sculpture garden. There is also an arboretum section to enjoy. Best of all is the park is accessible by many biking paths. However if you prefer to come for a picnic with many friends, family, bringing cooler and barbecue grill you will find a lot of paid parking space at the park entrance. One of the places I would also strongly recommend to bring Montreal visitors to.",5,9/20/2020,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
4,"Please don't hate me because I'm from Montreal, live downtown, am an avid biker and never knew about this Park. I discovered  it today and what a Gem this is. It's what we call a Peninsula in Lachine. On one side we see all the boats and on the other the horizon. I fumbled on to this riding through Verdun to Lasalle to Lachine. It's a small stretch through the park about 300m but it's full of families playing, outdoor beautiful sculptures or benches to sit on and just take a deep breath and look out in the yonder..... What a great day it was!",5,8/23/2019,Karen H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
5,"It astounds me that there are people in Montreal who have lived here for years and have no idea or clue about Montreal's southern shoreline and how it's basically one long, 20 km non-stop park (and bicycle path) from the Champlain Bridge right through Verdun, Lasalle and to the end of Lachine/beginning of Dorval. (Seriously Plateau yuppies and Mile End hipsters, get out of your shells sometime...) Parc Rene Levesque is one of the more special ones, in that it is a peninsula created from landfill (like  Ile Ste-Helene and Parc Jean Drapeau), but the landscape artists did a super job making the sculptures and the waterfront views the highlights of this peninsula park. On one side, it faces Kahnawake and on the other side, it faces the old Lachine village, the Lachine marina and the beginning of the Lachine Canal. This place is always filled with roller-bladers, cyclists and families out enjoying the day. Not sure if it's still going, but there used to be a ferry that ran between the tip of the park to the Lachine Village (in front of the Dairy Queen).I find Montreal, while it has its share of sculptured public art, comes no where near as close the amounts of public sculptures and statues you see in cities like New York, Toronto or even Chicago. Come here, and it makes up for what it lacks downtown if you like sculptured art. In fact all the waterfront parks along Lachine are full of them.",5,7/4/2018,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
6,"HIDDEN MONTREAL PARK GEM and next to Mont-Royal our favorite number 2 park for walking, skating, runninh or biking.Park shoots out on a peninsula with water on both sides and one of the largest outdoor sculpture exhibits in canada and beautifully kept large green lawn areas and waterside recliners and benches.Park is not huge but it is a great peaceful, breezy and well maintained setting for a nice walk and picnic and a great bench seating area at the end of the peninsula with the cool water breezes and water all around.At the beginning of the park on right side you will find a sign with map and list of the 30 outdoor sculptures and their artists. Before you read the artists background and description try to get the group to determine what they thought the artist inspiration or influences were in making these sculptures.There is also a great cafe bistro with lots of seating area and terrace at the start of the park.A must stop for all: locals and visitors",5,5/21/2018,A A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-Yb1srF4RYtpn-6Yp8ojRg,"New York, NY",Parc René-Lévesque
7,This is a medium size park (I would say a strip of 2 Km on 200-300m) but full of wonders. The park is a small Peninsula which means you can walk on the trail and on one side see boats and the other the horizon. At the entrance there is a small shop you can rent bikes or skates or just buy some icecream. This is your last chance for some cold drinks if you didnt bring any with you.What gives this park some extra points is all the wonderful statues that are scattered all over. My son just loved exploring them. Most of the park is exposed to the sun but there are trees and benches you can sit on or picnic in the shade. also in the edge of the park there is a small strip you can actually go into the water (if you are brave).,4,6/27/2016,Tomer N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,"Ottawa, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
8,"GORGEOUS park. One of my favorite parks, if not my favorite. Such an easy park to stroll through as it is spread along the water. Unlike other parks, there are no cliffs to hike up and it probably holds the most outdoor sculptures. Just wish it was closer to my place downtown. FYI, no dogs allowed. Having traveled all the way there, I was lucky to have a carrier bag for my little furry friend to carry him around unnoticed. - The end.",5,6/28/2017,Tania P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BxOG479iEleffbKoR_X3Mg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
9,"Absolutely LOVED this parc. It's soo beautiful. It's the end of the Canal Lachine Bike route. and there's so many birds/ducks that don't get scared of you, places to sit, restrooms if you need it, and just an amazing view. It's really good to relax, have your picnic, enjoy ypur food, chill, tan, anything basically! I'd come back here again, and it's a nice break after the long long bike ride!",5,7/23/2015,Lara S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RMopAcH2eoiOuPkStfg_YQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc René-Lévesque
