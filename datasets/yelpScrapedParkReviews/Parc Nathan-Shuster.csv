0,"Well this is not the traditional children's playground that our little one normally goes to.  Out of all the playground we have been to, this one is undeniably the coolest. We went early in the morning, but can assure you that this place gets busy very fast. The principal attraction is the zipline, which makes this park truly unique.  Make your way to the treehouse, going on the suspended bridges, spider webs and ladders. Lots of other features to ensure that kids of all ages will not get bored, and plenty of places to sit or even have a bite to eat. Very well designed and plenty of space. Just be mindful to stay off areas where there are warning signs about poison ivy.",5,8/11/2019,Sylvio L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3TQ356XWIEM7DDiiRhMt1w,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Nathan-Shuster
