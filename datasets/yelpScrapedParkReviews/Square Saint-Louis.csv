1,"We happened on this stunning outdoor space walking from the metro to our chocolate restaurant. Pictures do not do it justice.I am a sucker for squares, and have always wanted to live on or near one.  The homes in this area are beautiful.  Folks were sitting and reading, laying on blankets, and picnicking on this warm summer day.Idyllic....except maybe the man urinating on one of the porches....a bit TMI!

2,Carre St Louis or Square St Louis is my favourite park in Montreal.  In any of the three seasons (minus winter as I never come here in the cold) it's absolutely idyllic!  It's Montreal's version of Bryant Square park but much nicer!  There is a very cool fountain in the middle and majestic old trees that provide shade and allow for cover from the sun! The houses that line the park speak to the old world architechtue that is quite prevalent and well kept in Montreal.  I imagine in my mind many poets and artists living here but rather it's probably urban professionals.    Unfortunately there are many sketchy characters (some homeless) and young individuals partaking in a toke of weed/pot or drink in the park which is rather unfortunate.  It would be nicer (and safer feeling) without the seedy people.  The pot people don't bother me it's the other individuals.  However if you don't make eye contact they pretty much stay to themselves!  This would make it a 5/5 for me if it was cleaned up but for some this is probably their home!  I'd let my daughter roam freely if different however I keep her close by.  Come stroll on a wonderful blue sky day or come as the leaves change  Open your imagination and relax as you stroll through!,4,9/27/2014,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
3,"Wonderful and quaint little park with beautiful Victorian style homes surrounding it that look like something out of a Disney fairytale. Many look old and somewhat like a castle. So very cool.Lush foliage, green grass, flowers, benches, and walkways thoughout. A commom area centered by a fountain and statue.The neighborhood that surrounds it features beautiful homes and residential structures.This park is a locals haven to relax and enjoy the fresh air. There is also seating along the outside on the sidewalks. If I lived here I would be at this park a lot. Still, as clean as this park is I still don't understand the graffiti painted or scratched onto some of the structures such as the fountain. What is wrong with people who do that?As it was we were only able to visit a few times while walking over to St Denis street, and take a few moments to sit on a bench to rest our feet. The locals are lucky to have a nice place like this close to where they live.",4,7/19/2016,Phil H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,"New York, NY",Square Saint-Louis
4,"The Victorian chic of the streets & houses around Square Saint-Louis...They stand in the same line as San Francisco Painted Ladies. Emanating same charm as Punta Arena's Plaza Muñoz Gamero.Reminiscent in feel of open courtyards along Sienna river....You will hear your heart sing when you see colorful rooftops surrounding this square.Shades of the tall trees, urban sculptures dotted throughout park alleys, wooden benches warmed by the sun, and narrow streets around it - a symphony of colors and architecture.I spend quiet hours in the morning enjoying little warmth of winter sun, and long hours in many afternoons, walking streets around it with my little camera in hand.It is beautiful and peaceful. A retreat, a rest stop, an eye candy.A place to see, a place to remember.",5,2/4/2015,Nadia Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=c3xkFRo38JB7T0xgiPOEbw,"Staten Island, NY",Square Saint-Louis
5,"Perfect little park and resting spot in the heart of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal surrounded by stately Victorian homes with beautiful, even whimsical features that evoke a sense of joie de vivre.",5,3/5/2018,Peter A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZDJMtb0kxIdypDuizEwfpQ,"Falls Church City, Falls Church, VA",Square Saint-Louis
6,"St. Louis Square is one of those special places that makes Montreal a great city.Surrounded on three sides by beautiful homes and on the fourth by Rue St. Denis, this square is a beautiful urban oasis cloaked in bustle and green in the summer, yet perhaps more striking in the winter when the branches of its year-round residents hold snow and stillness equally.",5,2/3/2014,Brandon C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Toronto, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
7,"A cute, quaint park with absolutely beautiful homes surrounding it. The houses have such colourful rooftops and all their decorations/style are so unique!  Since the weather was super nice when I visited, there were plenty of people laying on the grass, kids and parents having fun with the fountain and pinicking. The square itself isn't that big, but there's plenty of grassy space and also enough paths to walk through, that you definitely won't need to tread through any grassy areas.",4,6/2/2016,Alina M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,"Markham, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
8,Great park - we could sit and watch these silly squirrels play for hours.  Seriously the most hilarious squirrels I have ever encountered.We had coffee at the little cafe one morning and it was so relaxing to sit in this park and people watch.We came here twice during our 4 day stay - so glad we happened upon this park!,5,9/6/2016,Lauren A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3ZLaWq1ESGsxc8M6e4rH-g,"Holyoke, MA",Square Saint-Louis
9,"Carre St-Louis is a wonderful pocket park in a neighborhood of Victorian homes.  It preserves the essence of the time it was designed and is an integral part of what makes Montreal a captivating city to visit or inhabit.  If comparisons are possible, Fitler Square in Philadelphia and Gramercy Park in New York offer a similar sentimentality. The area is worth a long stroll and bench sitting.  A pedestrian walk sits to the west of the Square.  It is lined with restaurants and cafes, many outdoors.  There is a central structure in the Square that has been converted into a small café.  Tables and chairs await you.  On the morning we were there, two guitarists were practicing something new and working out the kinks in their harmonies. Great free entertainment. To be complete, there are also homeless and questionable characters hanging out, but they kept to themselves for the most part.  It pays to be a little careful and aware while enjoying yourselves. But, it is their Carre, too.",5,7/17/2013,Gerald S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw,"Newtown, PA",Square Saint-Louis
10,Nice restful park with massive maple trees that provide shade.  Has a small concession in the middle.  Restaurants nearby in a side street.  Has a central fountain area.,5,5/28/2017,Paul G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Gv2wHeY8sQuyEUS8yX56HA,"Edmonton, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
11,"Just a sweet little square at the end of the cobblestones, not a park in the sense of swings and sandboxes, just a lovely little green spot. Carré St Louis is one pretty layered fountain with rings of benches around it, a café only open in the summer for selling ice cream and lattés, typical bright Montreal architecture facing the square where a mix of students and great Quebec artists and playwrights make their homes. There is some romance in the air here that must explain all our 5 star reviews... this may also explain why I have hazy memories of splashing through said fountain in summer dress and sandals some summer night another lifetime ago...",5,2/14/2012,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
12,"What a great little park in Montreal. It reminds me of NYC, Washington Square park. Surrounded by beautiful brownstones and it's very quiet. Just a block over you're right by several restaurants. I haven't seen any homeless people while walking though but I wouldn't be surprised if some were here in the evening. Montreal is a beautiful city but lots of homeless people.",5,10/20/2014,Amador A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1FAKs3CAQQLBgdB23GeDIQ,"Queens, NY",Square Saint-Louis
13,"One of my favorite little parks in Montreal, I always look forward to a stop there on my way to St. Laurent from the Sherbrooke Metro Station. I have seen this place in all four seasons and each season has a charm all its own. In the summertime St-Louis is at its most lively, yet the fall foliage can be breath takingly beautiful, the winter time covered in snow it is solitary, regal and majestic. There are lovely old multi colored houses/apartment buildings that border the park that are a photo op any time of year and are quite splendid in their use of color. There are benches surrounding the fountain in the center of the park which invite a moments stop to sit, reflect and view the surrounding beauty from within this little oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Montreal.",5,10/31/2014,Don P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,"Hampden County, MA",Square Saint-Louis
14,"Small little cute beautiful park.  Everybody who have ever checked ""Montreal"", you guys already know this park without knowing it.  Check the photos I just put up. During winter, it's little hard to see how beautiful this park is but Spring to Fall, you have to come here and enjoy the view, houses around park, and little veggie vendor.  The veggie vendor owner closes for winter but during the 3 other seasons, you can buy fresh Quebecois veggies and fruits.  All very cheap and fresh.  I saw many tourists took photos in front of the little stand..",5,2/7/2010,Keewi H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-rHPIHFPIaKxYYxqTsGcbQ,"Ithaca, NY",Square Saint-Louis
15,"Square St Louis.. I have had a place on Carre St Louis for about 9 years now and I can tell you lots of stories about what goes on in that parc, but the bottom line is that it is unique.  This is one of those really cool places where you can see all and I do mean ALL walks of life and styles meeting in one common area.  On any given warm summer day you will see mom's with their babies or toddlers, couples on a date, office people on lunch break, a roving group of squeegees, dog owners and their pets (one of which is Clooney the Vietnamese pot Belly pig), assorted musicians, and lions tigers and bears oh my!!  The part with the Tiger is only partially a joke as I personally once played with a 180lbs 11 month old tiger in said fountain, a mere 20+ years ago...The park is always very well landscaped and has been ever since Mayor botanical gardens, was around making it a very lovely place indeed.  The surrounding buildings offer any photographer/ architect student lots of material to view and discuss and one can often see groups of students getting a tour of the various buildings.You can find the row of multi coloured Victorians on the north side on many a Montreal post card, on the south side you can see the Vogel building (294), this building was once the first private hospital started by Mr Vogel, and for many years was the home of Michel Tremblay (5th floor), a renown writer who was very certainly influenced by this Square, among other Montreal locations.Also nice is the use of the building located on the ouest side (near Laval), where they make crepes,  homemade ice cream, fresh squeezed orange juice and where you will find an outdoor fruit and vegetable stand.  The little sitting area just off the cantine, is where you can sit and listen to various and varied musicians, who may or may not add a dancer to their outdoor show.If you in the area and want to have a fun day just sit and people watch, you will not be bored, to make this even better go ahead and google the Square, and surrounding buildings, you will find some interesting facts about it's rich history.",5,2/26/2012,Valerie G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,"Montreal, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
16,"I've been to Montreal twice now, and have made it a necessity to visit St Louis Square. Victorian inspired homes line the park. I've taken over 100+ pictures of all of the homes near and around the park. I'm sure the locals are annoyed by tourists like me, but the homes are so visually appealing that I can't help posing in front of them. My favorite is the red/blue/purple trio of homes right across the little street from the park. I also adore the homes that look like medieval castles.The park itself has dozens of benches, gorgeous trees, and my favorite - a plague of squirrels. I could spend my entire trip sitting on the benches and feeding the squirrels. I'm not sure what the rules are in Montreal in regards to squirrel feeding (I couldn't find any legitimate information), but nonetheless I have a blast feeding them.It is located right by the subway station Sherbrooke and is close to Mont Royal (a wicked shopping spot). I love this park and will continue to visit it every time I am in Montreal.",5,6/16/2010,Patricia M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2LLDDR6AJWBSvtTsXgKu7A,"Edmonton, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
17,"It might just be because me and the boy had a romantic moment here, but I'm now a thorough fan of Carré St-Louis.  But maybe that's what you should head here for as well.The houses around the square are amazing and the square itself has the most delightful fountain where you can sit on the benches around it and watch some of the more daring take a midnight dip.  There is a small shop in the middle where you can buy fruits and veggies as well as ice creams and sweets to enjoy whilst relaxing away in the shade of the surrounding trees.  I could spend hours sitting here and may well do just that next time I'm in Montreal!",5,7/31/2010,Amy S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HNqeYFG_-g9SWt8wfd66Kw,"Groveport, OH",Square Saint-Louis
