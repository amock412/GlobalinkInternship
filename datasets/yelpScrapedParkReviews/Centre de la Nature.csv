There are so many things they can do and it can make for a great family outing.- There's a free animal farm with lots of animals to see such as goats, horses, cows, chickens, roosters, pigs, ponies, mules and so forth. They look like they are taken care of well enough and kids and adult both like to see them.- There's a casse-croute/fast-food joint near the lake. They serve a variety of fast food items such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pogos, fries and so forth. Their menu also has a few more things that clearly caters to kids as well as unprepared parents. :)- Lake has lots of activities. During the summer, canoes can be rented, during the winter you can go skating on the lake.- Plenty of places to plop down onto the grass and have a family picnic.- Lots of trails to be enjoyed and some parts are particularly enjoyable. There's a reason why this place is well known for wedding photos and seeing more than your fair share of brides and grooms walking around.- Huge play park for kids in front of the Farm. Lots of kids here and it can be pretty chaotic... but that's how kids like it, right? :)Cons :- If you're not so much into kids, you may want to avoid some areas during the weekends, there are really A LOT of kids. Some areas may be quiet enough to be enjoyed however if you look well enough.- While their casse-croute/fast food joint has nothing that truly stands out, kindly note the wait time is pretty bad. 20+ minutes to prepare me a couple of hot dogs, pogos and fries? Sup?- Parking is 7$. While contributing to the park is nice and all, it's a bit expensive. So, if you're able to park somewhere nearby freely on the residential streets and bring your stuff to the park, you'll save a bit. You are planning to do a lot of walking anyways, right? What's 10 minutes more going to do?",5,9/10/2014,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
1,"During covid-19, water equipment rental not available and playground section is surrounded by tall metal fences. There is a hand washing station before going into the play area and watched by 2 people. We went for an evening picnic with friends by the water. Parc is very well maintained with beautiful flowers and decoration and can still see some of the farm animals.",5,7/18/2020,Celine H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QHy3WKG8XeWj2JJ7Adb1zA,"Laval, Canada",Centre de la Nature
2,"My friend and I came here to ice skate. The skating area was quite vast and on a frozen lake. There was music playing, a maple syrup shack, and a fire pit. Food is available in the main building and entrance is free! I read in some reviews that there was paid parking, but I didn't see that. We parked for free. What a great place!",5,2/27/2020,Yvette G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
3,"Probably the biggest park I have seen right in a metropolitan city like Laval and this place is huge with 4 lots of parking spaces (7$/day) and plenty of activities to do. There is a building where people can rest and go to the restrooms. There was a hockey tournament going on last weekend, kids join in the fun to win a look-alike Stanley cup. There were free hot dogs stand and free hot drinks from Tim Hortons. I didn't really get a chance to see around because it was way too cold to just walk around to look but I see a board where they specify they offer boat activities, hiking, and biking path. Pretty excited to see how this place looks like in the summer. The snow does not do justice to this amazing park!",4,1/28/2019,Christina T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,"Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
4,Can't count the number of times I've been there and the number of pics I've taken there and the number of family members from out of town or out of the country I've gone with there! Even as a Montrealer it's a must to go there! And bonus there are bathrooms to go to!!! Must go back ASAP! Go you won't regret it,4,7/9/2018,Coolie V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yzGsdfBz1O1Vc-QjhNQAFg,"Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
5,"AMAZING PARK! abundant parking both with the park and also regular street parking outside. Â free entrance and you only pay for what you want to do (paddle boat, canoe, kayak, poney ride, train ride), a super neat park with piano and xylophone, there's a small farm and a petting area, a lake and tons of grass area for kids to play and families to picnic on. really fun place for kids and optimal for parents. i've heard complaints that it can get packed and i can see why considering how family friendly (and cheap!) this place is so i'd recommend going in the morning! our family had a blast, will definitely be regular visitors this summer.",4,6/18/2017,Jeannette L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=N8oEcSShL_-tkVtDhbZ3Xw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
6,"I just love, love, LOVE this park. We came here during the Christmas market with the family and had an amazing time. Bought so many home made chocolates, artisan breads, drank some nice hot chocolate and my son met Santa and was trolled by an elf LOL.During the summer it is a great place to have a picnic and just enjoy the beauty of the park and its' animals.Did I mention how much I LOVE this place!",5,12/21/2016,Sam A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wfXnisPUtsckqx71YRSBOQ,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature
