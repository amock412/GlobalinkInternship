0,"What a great place on a Sunday morning to come out and play some baseball. The nice sized park is perfect for baseball (not everyone plays softball) with a good home-run fence. The infield is made with red sand that fields well for infield ground balls if the sand is groomed well before the game. Please note: red sand means red marks when you slide on the bases so it dirty. Happy to play there again, even if I hit horribly last game! lol.",4,5/28/2016,Denzil D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Ballantyne - Gary Cartier Field
