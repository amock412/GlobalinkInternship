0,"This place is amazingly gorgeous. The structure is huge, just being near it feels extremely peaceful. When walking in, the signs are very clear and it's easy to get through on your own in case you don't want to go through a tour. The view is spectacular being that it is so high up so I recommend going with a camera! Mass was being held in both languages and the signs are available for future times and programming. We noticed that construction is taking place so we are excited to return when everything is renovated. I'm sure it will be breathtaking. If you are in the area and interested in staying in touch with beautiful catholic structures I 100% recommend stopping by. Uber is decent price ($17USD) from downtown Montreal.",5,1/7/2020,Christy M H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Q1INbJRvzHJoEckiBOTU9g,"New York, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
1,"This place has some really beautiful scenic views of Montréal from up on high on the Mountain. But ... Roman Catholicism is a death cult that condones pedophilia. The Roman Catholic Church is known to condone pedophilia by protecting priests who rape and abuse children, and commit other acts of child sexual assault. The Church does not report these priests to authorities, instead they actively conceal their criminal actions by transferring the pedophile priest to another parish or congregation. In many circumstances the Church will protect and even enable pedophile priests by pressuring survivors of childhood rape and childhood sexual assault to reach a legal settlement which also precludes survivors from speaking out about their trauma. These non-disclosure agreements serve to protect pedophile priests from the criminal justice system. There is also a creepy ritual cannibalism aspect to their worship practices. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely patriarchal and problematic institution which practices extreme sexism; women are not allowed to participate equally with men, women are barred from the clergy, and are barred from holding any positions of power or influence within the organisation. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely corrupt, wealthy, and powerful institution; it wields influence like a weapon and inherently acts as an organised crime syndicate. The Roman Catholic Church also failed to speak out against the Holocaust and continues to be silent about the role it played as Nazi collaborator. The Roman Catholic Church also obscures and obfuscates it's role in many other genocides; the Church created, participated in, promoted and condoned, the genocide and exile of Jews and Muslims during the Inquisition. The Catholic Church is responsible for mass murder, forced conversion, and genocide during the Crusades as well as during the colonial conquests in North America, South America, and Central America. Today, the Catholic Church presently promotes missionary work seeking the mass conversion of Indigenous peoples around the world. The Church seeks to destroy traditional Indigenous ways of life and Indigenous spiritual practices. The Catholic Church in Bolivia has actively collaborated in the coup d'état that has illegally deposed and exiled President Evo Morales, the legitimate and democratically elected head of state. Mexico's president has written to Pope Francis to ask for an apology for the Catholic church's role in the oppression of indigenous people in the Spanish conquest 500 years ago. The request was made in a two-page letter that also asked the Vatican to temporarily return several ancient indigenous manuscripts held in its library, ahead of next year's 500-year anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.If you're looking for a philosophy or spiritual practice which promotes peace and compassion, try a different denomination of Christianity like the Unitarian Church, or the United Church, or Unitarian Universalism. You can even venture outside of Christianity. Jesus was a Jew so why not explore Jewish thought and philosophy; Reform Judaism is an excellent denomination. Kabbalah mysticism is excellent spirituality as well. Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism, is also an excellent philosophical tradition. You can go further East with Confucianism and Taoism. And last but not least are the oldest philosophies in the world, the Indian schools of though which promote compassion and nonviolence, such as Sanatana Dharma (a term that describes what we in the West call by the overly simplified exonym: Hinduism) and of course Buddhist philosophies.",1,3/23/2021,Rajendra Réjean K.

2,"This place is Gorgeous and definitely a must !!!My sister drove all the way to the top of this mountain where this basilica is located. Such an impecable and peaceful place. We loved it and felt amazing, plus the architecture is so pretty. There's no entrance fee and there are different floors. We didn't have time to go to the museum but there's one there too.At their gift shop you can find any type of great keepsakes and Catholic things like books, bibles, accessories, frames, and much more.

3,"Been here at least a half a dozen times over the last 20 years (visits even predate YELP) but this is the first time I have reviewed. This minor basilica of the Catholic Church (the largest church in Canada) is dedicated to the life and times of St. Joseph due to the devotion of a little Holy Cross Brother by the name of Andre Bessette - now St. Andre because of his 2010 canonization in Rome. St. Andre is the first and only member of the Congregation of Holy Cross to be canonized; the Congregation is also the founder of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. The basilica in Quebec Canada sits atop Mount Royal and dominates the sight-lines of all of Montreal. This basilica - The Oratory - began with a little chapel in 1904 on the mountainside which arose because of Brother Andre's work. His day job was as the porter and doorman across the street at the Notre Dame College of the Holy Cross order - a position he retained for over 40 years. The lower church (the crypt church) was finished in 1917, the cornerstone of the basilica was laid in 1924, construction of the upper church (the basilica) was stopped by the Great Depression and not restarted until 1937. The basilica officially opened in 1956, and the interior was finished in 1967 - just in time for the opening of Expo 67 (the centennial celebration of the Canadian Confederation).The basilica is a wonder to visit. Entrance is free. This venue is generally crowded as it is one of the most popular tourist sites in Canada ... but do visit. They are going through a rehab right now to reconstruct the parking lots and access point into the basilica - but even though it is crowded and messy, do visit if you have the chance. This is one of the wonders of the Catholic Church and, no matter what your particular religious bent, a shrine of major import.

4,"Went here during our trip to Montreal.  There are lots of steps to walk up to go inside and we saw a woman running up/down them as part of an exercise regime.  I think just walking up the steps is exercise for most people.  It is Canada's largest church and is reputed to have the largest dome in the world!  There is some construction going on and from the sounds of things, it will continue for some time.  The drawings show that you will be able to go up into the dome when it is finished.  There is already quite a view from the middle level of the church!  Although there is lots of beauty, it is not an interior style that appeals much to me nor the rest of my family.  You can see and hear a fantastic pipe organ and concerts are given on Sunday's for free along with a large screen projector, but I have no idea what that means.  While we were there, someone was playing the organ, but not doing the best job.  Surely if you are an organist, you would love to have the opportunity to play there.  I really enjoy a large hall with hundreds of candles that you could light for other people or intentions.  Surprisingly, when you look at the candles through your cellphone, you realize that words are spelled out in the red or white containers for the candles.  Messages of biblical meaning.  It was very nice to see that touch.  Also, in that hall, there were hundreds of crutches hanging up which represents all the people who had been healed there through the years.  There was a museum, gift shop and a cafe, too.",4,3/10/2020,Carolyn B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=D0Caw5JJXmQQ5luhH7ZvxQ,"Cincinnati, OH",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

6,"This catholic church is huge, & beautiful. It rests atop Montreal; & has the most amazing view of the city. There's no charge to visit. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're visiting. Pick a day where the weather is nice, & that'll add to the experience. The building has 8 floors, elevators; & is handicap accessible. I believe there are tours given, as I saw staff walking around with visitors. There's  currently construction going on outside the church, but shouldn't affect your visit in any way.",4,8/6/2019,Henry L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sbQluhVKY0ZCNYGysCTk_A,"Queens, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
7,"This was on our city pass, and although it is a little far from main downtown montreal, it is easy to find by metro.After exiting the metro station, we walked a few short blocks through a small town with a cluster of stores and restaurants. This was the first street I encountered that had signs to point us to the direction of the landmarks we wanted to see. As we turned right after crossing the street, it was only a short distance where we could see the oratory. Entering the area towards the oratory was a landscape of beautiful flowers and grass.Then we had to walk up lots of concrete stairs, but it wasn't too bad because after a short walk of stairs, it flattened out to rest and take pictures of the city  and oratory. The middle stair had signs at French, and it was for those who walk up and pray on the stairs. There were many entrances to the oratory, and so much to see.  It took us at least 4 hours to go through the  whole 4 floors of the oratory and garden. The stations of the cross garden was a very peaceful walk up a semi steep road, with beautiful statues to reflect on, ending with water pouring out a golden lamb into a pond, and a view of the side of the oratory.Although the oratory closes at 8:30, we missed the museum because the museum closes at 4:30pm.Lots of parking, and if you do drive, you at least are able to bypass the stairs going towards the oratory.",5,6/19/2018,Val D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=itNrmwmb2Tm-LKkh2kbBAg,"Honolulu, HI",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
8,"The St. Josephs Oratory of Mount Royal was an amazing experience.   When you first get to their main entry, you will experience a bit of construction on the landscape and parking lot walk-ups to the Oratory. During our visit, these are the must sees: the Votive Chapel, the Crypt Church, the Terrace on the mezzanine level offering an amazing view of the University of Notre Dame, the Garden of of the Way of the Cross, the Basilica itself is truly remarkable.  A final must see is the Original Chapel which is on the backside of the Oratory. Just exit out on the side of the Oratory closest to the lunch area.  We found the Garden of the Way of the Cross to be extremely relaxing, cool breezes, and quite reflective.",5,7/1/2019,Ethan T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,"Orlando, FL",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
9,"Beautiful basilica and grounds! Parking is just 5$ for the day, there is a lower parking and a higher parking in front of the entrance of the basilica. Took us about 1.5 hours to do a tour on our own. The views from the terraces are exceptional and even better than the belvedere on Mont-Royal.

10,"Definitely worth seeing while in Montreal. You can see an awesome view of Montreal while on the top of the Mont Royal. I've been here before when I was a kid, but now back at it as an adult it was just lovely. Get your walking shoes on because in order to enter you have to climb the mountain and the stairway is lengthy. For me wearing a dress that day not the best idea I must say. Because what's cool was the fact that they had three separate rows of stairways. The one that stood out to me was the wooden one where you'd have to make the climb to the top on your knees which represents the sacrifice our fathers made before us and your taking that journey and if you make a wish and succeed the climb your wish comes true. (Next time must where jeans lol) Saint Joseph' Oratory is huge with 6 levels. 1- Welcome center-Votive chapel, Brother Andres Tomb, Statue of the Virgin, Saint Joseph Oil, Crypt Church, and Hall of Renovation Project, 3- Rest area, 4-Brother Andre's Heart and display on his life. 5- The Oratory Museum, 6- Basilica, Original Chapel, Saint Andre Bessette Chapel.Parking is free if you are a student of the University of Montreal or $5 if not and admission is free to the church. However the museum inside is I recall $5 per person.We saw the outdoor garden which depicted Christ's journey with numerous statues and nice horticulture. It was peaceful and serene. We also saw the museum which housed unique displays of nativity scenes throughout the world which was really cool to see. They also had art sculptures, old town maps of Montreal, and beautiful paintings. The chapels and church's are just amazing.",4,7/10/2017,Victoria B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HzcqOHVzHjb1ijr3KSYR2Q,"Aurora, IL",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
11,"Came here early in the morning and was treated to an uninhibited view of the Oratory. It wasn't very crowded; there were mainly locals getting a good cardio workout running up and down the stairs.Wow, let me just say that the Oratory is an impressive site to behold on top of the hill. Despite its humble beginnings in the early 1900s, the oratory has undergone many expansions. It is very well maintained and you'll be rewarded with a beautiful view of Montreal at the top of the steps.Speaking of steps, feeling like you've been a horrible human being lately? You can repent your sins by climbing up the stairs of penance on your knees.Due to time constraints, I didn't get a chance to visit the inside, but I'd love to come back to learn more about the history and architecture.Overall, an awe-inspiring view even for the non-religious.

12,"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit in Montreal, Quebec. This is the first contemporary Basilica I have visited. Very interesting architecture and gardens.It is Canada's largest church.

14,"The Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mont-Royal is an amazing church with a rich, interesting history. The architecture is incredible and awe-inspiring, and it definitely gives you a sense of wonderment. I'm sure if I lived in Montreal I would only attend Mass here on occasion because the grandeur is so eye catching that it would distract me. But as a destination and a thing to see in Montreal, this is truly a special one. There are some stairs, and an elevator that cuts out the elevation, and the lookout points have some incredible views. There is much to explore at the Oratory, so be sure and plan ahead so you see it all.It is Canada's largest church, and a national shrine. and a reliquary in the church museum contains Brother Andre's heart the Saint who founded the church as a small chapel back in 1904.",5,9/23/2016,Michael B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gk7QzENtPjq6gRznGkvcOA,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
15,This is a must visit when in the Montreal area.  It is a magnificent and impressive place.  They do such a great job about providing information in order to fully enjoy your visit and ensure you don't miss out on any of it.  The hall of votives has thousands of candles and it is a beautiful and peaceful site.  Learning about Brother Andre who drew thousands of people to him which led to miracles of people being healed.  He was even named a saint in 2010.  St. Jospeh's is a testament to his life and is a lovely tribute to him.,5,9/11/2016,Krista M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=74Myfl8pOGeKcmkVTimsvg,"Kew Gardens, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
16,"Even if you visit no other Church in all of Montreal, this includes Notre Dame, visit this one. There, I said it. (Please don't burn me at the stake).First off, the land that this place rests upon is huge. If you're driving, be sure to try and get a spot at the highest point possible. If you're walking, good luck. Contrary to prior reviews, parking was free for me (New Year's Special?). The parking lot attendant/traffic enforcer did not ask me for money and I saw no kiosk to pay for parking. Oh well! (Trust me, I more than made up for it at the gift shop).So much beauty and history! I probably missed the guided tour, but roaming around this place with its multiple escalators was so fascinating to me.

17,"A great time here at the Oratory. Parking is $5 per vehicle, which in itself is a steal for Montreal. You can park on the lower level and work your way up, or drive to the top and park there and work your way down. Keep in mind that the parking on top is limited. After not being able to find a space up top, we drove back down to the bottom where there was tons of parking. We worked our way up, which included a decent amount of stairs. Note that once inside, there are a few escalators and even an elevator which makes life easier. The oratory is great with lots to see. The experience itself is free. There is a gift shop on the top with lots of great items included rosaries. Throughout the oratory you can also purchase little guides for a $2 donation. There is a chapel and a shrine area. Behind the shrine is a tomb, which was interesting to see. Also the views fro the top are great, as are the views from the bottom. Be sure to stop along each level and take pics. Overall we had a great time here. There is so much to learn and see here, with technically no fees or admission costs. That being said, be generous and donate or spend some $$ at the gift shop.

18,"My birthplace is filled with beautiful churches.  St. Joseph's Oratory is one of the best!  This Catholic Church is one of the ""must visit"" destinations in Montreal.  I took my wife here during the off peak season so it was not crowded.  Most of the time I have been here, there have been busloads on f people.If you start your self-tour at the bottom of the hill, then you will be burning some calories.  Better have some comfortable walking shoes.  We were amazed to see some people going up the long staircase on their knees (stopping to say a prayer on each step).  St. Joseph's Oratory is a pilgrimage site for many Catholics.  There are a couple of chapels here.  A mass was being conducted in French at one of these chapels.  The Church is truly impressive both inside and outside.  It is massive.  Plenty of photo ops here.  Make sure to grab one of the pamphlets that gives more information and details about St. Joseph's.  There is so much to see and admire here.  Unfortunately, we did not see the Gardens Of The Way Of The Cross.  It was closed for the season.  My wife and I are Catholic so we really loved our trip here!  It was an awesome 4 hours spent here for us.  Does not matter if you are religious or not, one can still find something to admire.",5,3/22/2015,PatrickJ T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,"Bakersfield, CA",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

20,"One of the joys of living in CDN is the close proximity to one of Montreal's iconic sites, L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph, perched along the southwestern side of Mont-Royal. If you are a senseless running enthusiast like myself and wish to torture yourself trying to run up those steps, be forewarned. That said, the reward at the top is worth it. On occasion I've ventured into the actual church itself, which is lovely. I'm somewhat of a recovering catholic, but still know my Our Fathers and Hail Marys, and can probably recite the Apostle's Creed on cue. On a non-mass day, sitting in a pew in the spacious Basilica offers perhaps one of Montreal's most peaceful settings. Speaking of which, there is a prayer garden outside (only open during the warmer months) where one might venture into to seek inner peace. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the candle hall, where visitors can light a candle and offer a prayer (for a small fee). But the best feature of Saint-Joseph's is of course the view. On warmer days, I've sat on the steps just outside the Basilica and seen the most beautiful Montreal sunsets. Even this winter day, I still got to enjoy the view from the snow-covered stairs.

Parking isn't free but there's a lot of available spots.... at least on a cloudy day that I visited it. The church is really beautiful and it holds a special place for the local population with ""Frere Andre"", a local saint reputed to heal the sick and crippled. The design of the Oratory is pretty on the outside as well as inside and the view from the Oratory towards Montreal is very pretty.

30,"What a beautiful, majestic church! This is Canada's largest church and a pilgrimage site that was built in a span of 60 years following the vision of Saint André Bessette, C.S.C., who healed thousands of people during his life and to whom at least 2 million pilgrims still offer up thir prayers every year.The basilica is up on a hill and there is a beautiful and scenic stairway completely worth the walk to the top. Many pilgrims climb the stairs on their knees.This is the world's largest church dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother André credited all his reported miracles. There is a huge display wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the Oratoire and were healed, at the point that Brother André in 1982 was canonized saint a few years ago. The visit takes a few hours as there is a lot to see. There is a room with thousands of candles and a museum dedicated to Brother André, where it is possible to see his heart, which he requested as a protection for the basilica.

But i'm glad I did.After finally reaching the top, I decided to pop into mass - it was fantastic.  Everyone is going to say that the interior of the church is dull or whatever, and I can understand that. It isn't incredibly ornate, but it is still worth a trip inside considering how large the church is. A man inside (who felt the need to call me ""sugar lips"") said it was the largest church in Canada. The so-called observation deck is the highlight.

The building is huge, gigantic, when we walked in, we felt as if we were two dwarves because of the extremely high ceiling, art deco influences, straight clean lines, minimal ornament, cold stark feeling.It seems like the designer was trying to impose a grand religious aura, but with tourist wandering and clicking their camera, children running around, buzzing sound from cleaning machine, this place of worship turn into some tourist attraction instead.It's free and for those who prefer not to climb those steps, there is free shuttle that takes you right to the entrance.",3,12/31/2013,Mr F G And Mrs M S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zZkUkK9M0v02qHBCCm5zaA,"Flushing, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
41,"Location: On Queen Mary, east of Décarie Boulevard. The closest subway stops are Côte-des-Neiges (Orange) and Snowdown (Blue).The Place: Even if you're not religious, this is still worth a visit. Situated at the top of Mount Royal, you can see the dome from a distance on a sunny day - but when you're actually AT the Oratory, the view of the city from the lookout is spectacular. Architecturally, this is a beautiful place. The church itself is nothing special to look at compared to Notre-Dame or some of the churches I saw in Italy, but the energetic pull of the place is something else. You will see many a devout person attending mass here, lighting candles for a loved one or, more importantly, making their pilgrimage to the oratory, from the bottom of the parking lot, up the stairs, on their knees. No, I'm not kidding. St. Joseph's Oratory was home to the now famous Frère André, who was known to heal the crippled, the paralyzed - you name it. You will find walls filled with crutches inside the church, as a testament to all those he healed. You can also visit his teeny tiny home, and see the sacred room where his heart is kept. No, I'm not kidding. Additional info: They have a large gift shop for those who want to buy rosaries and other religious goods, including holy water.Price point: I personally don't remember ever having to pay to access the oratory.",5,8/8/2014,Ann T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,"Montreal, Canada",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

48,"Last weekend was my first visit to St Joseph's even though I've been coming to Montreal since I was a kid. I'm not a religious person so this place didn't have the same effect on my as it would for say, a practicing Catholic. The architecture is nice and seemed very modern on the inside considering it was built in the late 20's. It's a very large building with lots of different chapels. There's always a mass going in one of them somewhere. The main cathedral is over-the-top big and I'm assuming is supposed to make you feel small compared to the hugeness of the catholic mafia... err I mean, god.Since we went in winter, the gardens and other outdoor areas were closed for the season so I didn't get to see all of it.

49,"St. Joseph's Oratory is a breathtaking sanctuary built by the newly canonized Saint in the Catholic Church, Brother Andre, in dedication to St. Joseph. I've visited the Oratory many times, and each time the grand splendour of the building grasped me. Many stairs are to be climbed in order to enter, or you can drive up- the Oratory is placed in a high hill. Inside, the atmosphere is quiet & spiritual. Pilgrims are in prayers and Catholic Mass is held within the crypt of the church many times a day. There is an info desk where you can pick up an ""arrow guide book""- $2, in order to give yourself a tour without getting lost.What you'll find in the Oratory:The Lamp Hallway- This is a warm, dim-lighted hallway with over thousands of vigil lights that you can light for $1. This hallway has many people in prayer.Brother Andre's Tomb- Connected to the lamp hallway, rests the remains of Brother Andre who died on Jan 6, 1937. Here also, people are silent in prayer and veneration towards the newly canonized saint.The Crypt Church- Simple yet beautiful, this is the main place where the services are held throughout the day. I couldn't help but notice the beautiful statue of the main alter of St. Joseph and the marble and oak used in the crypt, very beautiful.Terrance on the Roof- The Oratory has a huge terrance that allows people to have a panoramic view of all the North-Western area of Montreal. You can see the Laurentian Mountains, lake St. Louis and St. Lawrence River. This is a must see and is breathtaking!Brother Andre Wax Display- There is an exhibit showcasing Brother Andre's doorkeeper's lodge, office, hospital, and his preserved heart!The Way of the Cross Garden- A beautiful garden on a hill shows off the natural environment and beauty. As you climb the hill, you see marble religious statues depicting each station of the cross. This garden is outside but attached to the Oratory.The Museum- For around $4 (adult fare) you can see the museum that has an impressive collection of religious art from the Renaissance period, and so much more.There is so much more: Brother Andre's room, original chapel, the souvenir shop (great variety of religious articles, medals and more for very reasonable prices), the cafeteria (offers full course meals), and the Carillion- largest church bells in North America. I had the opportunity to hear them before Mass, the quality and sound of the bells is outstanding!The entire Oratory staff is kind and helpful. The grounds and Oratory itself are maintained very well. I can't wait to come back here again!St. Joseph's Oratory is visited by pilgrims around the world in the thousands each year.

50,"We took advantage of UA's weekend special to visit Montreal over the weekend.  The weather got bad after we book the trip and hotel.  It was raining most the days we are in Montreal.  After taking the bus tour to Quebec in the rain on Sunday, we planned out two different trips for Monday.  One for rain one for no-rain.No rain when we got up so we walked from our hotel and took bus 165 from Guy street to go to the St. Joseph's Oratory.   I used Google map to plan out the bus/walk trip.  It was a lot nicer to walk on Rue Sherbrooke because you pass by a lot of museum and hotels than Boul De Maisonneuve.  The bus ride was not bad.  We met other people who also on their way to the Oratory.  The bus driver told us when to get off and how to walk to the Oratory.  You can also see the tall Oratory when you get off the bus.  Bus 165 did not drop you off in front of the Oratory.  Bus 166 and 51 are the one in the front of the Oratory.When we took the 3.5 hours Montreal bus tour on Saturday afternoon, the tour guide told us there were a lot of steps to go up to the Oratory and it is not recommended.  We had choice between Oratory ($5) and the Botanical Garden ($17.75).  Since it may rain so I picked Oratory.   I learned from past touring experiences it is better to take the ""road"" for car not the stairs for people from our Quebec trip.  I saw the ""shuttle"" sign as soon as you got into the gate at the Oratory next to the info center so we took the shuttle up to the Oratory so I did not have to walk any steps!The Oratory only had 3-guided tour ($5) per day, one at 10 and one at 13:30.  We got there at 10:40 so we paid $2 for a self-guided book.  You can also get a free map if you don't want to buy the book.  I paid $0.50 for a bottle for the holy water near the entrance where the shuttle dropped you off. The inside is a little dark so you cannot really read the book.  We ended up just walk around where we wanted to go without using the map or the guide book.   We found #9 The Way of the Cross and the Gardens of the Oratory right the way.  This was a total surprised since we only expected to see a church not a garden for our trip.  The pool/fountain was closed for cleaning.  A lot of up hill walking, no steps!  I was so happy we took the shuttle so I saved my legs for the garden.My daughter loved #7 The terrace on the roof.  She was able to take a lot of different photos of Montreal with her fancy camera.  This is a good place to read the guide book so you will not miss any exhibits and learned about the history.  I made the mistake until we got home and read the book.Warning - #8 Display-Brother Andre because they have ""The heart of Brother Andre"" on display there!  We were glade we missed this.We took the ""road"" and ""steps"" on our way down so it was not so bad on my legs.  We took bus 51 across the street from the Oratory and got off at the Metro stop to take the orange line (Montmorency direction) to Old Montreal - Place-D'Armes.This experience is very different from Notre Dame.  This was my favorite place to visit in Montreal so don't be scared off by the tour guide about the 100 steps to the Oratory!",4,6/17/2013,Jul W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WY-kbfhVHp_ZOGxxsc5Ctw,"Scottsdale, AZ",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
51,"Driving in from the south, the imposing dome of St. Joseph's is visible from 20 km out - the first visual confirmation that you're getting close to Montreal. For a tourist, this hulking presence is almost impossible to resist, and all the guidebooks confirm that the church is a Top 10 attraction, so of course you make time for a visit. As you pull into the parking lot, picking your way through tour buses packed with pilgrims, you're struck again by the sheer mass of the building perched atop one of the highest points in the city. As you climb the interminable stairs up the side of the mountain, you start to anticipate the architectural beauties that await you at the summit. Several hundred calories later, you finally enter the sanctuary, ready for a payoff that never really comes. Turns out the ooh's and ah's of St. Joseph's are mostly generated down below. At the top, the views are endless, but not especially awe-inspiring, because you're looking away from the Montreal skyline. And the inside of the church is nearly Spartan in its simplicity, with very little to distract your eye from the huge dome overhead. What little effort is made at decoration tends toward a monochromatic, slightly depressing style with a nod to Chagall.",2,9/2/2014,Robert J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qVAXmPLZMyTxONGIrS3gyg,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

The church museum has a display of nativity scenes from all over the world....France is ultra modern, Martinique was all coconuts and China looked like it belonged in a fish tank. There's also a display of select scenes from the life of St. Joseph and the reliquary houses the heart of Brother Andre.

56,"Grand cathedral way up a high perch on Mont Royale.  Being Canada's largest church, I guess I was expecting something a bit more ornate inside.  Completed in 1967, it's a modern basilica and it completely feels that way.  The exterior is impressive.  The inside completely has a modern feel to it.  Getting to this landmark isn't easy either.  It's far from downtown by metro or bus.  You can take the 165, 166 or the 51.  By metro you take the blue line to Côte des Neiges.  Once in front if the cathedral, you'll panic once you see how high up it is.  Don't worry, there's a shuttle that'll take you up to the entrance.  Once inside, there are escalators and elevators so it's well equipped for all persons.  The shrine of St. Joseph is awesome.  The prayer candles light up the room and they're absolutely my favorite part of the cathedral.  Then there's the Votive Chapel, Tomb of St. Brother André, Crypt church and the basilica.  Again, it's modern but still very beautiful.  Once outside, there are the gardens but since it's on top of a huge hill, it's very steep.  Admission is free unless you're doing a guided tour which is only $5.  This is definitely worth a stop over when in Montreal.",4,7/12/2015,Anthony G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AvNmiWFeRlGg5LrhcSj6MA,"Nesconset, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
57,"A completely different experience from Notre-Dame in the old section of the city near the port, but also a must-see destination in Montreal.This church was inspired by now sainted Andre Bessette who was a poor and not well-educated humble French-Canadian priest who devoted his life to helping the poor and the ill.  Many came to see him to be cured of their ailments.  Bessette started his work from a small wooden chapel, which is still there, and donations came in which allowed the Oratory to be built.The Oratory is in Cote-des-Neiges, slightly northwest of Centre-Ville, and it essentially shares the mountain in the middle of the city with Parc Mont-Royal.  It is an imposing structure, atop a big flight of stairs.  However, the parking (no longer free, so no Oratory visit last time) also climbs up to the sides of the complex and there are ways to get into the complex at grade, without stairs.  Its cupola is reportedly the 3rd largest umbrella dome in the world, and maybe the largest cupola in Canada.  The place holds some kind of record in Canada. The interior of the main church is solemn and the simple geometric beveling inside indicates an art deco style (not as in Miami Beach, but just art deco).  The main church is extremely tall, somewhat plain, and very quiet.  For a more intimate experience, the crypt church below is where most Masses are celebrated and it's a lot less ominous because of the much lower ceiling.  Masses are held in, at the very least, French and English.  There are some interesting things here, such as the huge staircase of candles in one of the wings, the museum, and the models of the church.As for the non-religious aspects, there are incredible views from the various terraces of the church.  Mind you, the mountain blocks the view toward the city, but one can look at the northern half of Montreal and all its northern suburbs beyond.  From up there, everything seems very quiet and still.  Generally, I don't like church gift shops, but this one is airy and has a lot of good tourist and/or religious articles you might buy.  There is also a cafeteria on site and, thankfully, it is very low-key and informal.  In general, the feeling here is very peaceful, so it's a shame they started charging for parking because a visit to the Oratory while in Montreal was always calming.",4,5/4/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

63,"Fantastic view of Montreal from St Joseph's...make sure you climb up to the terraces and explore the huge church.  I'm not religious so I mostly visit churches for historical or architectural curiosity, and this church falls into that category.  The area with all the canes and crutches (from those who had visited and were healed) is a bit awe inspiring.  This church is a little farther from all the touristy parts of Montreal, but it's just a couple blocks away from the subway so it's convenient to get to.",3,7/31/2012,Lucy W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oQwFLohuwcJYMd0WhCph-Q,"Atlanta, GA",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

65,"Perhaps it should be called St. Andre's Oratorio now that he has been canonized but I'm sure he would be too humble to want this.  While not especially old, there is a lot to see at this religious site.  In general, I find the interior of the main church actually is the least interesting part - it is beautiful but quite plain.  If you go, take in the other portions, or do so on several visits.   These include the charming little chapel that Brother Andre originally set up; a museum of religious art (changing exhibits), a crypt church which was obviously completed before the main one and has more traditional stained glass; a hauntingly beautiful hall of votive candles; a way of the cross; a grotto and a carillon.  On top of everything, the view is spectacular.While I am an atheist I did find this to be a very impressive place.  I would withhold five stars simply because I do believe that as far as Catholic churches in North America go, I'd rank both the basilica of St. Anne-de-Beaupre and the Cathedral of St. Louis (in St. Louis, MO) as just a bit more impressive from an artistic standpoint.",4,10/2/2012,John F.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j6Kv_wLQzZMWobLIyijX3A,"North York, Canada",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

It is a magnificent work of architecture only minds ahead of their time dream up.  There are many ins and outs, floors, rooms and grottos located within its majestic walls.  Masses, concerts and prayer celebrations are held here as well.  It also houses the tomb and heart (literally) of Brother Andre. In their candlelit quarters, you come upon the Stations of the Cross. From the upper levels you can catch an awe inspiring view of Montreal.

72,"What an absolutely beautiful and gigantic place! St. Joseph's Oratory is a gorgeous church that's built upon Mount Royal and is Canada's largest church. It basically has three sections. The first section (the one closest to ground level) is a very simple church, though it's quite long. There is a very nice section off to the left of the church where there are large areas of candles for offerings. The second level of the church houses a museum (which requires a fee) and a nice (free) section dedicated to (Saint) Brother Andre. The top level is the basilica, and it's the most massive church I have ever been in; you truly can't appreciate the size until you walk through it. From the top level, you can walk outside and visit the small chapel of Brother Andre as well.The church is very peaceful and the view from the top of the church, looking over all of Montreal, is quite amazing.

Fascinating stories about Brother Andre (now canonized) -- I wonder what he'd think of his tiny chapel now.   It's a stunningly contemporary design inside, and the organ is amazing. The votive chapel is lovely, and directly behind it is Brother Andre's tomb (his heart's located elsewhere in the building) and a glimpse at the part of Mont Royal the oratiry was built into. The lame crawl up the stairs to the oratory, and the crutches and canes displayed in the votive chapel attest to the faith of those visitors.",5,6/17/2014,Richard H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-KduD3wwydWDq2GrODh2tw,"Indianapolis, IN",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
76,"The Oratoire Saint Joseph is quite a landmark, as it can be seen from incredibly far away across Montreal. But Getting up there can be a hassle if you're a pedestrian, and once you do make it up, the chapel inside is very lean. There is nothing to see. No art, no decorations, nothing at all except high white walls and dark wooden seats. I'm sure they're impressive in their own way, but being European I must admit that after having done the climb once, I was massively disappointed! They do have a very popular Christmas service, but I haven't been to it as I am not Catholic. On the other hand, the view from above the observatory is delightful, and a place I would definitely go visit again.

79,"Let me start off by saying I'm a former militant Catholic (Bible-carrying, judging other people, celibate, thinking I'm better than others, the whole nine yards) and a current bitter, cynical atheist (being an asshole, judging other people, thinking I'm better than others, being celibate but not on purpose, the whole nine yards).  Reading the other reviews, I can see that most people have a religious or non-religious bias, which is understandable.  I'm here to tell you that I've been to both sides, and as biased as it's going to be anyway, I will tell you about this place straight up for what it is.First off, this is one of the most underrated tourist attractions in Montreal.  I don't know why the hell people don't flock to this place like crazy.  When you first see it, the utter immensity of it hits you straight in the skull.  The sheer manpower it took to construct this beautiful piece of art is just jaw-dropping.  The first time I went I actually had to pick up my jaw off the floor.  OFF THE FLOOR.  It took 12 hours to surgically re-attach it at the Jewish General Hospital afterwards.  THAT'S HOW HUGE AND POWERFUL IT IS.All joking aside, this place will have an impact on you.  I've been to it over 50 times.  This is not an exaggeration.  Go on a Sunday morning, when pilgrims from many different countries (as well as from here) go up the steps on their knees, praying at each step.  Whether or not you are Catholic or believe in God, you can witness the power of religion and its positive effect on people here.  You will see a beautiful view of the northern part of the city from the top.  Inside you will see beautiful architecture and can get a tour of the grounds and insides.  There's a small little ""tunnel"" in the back where the ventilation vents out, and it smells like Bibles.  Go ahead and check it out.  You'll know exactly what I mean.It's interesting to see the old church Saint Andre built before the Oratory was constructed as well.  Although St-Joseph's Oratory is closed at night, you can walk around and/or go up the stairs for a mind-blowing view at anytime.  I would, in fact, recommend doing that at least once.  It is one peaceful place.",5,10/30/2011,Marc A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3mVMqNIvOumVbkyHXNmgUg,"Montreal, Canada",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
80,"Please let me preface with saying that St. Joseph is one of my favorite saints, the other being St. Michael the Archangel. That being said, the Oratory was my Disneyland! My boyfriend-now-husband Floyd surprised me by planning a visit up here from Boston, where we both lived at the time. We're both very active Catholics and spent hours exploring the Oratory. I've visited many basilicas in Italy and of course the Oratory doesn't compare, but it is still a very special place for me.One of the first things we noticed was the four flights of stairs and three pedestrian crosswalks in between each set leading to the Oratory, which I believe is the highest point in Montreal and the second largest dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The middle set of wooden stairs was reserved for pilgrims climbing up on their knees. We both looked forward to attempting the stair climb at the end of our visit.After the Way of the Cross in the garden (Floyd made me pose and take photos next to each station, saying ""It's like each station is a prize on Wheel of Fortune...""), the multiple chapels, and other sites within and around the Oratory, hours passed and Floyd wanted to climb the stairs before sunset. He insisted I stay at the top to take pictures of him, with the excuse that I was in a dress and would hurt my knees. I agreed and Floyd made his way down. As he climbed up, I noticed Floyd clasping his hands, and I assumed it was in act of reverence and prayer. Tourists started staring as he neared the top, and with Floyd beginning to struggle in the heat, I encouraged him to climb the last set of stairs. Upon the last step, after my congratulatory remarks, Floyd urged me to come close. We embraced and Floyd whispered plenty of sweet nothings, including that he would try his best to ""be your St. Joseph, and there'd be nothing more lovely than to have you as my Mother Mary."" He exposed the ring he held in his hands the way up the stairs, asked me for my hand in marriage, and naturally, I beamed and exclaimed, ""Yes!"" We rushed back in, just in time to have one of the priests bless my engagement ring before he left for the day and light a few candles, especially the one for St. Joseph, Head of the Holy Family. It was the most beautiful, fitting proposal, and I will always fondly remember the Oratory as the place we got engaged. I definitely would love to visit again for one of our future anniversaries. Even if I hadn't gotten engaged here, this place is a must-visit for both Catholics and non-Catholics who can appreciate such beauty.",5,5/14/2011,Rochelle A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y7At-JJE35ZrKaGH3Pt1Pw,"Greenville, SC",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

82,"I really have a hard time believing I am the first to review this. This was an exceptional place to visit. Built in the 1960s, it's a shrine dedicated to Jesus' father, Saint Joseph, by the Brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.  It seems one of the monks, Brother Andre (who dreamed of this place) also was known for his curative miracles and people from all over Canada and the world make the pilgrimage here yearly.  It's got four chapels and the basilica (chapels is a loose term-the largest holds upwards of 1000 people) all of which are available for self-guided tour.  There is also the tomb of Brother Andre, a permanent exhibit dedicated to his life, a museum on the history of the holy family, and (seasonally) the shrine gardens for viewing.  The museum is known for its' permanent exhibit of nativity creches from around the world. Guided tours are given and probably the best way to see most of the Oratory quickly, but you can do just a well picking up a brochure at the visitor's center and taking the complex at your own pace. Personally, I think most impressive features are the Crypt Church with its' stained glass windows, the 300 steps (or 99 kneeling steps for pilgrims) to the basilica, and the Votive Chapel where previous grantees of Brother Andre's miracles left their crutches and canes.  Although not impressive at all (as it should be), the chapel of Brother Andre is the original site of his miracles and is located away from the grandeur of the basilica. A word of caution, the Oratory, being built in the mid-1900s, is modern and doesn't have quite the ornamentation of older pre-1900 churches, but nonetheless, it is just as impressive.  It also features a carillon (bell tower) that gives performances most days of the week and a world renown Boys' Choir (Petits Chanteurs du Mont-Royal) which tours internationally in the summer.  I think they are almost as good as Vienna's Boys' Choir.The shrine does have a touristy side with a gift shop and cafe, but at least the Oratory hasn't started charging admission, although they do ask for a donation to view the museum.  There also is a small hostel for pilgrims to the shrine who will be staying overnight.  I did the entire thing in several hours, but you can probably get through it in a hour or less if you want to.  Being a shrine of medical miracles, the place is definitely wheelchair accessible, but to walk the Oratory is a bit of hike.  The basilica sits on the western part of Parc du Mont-Royal and the dome can be seen all over Montreal (I think it's actually the highest point in Montreal.)  The closest Metro stop is Cote des Neiges, but it still a long walk from the Metro station.  I suspect you can catch a bus from the Metro station though.  Also check the website for additional information such as open times.It's a must see in my opinion that definitely doesn't break the bank (READ: Free!)",5,6/11/2009,Lindsey J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ksQQ8Ff0BgmQ3X7NG3GVhg,"Billings, MT",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

84,"I would put 4-5 stars if I was religious. From a esthetic point of view, all tourist will visit at the very least one Catholic Church.

There's about 200-300 stairs easy. for Elder/ Disable / Inactive people not so interested by it, there's an Elevetor from the very bottom. There's also in Christmas time some nice Crèche (In English? Nativity Scene... I dunno)  expositions. There's som guided Tour or simply follow your instinct and walk all over the place. There's some Choir for pretty much every Mess and  it's one of the best panorama you'll have from Montreal. It's not really the same view as  Plateau Mont-Royal. I'd also suggest tourist to discover Cote-Des-Neiges area. Over 100 different cultural community, lot of nice little market/store.
