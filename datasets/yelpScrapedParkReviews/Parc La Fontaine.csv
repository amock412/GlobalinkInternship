0,"La Fontaine is relatively small community park space that has everything for the locals to enjoy active time. Starting with the tennis courts that can be booked through the municipality and swimming pool that operates through the summer months. Then comes the dogs park, which is hidden in between the trees and the boule playground, both areas allowing residents to congregate based on their interests. There are also two playgrounds for the kiddos that were recently renovated. My favorite in the park remains the ice skating rink. It is the traditional outdoor rink, no refrigeration, fully relying on favorable weather conditions. I actually ended up skating once at it and my sweetheart even practiced his hockey skills for an hour. It is relatively well maintained, at night it is illuminated and one can see people playing the favorite Canadian sport quite often. During the day parents brings their little ones for their first ice skating experiences. The park has relatively big parking lot, making the access to all the facilities easy for folks who are not residents of IDS, besides the fact IDS is accessible by public transportation, meaning bus.",4,11/15/2020,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada",Parc La Fontaine
1,"Parc la Fontaine on Nun's Island is nothing remarkable save for the fact that it has a public outdoor swimming pool in Piscine la Fontaine, one of Verdun's 4 public swimming pools and one of only 2 that are open during the summer of covid.This pool is far, far less crowded than the pool at Arthur Thierrien and if you're willing to catch the number 12 bus, you'll be rewarded with a pool that is less crowded, has a small green space and fewer obnoxious Â kids and parents. They also have swimming shifts and rotating times like other public pools during covid but because they hardly ever hit their max, you end up staying as long as you want.",4,7/10/2020,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc La Fontaine
