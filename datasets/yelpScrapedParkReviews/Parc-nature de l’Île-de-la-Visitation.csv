0,"I was looking for a place I can take my son on his scooter to celebrate the summer, a place that I can also bring my dog and doesnt feel like you are in/near a city but has more of an outdoor flavor. This place was PERFECTThe trails are well kept, some picnic tables/area at the edges but most of the walk is lovely, filled with people but yet feels not crowded, great views to the river, lots of birds and lots of dogs (I love places like this). My son loved the riding experience, my dog loved the exercise and I loved the entire bundle. I am sure once the trees will become green again it will be even more amazing and they also have a verity of winter walking trails.

1,Great for walks and exercise and the view and it's simple and pretty I've gone too many times to count! Honestly makes me enjoy it more that it's walking distance from where I live! People should totally go! I only wish  the water was blue just like up north! But we are in the city after all not in the Laurentides!,4,7/9/2018,Coolie V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yzGsdfBz1O1Vc-QjhNQAFg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc-nature de l’Île-de-la-Visitation
2,"Had a great picnic with the family here. Nice big clean park filled with people walking, riding bikes, walking their dogs or like us having a picnic. Great to have this little corner of nature here in the east end. We will come back.",5,9/4/2016,Sam A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wfXnisPUtsckqx71YRSBOQ,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Parc-nature de l’Île-de-la-Visitation
3,"We are so lucky to live walking distance from this park (in fact, it was part of the reason we chose to live in Ahuntsic). In summer and fall, there are lovely walking/running/biking trails beside a beautiful river. Near sunset, look out for the great blue herons and the night herons (bihoreaux) near the old moulin. It's also wonderful to head up near the dam and find a bench to watch the sun set over the river. There are lots of picnic tables and grassy spots to spread  your picnic blanket.In winter there are groomed trails for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails. Check out the events that happen at the maison du parc -- we recently attended a moonlight ski which ended with a campfire and hot chocolate. Magical!",5,2/15/2014,Andrea L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,"Montreal, Canada",Parc-nature de l’Île-de-la-Visitation
4,"Ile de la visitation is a great nature getaway when you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are many great spots for a picnic, whether it be with friends, family or that special someone. The park provides many picnic tables but feel free to bring a cozy blanket! There's plenty of room to have a frisbee match or kick around a soccer ball. There's a wonderful bike path that goes through the park, so if you catch a sunny day, ditch the car and take your bike to this wonderful park! Depending the time of year, you will have the honour of seeing Canadian geese! They flock to the park around early spring. I visit every March to spend time with them. They are lovely creatures! You will of course see male and female mallard ducks, seagulls and other varieties of birds. If you're a bird lover, bring those binoculars and keep your eyes peeled! What makes this park spectacular, for me at least, is the fact that it's close to the water. There are certain parts where you could go fishing, others you can't. However, if fishing isn't your thing, it's nice to hangout near the water and watch the birds scout for fish. You'll enjoy squirrels and chipmunks scattering for nuts and seeds, especially during the autumn season. If you're lucky, you might even see a fox!",4,10/9/2014,Claudia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,"Montreal, Canada",Parc-nature de l’Île-de-la-Visitation
