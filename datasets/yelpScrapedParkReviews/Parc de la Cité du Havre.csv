1,"This spot probably doesn't have any reviews yet, because it's not the easiest to find!I'd recommend picking up a Bixi bike and riding the paths up here to see the sunset. Be careful, as many of the paths are near the highway, or run by some areas where you need to be diligent.There is a large overhang/gazebo at the peak of the park that a family will inevitable claim early in the morning fora a BBQ. There's some benches with a nice view of the amusement park, the river, and the city skyline.Not much else to do up here except hang out.",4,5/31/2016,John J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JdYwgQhnXIWbw9TVR7oBMA,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",Parc de la Cité du Havre
