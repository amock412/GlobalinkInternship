McGill metro offers numerous exits, three of which bring you to major shopping centres. If you are a McGill student, you are also not too far from the Arts Building (a 2-3 minute walk). My only warning would be that if you have classes in the Education or Stewart Biology buildings, it would be easier to get off at the Peel metro station."

Great studies for international students. Great variety of departments. If i like to be student for life time i will choose mcgill. Great institution. Love the free public lectures. Great campus life specially in summer. Lovely spot heart of downtown montreal! Bilingual to some extent yet english speaking university. The university should initiate more public action on climate change, eliminate homeless, support decent residences for students, be pro-active to eliminate government bureaucracy, project plans for  better utilisation of natural resources! Unknown to many the quebec province holds 8 million people and its geography is larger than france! If the university does not educate its own population who will take the lead! Over all every year new initiatives are expected to solution our social issues! I rest my case but great educational institution!"

You can also go to the basement food court in Eaton’s Centre and walk through to Place Ville Marie and arrive at the Central Train station. Walk further you get to Place Bonaventure where you will have access to the Orange Line via Bonaventure Metro. The Atrium indoor skating rink is above the Bonaventure Metro.

Many of the stores near the Mcgill Metro are selling a lifestyle surrounded by beautiful things accompanied by beautiful people wearing beautiful things; then you have the uncomfortable experience walking around all the homeless people and all you can think of is due to the Grace of God  go I."
