There are two entrances to the metro that are further apart than the train’s length. On top of that, there is simply no accurate signage. Lastly, for some reason unknown to me, that station is way warmer than other during the spring and fall period. The good thing is the fact that there is always someone playing an instrument there with decent music."

Formerly, it was done in the ugly orange-brown glazed tile pattern (supplemented by other tertiary colours) that still covers most of the walls in the access areas. The majority of the platform walls have been done over in a more modern style, with multicoloured glazed tile mosaics over the seats, and white stone floors and walls. Although one cannot deny that the look has been much improved, white walls and floor are about as practical in a metro station as carpet in a hospital, and they have quickly become filthy."

There's a Tim Horton's and a pizza place which are pretty good and the fact that there's underground access to Concordia is very convenient for students. Wish it was a nicer station though."

Within Concordia university. Restaurants abound. Fast food included. You have to be choosy. The library is close. Print shops plenty. Yet something is missing. It needs an artistic touch into the chaos! Hard to pinpoint. Put some colors into the alleys. The tunnel metro to Concordia needs wall paintings and joie DE vivre. Enough said be an artist or student or business person you have to be in a pleasant surrounding!
