I could easily drive and park free at Montmorency outdoor parking for full day then take Metro to downtown and after roaming around in Montreal, I take Metro back then drive to hotel from Montemorency. Clean and near station with escalators and lift. The station also has a huge indoor parking lot for 7.75$. I’d suggest using outdoor during weekends as it is easy to find parking spot and weekdays its full by 8am."
