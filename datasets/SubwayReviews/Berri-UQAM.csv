Always dirty, working crews around, unfinished concrete floors and walls, people being rude to the homeless... It serves the function it wants to, by being a central connector for three lines, but so would literally any other metro station if it were built to do so. Good location I guess."

If you are punctual and prefer always to be on time then make sure distribute some minute for this place. Reason is too much public.
Also there is Security presents so they guide and help you if you need. Other benefit is that there is also police security available some time for public safety so you are safe over metro station.
If i talking about outside of metro then it is a place and also there is one biggest public library available in that we can use upto two hours computer and also we can borrow books for our reading hobbies. This place is very peaceful and clam for those who are looking for this type of atmosphere and as per my thunking once you have to visit Berri Uqam inside and outside so you will get good experience."

You can reach the main library from inside. You can get out and walk in the main french quarter of the city st.denis street! Summer the best outside environment! Count the days during summer. Or join the parc just outside the metro.now decide what really you want to do for the next 2hrs. And you can do it while on the spot. The city is yours. Plenty of Gov't offices where waiting is de rigueur. By pass all these and rush for the gay centre to grab a beer or coffee or a light meal. The world is yours for watching. The extra pay is not exorbitant even if you are jobless or homeless. That is in short the other side of montreal you have to experience at least 2x3 times a year. Then you can call yourself proudly I am a montrealer! Enjoy your walks in 4 directions!

Metros are normally on time (like everybody and everything else in Canada) and people are friendly. There are some construction going on almost all the time but IT'S MONTREAL, there's always something under construction.
