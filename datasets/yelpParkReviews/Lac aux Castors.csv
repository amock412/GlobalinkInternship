1,"I enjoy coming to Beaver Lake in the winter to ice skate. There's always a nice atmosphere with the surrounding trees and shining lights. On some of the days, especially weekends, they play music. Also, there's a main building in which there are lockers to put your belongings (bring a lock), a rental area for gear you can use in the park, and a canteen for food. I usually stay for about 1h30 as the lake is quite small and it gets repetitive to go around in the same circle. There are two paid parking lots available.",4,3/19/2020,Yvette G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,"Laval, Montreal, Canada"
2,"I've never been to a landfill but this place reminded me of one! We went in the late evening and saw swarms of large families camped out all over the place with their BBQ smoke and litter exploiting the park. There were pigeons all over the place snacking on the debris. Children were running wild. The worst part, the smell. Worse than a landfill. This is a man made 2 ft deep ""lake"" on top of the hill. There is also a man made ""waterfall"" that is filled with unattended kids running up and down amok. There is also a ""park"" with only 2 baby swings (no children swings) and a spider web to crawl in.Also, crowded parking lots that you have to pay to park in. Definitely avoid if you have any standards!",2,8/26/2019,Kathy S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,"Montreal, Canada"
