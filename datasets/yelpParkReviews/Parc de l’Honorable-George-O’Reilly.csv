1,"A lovely stretch of green space by the river front. Great for walking, biking, rollerblading and plenty of places to walk dogs as well. Many trees are dispersed over the space and places to set up a picnic or spread out a blanket to read or rest. There are several options of paths; at varying distances from the waterfront. There are even a few spots for fishing and looking at wildlife; like ducks and loons. It's a bit of an oasis, but then again Montreal is an island, so if you look you'll find a fair amount of shoreline to explore - but this particular spot stands out to me.",5,10/6/2019,Jeff S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"So this park is yet another extension on the whole LaSalle BLVD bike path. My goal is to eventually figure out the 'boundaries' of where each park ends and the next starts. This one starts at the boundary of Parc des Rapides at the LaSallel/Verdun border. Several nice spots to pop a squat down by the water. Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy! There's a look out point too, a deck overlooking the river. It's been fairly busy each time we've passed so we haven't stopped to enjoy it yet. Our dog likes it over here too, safe to be here being it's technically Verdun so she's not prohibited lol. Lots of other dogs too, enjoying the nice walk with their owners. **...We think we saw a tick today tho, crawling across our picnic blanket after Irie traipsed through the dead-long grass, so beware! Next time we're bringing the tick-kit just in case but Irie didn't get bit today...**",4,4/15/2017,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada"
3,"A park which pretty much straddles the southern-most shoreline of the island of Montreal, along the eastern parts of Lasalle from Parc des Rapides going into Verdun. I'd say there are three parts to the park. First there's the green space between Lasalle Boulevard and the bike paths. This is where you have a small playground for kids, water fountains, soccer field, the Natatorium (the first public outdoor swimming pool in Canada), the greenhouse, a beach volleyball sandlot, and lots and lots of open green, grassy space interspersed with trees and bushes, which on hot summer days is taken up with families doing BBQs, couples picnicking, people on blankets napping, reading books, doing work on their devices, playing frisbee etc.Second, there is the bike path which runs along the riverside and now a gravel path specifically for pedestrians right alongside the bike path since traffic on the bike path is so busy now with bikers, roller-bladers and runners. Third, there is a hiking trail, below the bike path right along the river's edge and this is my favorite part. It's full of trees, bushes, wild grass and it not manicured at all and runs a little wild in some places. This is where, if you happen to be at the right time and right place, you'll see ducks, Canada geese, owls, muskrats, blue herons, Arctic terns, turtles, grass snakes, a beaver or two, raccoons, foxes, pike jumping out of the water (I've seen all of them), Â and on occasion, like this past winter, a bald-head eagle and seal which a local photographer caught on camera. There's also rapids and on clear days, you can see right over to Mont St.Gregoire, Mont St.Bruno and Mont St. Hilaire in the distance. There are also some great quiet spots where you can easily sit down among the large boulders and small grassy knolls and just take in the scenery, meditate and do whatever. While the rest of Montreal obsesses over ""The Mountain"" and crowded Mont-Royal park, I say let them be and come down to ""The River"" instead.",5,5/25/2017,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada"
