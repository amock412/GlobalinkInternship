2,"Just a little park across from Leonard Cohen's house, just a sweet little place where we go to drink a coffee, listen to the old people, feed the pigeons, and a place where we came together when we lost a friend to sing the old songs of peace and revolution. Just a tiny square with a beautiful old gazebo and small tiles lining the tiny walkways. A piece of the old Main, sitting across from new wave café bar Darling, remembering. Sometimes there is also live band karakoe here, sometimes there are dance classes. The apartments around it are in varying degrees of decay and heritage. It's just one block, a couple trees, a place to meet.",5,9/19/2017,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
