1,I work nearby and this is the best place to eat your lunch on a sunny day (Like today! May 17 2017). Lots of clean benches to sit down with a friend and just eat and talk. I also just love people watching and just enjoying my lunch hour outside. I am very excited for the food trucks to arrive because I have a feeling I'll be there every day.,5,5/17/2017,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada"
2,"A nice garden walk in the middle of the city. With a lot of trees, I feel refreshing after a walk here.",4,11/27/2020,Vy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rp9ee4JmMVLkW6U2Qa1dlA,"Los Angeles, CA"
3,"The other half of the two parks here, Place Du Canada. Dorchester (officially, ""Dominion Square"") has more trees and benches compared to the other. And more monuments even though it's about 2/3 the size. Including one to the Boer War and one for Scottish poet Robert Burns.The park is open 24 hours and is a bit of a focal point for pedestrian traffic in the city. It's also well served by the Underground City.",3,4/19/2017,Bruce K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw,"Charlotte, NC"
4,"I visited this place twice during my trip to Montreal.  It has ample benches, a few nice statues and plenty of grass for you to have picnics on.  However since we are on Yelp now, there was one particular aspect I really liked and that was the fact that it has 3 food trucks (different depending on the day) located their between Monday to Friday and one food truck on weekends.  There was one day where I ate from every food truck there.  It was a great mix of unhealthy food, slightly less unhealthy Chinese food, and dessert (crepe).  Having these food trucks located here is very convenient and makes for a great time.Overall, if I worked in the area, I would just sit here for lunch as it is nice and has some decent greenspace.",4,8/24/2014,Bernie C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w,"Mississauga, Canada"
5,"I had brown-bag lunch with a friend here because it is close to where she worked and the hotel I was staying at.  Even at lunch on a Friday in late August it seem really well kept, with lots of people enjoying the last of the sun and grass.  Kids were running around and hardly noticed any trash, only a handful of the usual drunk people.  If I worked around there I would be brown-bagging it too because how nice it is.",4,9/2/2013,Tom Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=E68ZPVpcuWhxvnjq8vTqAA,"Pittsburgh, PA"
6,"This great parc is located right in front of the Sun Life buidling in between Peel and Metcalfe streets. Dorchester square holds a special place in my heart as I spent countless Friday and Saturday nights there drinking 40s as a youth before going out to any of the local bars or clubs nearby.The parc itself received a huge overhaul in the last year or so which has made it more accessible to normal folk and less accessible for drunks, hobos and drug dealers.Although we are approaching winter, this is still a great place to have a picnic, or just to sit on one of the many benches and enjoy the view of the many statues or buildings in the area. It's also a great place for people watching, for those who like that sort of thing! hehe",4,10/13/2011,Andreas D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NfEGoxTuNmSNOJ_lD_MbvQ,"Montreal, Canada"
