1,"WOW this beats any park I've seen in Montreal! It's only a 20 min drive from downtown and there's lots of free parking! I didn't get to see any deer as I've heard are prevalent but it was full of joggers, respectful families, and lots of seniors calmly enjoying the scenery. No wild kids running around and no large families lounging around having a public BBQ left and right (my pet peeve and I see this in many parks). This is a perfect place to go for a leisurely walk and enjoy nature, bike riding, exercising, and the jungle gym is well maintained with swings and fun slides. The park was so huge I didn't get to see much of it but I hope to go back soon and take lots of pics!",5,8/26/2019,Kathy S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"Wonderful park for walking, jogging or to sit and read a book! This park doesn't consist of grass and flowers, instead its a forest with many trails of different distances to choose from. You can do a 2km, 3 km, 5 km or 10km and there are lots of signs to keep you on your chosen path. You will find a lot of birds and deer that are residents of the park. There is also a small lake area with a fountain where you can sit and read or have a picnic. There is a parking lot with free parking, a couple of food trucks, bathrooms and a playground for kids.",4,9/14/2019,Anna C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,"Montreal, Canada"
