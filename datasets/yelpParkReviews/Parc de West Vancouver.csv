1,"Terrific park on the eastern side of Nun's Island, with an undeveloped waterfront with wide open views of the South Shore and Champlain Bridge. Not a lot of picnic tables or park benches but everyone who shows up here seems to be well stacked with their own stuff, inflatable kayaks, stand-up paddles, outdoor bbq, volleyball nets, etc. Nun's Island has an extensive network of bike paths but there's also a great hiking trail along the waters edge, in the back yards of the exclusive residences of this wealthy bedroom community, which also intersect at this park. Given how crazy ""mainland"" Verdun has become in the past 3 years especially that dank beach, I'm happy  to find a much quieter, cleaner and natural place where I can watch the birds, read books underneath  the cool shade of willow trees and possibly venture and wade in the water and not have to see a single obnoxious hipster or man-bun in sight.",5,6/12/2021,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"I feel compelled to write a review about this little park immediately. Why would somebody wonder? Because I just listened to Orchestre Métropolitain performing in West Vancouver Park and attempted to check in during a pause between the musical peices. Well, the park didn't even exist in Yelp. Of corse this is no longer the case as I just created it. So one may ask why at Île des Sœurs exists a park with such an unusual name. It appears the city of Verdun is a twin municipality with West Vancouver, therefore the name. I truly hope the municipality of West Vancouver has a park named Verdun. Now about the park. It is accessible via bike path and has a little playground. The best part is the park is at Saint Laurence and you can go to the river through few access points through the threes. There are also few picnic tables near the water. During cold seasons the park offers some breathtaking views of the river, but the local residents really crowd around during the summer and in big numbers. Orchestre Métropolitain performs at West Vancouver park every year during the first weekend of August. Whoever came with the idea to create this amazing event in beautiful surroundings is a genious. The orchestra is outstanding, the concert programme is always oriented towards more popular and easy to listen classical works, the best approach for a diverse public. Considering the fact the talented conductor Yannick Nezet-Séguin is the new musical director of the Met, tonight Ile des Sœur felt like Manhattan of Montreal. Thus the five stars!",5,8/6/2016,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada"
