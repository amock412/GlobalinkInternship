1,"I love hiking and luckily my wife and kid also love hiking so we were thrilled finally warm weather had arrived to Montreal. We had an amazing sunny weekend and we needed a good hike. I open google maps and started to look for close parks we never visited before. This park is less than an hour drive, so close and looked so promising.Well it delivered everything it promised. If you are into bird watching this is perfect for you. If you want to see other type of wild life (we sae deer's, snakes, beavers, turtles, racoons, field mice...so many creatures) its a must for you and if you just want to experience nature with its great trails and views...perfect.The admission is very low (less than 6$ per person), there is free parking, nice coffee shop and the entrance and a cool playground about 1 Km into the trail. Also cool geocaches if you are into it. A wonderful place for the entire family, they dont accept dogs but with all the animals I understand.",5,5/6/2018,Tomer N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,"Ottawa, Canada"
