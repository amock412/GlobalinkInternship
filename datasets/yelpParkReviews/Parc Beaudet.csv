1,"Another beautiful park if you are in the area. No kid playground that I could see but a lovely space to sit and relax or stroll through.  There is a memorial in the middle of the park with a small fountain.  What caught my eye was the upright piano right at the corner of the park as you exit the subway. I think I read somewhere that its public piano season?  WTH, Montreal?  Have I told you I loved you yet today?  If that piano was in LA, it would be in someone's house by that same afternoon.  Side note about Metro station at Du College...it's so pretty with the stained glass art!  It's not as detailed as a cathedral's would be but it's simplicity was still a pleasant surprise. As I exited, I was just staring and taking my own sweet time admiring the sunlight shining through the glass and turning corners and crevices of what would normally be a dreary subway station into a living piece of art relying on the sun to bring it to full glory.",4,7/12/2018,Jolie C.V.
