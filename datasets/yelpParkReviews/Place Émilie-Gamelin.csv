1,"Two words.Veggie Burger!We wandered over to this beautiful open space to relax and check out a circus performance and were pleasantly surprised by the environment that included a bar, DJ, and dance floor. They have a 'snack bar' on site which is an understatement as the options are much more gourmet than you would expect. I had the veggie burger and a friend had the lobster roll, both of which were restaurant quality dishes and I can't wait until it gets warm enough again to have some more!The environment itself is relaxing and inviting. The levels of grass allows you to lounge and relax while you take in a little bit of everything around you and if you have a lot of energy, a DJ is set up near the snack bar if you feel like salsa dancing (beware there are some pretty good salsa dancers who come out). All-in-all a great place to bask in the Montreal summer.Edit: June 2016 The veggie burger is no longer on their menu! For shame!!",5,4/13/2016,Lily A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_OkEXLN_5T9cMc3UFrLT9A,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"Very cool multi-purpose space in downtown Montreal. People are lounging, drinking, eating, watching the game. Very eclectic mix of people representing Montreal well. From past pictures it looks like a great venue for large events. This particular day we went there was a noticeable number of homeless people. They were harmless though soaking up the sun like everyone else, just dirty and appearing sketchy at first. I love the incorporated artwork - sculptures, a massive net in the sky, and water fountains embedded into the field. There's a covered patio with a large number of tables and then some high tops next to the food stand that has a full set up for hot food and beverages, including a full bar and even healthy fruit and yogurt smoothies. The BLT was enticing as some other menu items, but we stuck with beverages. There was a large flat screen with surprisingly good audio for outdoors; everyone was crowding around it making for a fun, spirited time. Cash only, but they accept US dollars.",4,6/19/2016,Sara S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M0AnYyp5EBMryhTNHR8oqQ,"Tampa, FL"
3,"Many activities here in this park, also fast food available. Wonderful atmosphere in summers. Dance, shows, food and more.Only few tables but bring your tablecloth and lay down in the grass.",4,8/24/2016,Pat M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,"Montreal, Canada"
4,This place is a breather in the city center. Tree and fun under the sun.Also some pokéstops.Take a book at the grande bibliothèque and go read there in the park.,4,8/2/2016,Audrey L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o9XzWtzTuV2X9fyYevXmkw,"Dorval, Canada"
5,"Great cozy neighborhood feel! Adore the re-use of stacked wooden pallets as benches all around. This park is got it goin on! Ping pong tables. A stage for local bands and singer/songwriters to preform. Small tables and chairs for viewing pleasure. There was free swing dance lessons going on one of the nights we were there. And the grassy hill for blankets, people lounging, stone waterways that makes a stream from the top to the bottom of the slight incline. Flanked on two sides with two of the busiest streets in Montreal, this is where we spent several of our nights winding down after dinner.",5,6/13/2017,Gwen W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,"Columbus, OH"
6,"What an awesome and beautiful park on the corner of St Catherine and Berri! We were lucky to overlap the free cirque show the week we were here. The audio was great considering it was an open public space. Great lighting and color smoke and a zip line too. There are some public wooden benches you can sit on. First come, First serve! If you don't get these, you could bring a small blanket to sit on the grass as well. The free show was fantastic tonight. It does run late (1 hr late to be exact!) Overall, would recommend if you're in town!",5,7/13/2017,Vivian N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SyzbL8kotVWE4-RWqqAIkQ,"Ventura, CA"
7,"Definitely contested territory but I love that different parties are working to make this a space that helps make space for - and ideally even connections between - the homeless and addict populations that gather here, local organizations, businesses, students, tourists, and seasonal Pride and Festival partiers. It's not perfect, but there is beautiful public art, mobile soup kitchen, giant chess, some greenery. Last night for the Drag Stars show the stage and sound were great, but I don't get why they needed to fence us in, doesn't seem to be necessary at the outdoor stages during Jazz Fest - maybe it's just that the areas where you can buy and carry beers are so much bigger then? Anyway, it was way too crowded last night, it was fun but kind of scary and I left before I wanted to. I'd like to see the city do a better job with opening up this park out onto St Catherines and maybe the streets around during big events so there is better flow.",4,8/12/2016,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
8,"This park is a super fun place to get a drink or bite to eat while wandering around Montreal. At night there's live music, and there are various gardens and childrens' activity areas. The fountains also provide constant entertainment for kids as well as adults. The eating and drinking and stage part of the park is wheelchair accessible, as several of the patrons enjoying the place were using powered wheel chairs (not just racing chairs that can pop a wheeley to get over small steps). However, the grassy slope area is likely less friendly to wheels. It's a very social and fun environment. There's security in the evening to keep it family friendly, but they are just as customer-service oriented as the bartenders - friendly and calm, just making sure alcohol stays in designated locations and those who get too intoxicated don't disrupt the fun. The Dark & Stormy cocktail was shockingly good, for what is usually a simple cocktail. The sangria tasted very orange-juice-y, and fell a bit flat - I split both drinks with a friend, and we both agreed. They have lots of other fun looking cocktails and food.  I'm so glad we wandered across it and will definitely make a point to find my way back if I visit Montreal again!",5,6/8/2018,Claire W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KQ0CSYnScPzpe2NuWdJxkA,"Chicago, IL"
9,"Nice place to chill out in the middle of the city center! Free and good wifi, small bar/cafe/resto, music, people chilling around, and ""eco"" look and feel. Perfect to rest a little bit in the middle of a day of city exploration.",4,8/21/2016,Kelly S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aBbT7aYWReVpdLY2cF4g4w,"Brussels, Belgium"
10,"This open park area in the city is one of the most amazing examples of why Canada is such an appealing place culturally and socially. I have never seen so many happy and carefree people in my life. My cab driver from Moldova, ""If you walk home at 4am in Moldova, you probably won't make it home with your $400 jacket or your iPhone. Not so in Montreal. Nobody will bother you here.""",5,6/9/2015,Ian J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rld4U_k0IheJTHkz99FIyg,"Seattle, WA"
11,"This park is nice and big and right at the beginning of the gay village. Its a really good spot in the summer to hang out and people watch.During pride, it turns into part central with huge dances and shows, which are usually free (or $2 donation). Theres lots of homeless people around and people selling/doing drugs - but this is right downtown and theres a couple homeless shelters around. They usually just ask for money and if you say no then thats it. I've been going to this park since I was 14, and I've never had trouble. Theres also lots of cops around this park, so it should be all good.",4,8/19/2014,Chase R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t-50IK6nUdA9hoZpl9gnKg,"Montreal, Canada"
12,A great place for a good coffeee! Check out the live bands or Salsa nights!,5,6/14/2016,Dom C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bG2dLL-UvHZeuW1LTahvsw,"Montreal, Canada"
