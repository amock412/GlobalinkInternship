1,"Wonderful neighbourhood park with a little something for everybody.Dog parks (one for large dogs, one for dogs under 20 lbs), TONS of green space for picnics or sunbathing or playing, huge play area for children including sprinklers for the hot days, sports field, etc.Unfortunately it does have lots of teenagers at night but the kids have to go somewhere, I guess.    I love this place for walking my dogs, I'm there a LOT!",4,7/7/2016,Leesa-Catherine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yML2P1evj7FrLncIgaFzHw,"Montreal, Canada"
