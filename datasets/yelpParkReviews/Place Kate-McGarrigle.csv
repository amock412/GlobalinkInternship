1,"We are very big fans of Kate McGarrigle from upstate NY and were so grateful to have this beautiful place to visit and remember her during our visit to Montreal. The ""Kate and Nora"" sculpture is a perfect tribute. There was an upright piano next to the sculpture that was covered and locked- we looked under the cover and saw that it was beautifully painted! It is wonderful to imagine music being played in that sacred space to celebrate Kate's memory. The neighborhood is lovely, it was easy to find a place to have lunch nearby after our visit. Our thanks to the city of Montreal for providing a space to honor the great Kate McGarrigle.",5,6/22/2017,Elizabeth M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=upyMoYIU0MKc382b8rADIw,"Woodstock, NY"
2,"Place Kate-McGarrigle was inaugurated on August 7, 2013, in memory of local musician Kate McGarrigle (known to many as one half of the folksinging duo Kate and Anna McGarrigle, as well as the mother of Rufus and Martha Wainwright).The small, neat park and public square is located among high-end shops on Laurier Avenue West, near to Kate McGarrigle's old home. It has benches, granite seats, and a chair sculpture by the American artist Robert Wilson (donated by the family). It's a nice spot to take a break from a walk or shopping on Laurier, and maybe reflect on Kate McGarrigle and her musical legacy.",4,8/7/2013,Nathalie S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fprkfNhfQ5uNjytHpteLtg,"Montreal, Canada"
