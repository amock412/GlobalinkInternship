1,"Another amazing park. I am just amazed at all the fantastic parks scattered throughout the city.  This one has a huge open green space and various playgrounds including a small baseball field, dog park, jungle gyms, swings, and splash park that looks so enticing on this summer day.There is also a lovely war memorial for those who died fighting in both World Wars and the Korean War.  Doesn't hurt to squeeze in a history lesson for the kids...or adults for that matter.",5,7/10/2018,Jolie C.V.

2,"Verily the sanctum sanctorum of N.D.G. The holy of holies of parks. Parc Notre-Dame-de-Grâce or N.D.G. Park or just plain and simple GIROUARD PARC is just about the best park in the neighbourhood. Call it what you will because wise people call this place by many names and call it what you want because you have free human agency. Yes, indeed, denizens of the good hood of Lady Grace, sometimes we may be No Dame Good but we sure do know damn well how to chillax on a beautiful Montreal day. Yes, citizens of the Deeg, small and large, young and old, squirrel and human, all seek refuge in this park to congregate (whilst respecting the public health and safety protocols to reduce the transmission of COVID-19) and have an excellent time. Yes, the who's who of NDG chill at this park; you've got Rebecca Anne Clark feeding the squirrels sunflower seeds whilst sitting under her favourite Maple tree with her stylish lawn chair, you've got Sarah Ring and Aurora Robinson organising the next NDG Portchfest, you've got Christopher Brown speaking truth to power, you've got elected officials like NDG borough councillor Peter McQueen riding his bike and talking to constituents, you've got the guy who does an improvised yoga/parkour hybrid, you've got the dude who practices his LARPing with a gigantic and extremely heavy wooden sword, you've got the skateboarders filming their skate videos, you've got the dude playing the bagpipes, you've got the couple low-key having sex on the grass in broad daylight, you've got the dog walkers in the dog park, and you've got many other people to people watch. There are lots of amenities in the park and in the vicinity. Yes, this park has got it all and that's not even the beginning of it. Please get a whole grain baguette or pita, some houmous, some vege pâté, some ferments and pickles, and some delicious fruit. Bring a little rose kombucha. Have a little picnic and in the words of KC and the Sunshine Band, ""do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight.""",5,9/25/2020,Rajendra Réjean K. C.
