2,"Maybe small kids would like this but we found this so lame -- and I'll give you my reasons. 1. You can't see the gardens at night! Not a one. LIGHT THEM UP!!!2. LOTS of walking in small paths with TOO MANY People as they oversold this. 3. The ""Light Show"" consists of some balloon animals lit up in the pond and lighting along the long and winding paths. Laserium in the '70's was way better and that was corny even back then. 4. Hard to find the bathroom and for such a mob scene -- ONE URINAL and one stall!  Thought it would be in bad taste to pee in the lake. Maybe I'll come back for the actual Gardens as I hear they are nice.",1,10/21/2019,Trace V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qH-0Nf1nX7u4AABrILgZGg,"Santa Monica, CA"
3,"I really enjoy coming here every few years to experience the Garden Light festival and they have progressively added to the experience by altering some of the light expositions and added new areas.The concept is relatively simple. You show up when it gets dark and you can walk through cornered off sections of the Chinese and Japanese gardens.It gets pretty crowded, I certainly wish they can ""queue up"" people before they enter the exposition. I would prefer to wait 5-10 minutes to walk in so that I can have a clear view of the garden.Otherwise, scenery is beautiful. Buy your tickets online to save time.",4,9/26/2017,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada"
4,"A must-see for me, it's a stroll in the park. But at night. With really colourful lights. In the rain!! How many mud puddles did I step in, I couldn't tell the difference between this dark grassy (super wet) area to the dark leafy (dry) area. The Chinese garden is huge but very slippery in the rain.This happens two months of the year: all of September and all of October. When the sun goes down, the lights are up.The lights are extremely bright and colourful. It's not like traditional Chinese lantern festivals, it's much more modern and child-like. Areas that are lid are:- the path leading into the garden- the entire Chinese garden- all waters of the Chinese garden have lanterns- all corners of the Chinese garden have lanterns- on the rims of buildings and structures- on the trees- on the rocks- the Japanese house beside the Japanese gardenIt's not just a display of 1-2 panda lanterns, each set has its own theme! It's very cute. It gets REALLY dark even with all the lights, because you can't see where you're stepping. Well this was true because I came in the rain.The lanterns over the waters are impressive!!!! So grand!!P.S. I uploaded photos but they're not showing up in this review. So here they are!entranceyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi…Chinese gardenyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi…Chinese garden, omg so magnificentyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi…Japanese houseyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi…",5,10/28/2016,Kathy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg,Hong Kong
5,"Get there early for parking close by. Buy tickets online ahead of time if you can. If not, get them online from your smart phone to skip the line. If all else fails, the line was really long, but it seemed to move fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad. I really thought this place was going to be really cool to check out, and it was, but it was difficult to enjoy. It was crowded, overly crowded, like they let waaayy too many people in. At times it was hard to see, there was lots of bumping into people. It just really reminded me of a concert atmosphere, except I didn't have a drink in my hand and there was no music. Speaking of which I really felt the whole night could've used some kind of background music, I personally felt it was missing. Maybe thats just me being overly critical.We came a couple weeks ago when it was a really unexpectedly warm night. With the crowds it was a lot of waiting to see the next display, waiting to get to restrooms, and waiting to get to a vendor. It was just so slow moving. The area got warm quick, and all I wanted was some water. The vendors were few and far between, and NO ONE sold water! To top it off there were lots of bugs, and they kept annoying me the whole night. By the time we got close to the end, we were over it. My friend even wanted to take the emergency exit to get out faster. All in all, it was beautiful to see but it was hard to enjoy it. Given the chance again, I'd personally pass, it wasn't worth the hassle to me.",1,10/5/2017,Debbie B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IUdoFHIy_t-r5cvH2myX1w,"San Antonio, TX"
6,"Beautiful lit scenery using wire and colorful silk amazed us as we walked through the scenery.  Very impressive.   See my pictures!If you are in Montreal, this is a must see ... check dates and times as it is a yearly temporary event.",5,10/30/2012,Karena J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HvQ45V3LxGbY6-YZ97cvqQ,"Rockville, MD"
7,Totally worth risking standing on line in the cold. Buy tickets in advance online. Also bring student ID for a discounted ticket. Really enjoyed the Chinese garden.,5,10/29/2014,Annie T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cBIkLz-J_qyKAtFCZy9dUw,"Brooklyn, NY"
8,"This is an event that takes place in the Chinese garden inside the Jardin Botanique de Montréal. Lanterns of various shapes and sizes are placed all around the gardens and are lit up at night. The Chinese garden is beautiful, and the lanterns add a sort of kitschy appeal. It is included in the admission to the botanical gardens.",5,1/25/2015,Andrew D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CRVofNhVbgJMuwZ2d1syUg,"San Francisco, CA"
9,"Spectacular! sums it up well.You'll re experience your childhood in this beautiful park and if you have kids they'll love you for bringing them here. There are a also a couple of artwork museums here and there. There will be a lot of walking and amazement along the way. They close the entrance gates after 6 PM, so make sure you park at the correct gates, where you will still be allowed to leave after closing hours.Discount for students and Quebec residents.",5,10/19/2015,Shannon W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oPVY6-CJt2EI335lKWwxmg,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada"
10,"Just in time for the mid-autumn festival is the Garden of Lights. I love it, it's beautiful! Try to come towards the end of the day, so you can see the difference of the garden during the day and night. My only wish is that the bonsai exhibit is open for viewing during night as well.",4,9/19/2014,Jane H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Sd357RRT7uLQ3v52aQaLqw,"Queens, NY"
11,"Need an idea for a romantic evening in Montreal? Forget the restaurants; head to Jardins de Lumiere, on from late Sept to early Nov at the Jardin Botanique.Every year the Chinese lantern festival gets better and better. This year's display of rainforest plants and animals is amazing. Take your time and enjoy the Chinese garden from all angles. You can even have a cup of jasmine tea and a moon cake to enjoy while sitting near the lake.Since last year, the Japanese garden has been added to the light extravaganza. It's an entirely different experience than the lanterns. Walk around the path but then find a place near the pavilion to sit and watch the lights change.Don't miss it!",5,10/5/2013,Andrea L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,"Montreal, Canada"
12,"Go to the Jardins De Lumiere close to 9PM, when the crowds have thinned significantly. I was there at 7PM, and the Jardin Chinoise was at capacity. Besides this minor complaint, it was a very surreal experience. The cold air, the almost surreal placement of the displays (whether it's butterflies, pagodas, or people) and the way it's almost encouraged that you take your time going through each lighted piece.The Jardin Japonais is equally beautiful, albeit in its own way. There's none of the exhibition pieces--instead the whole garden is a dazzling spectacle of lights in different colors and intensities.Allow yourself plenty of time to appreciate the two gardens. It's a wonderful experience.",5,10/28/2013,Myron M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_964p1adQliNVlIxZWsDTg,"New York, NY"
13,"Absolutely beautiful! There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when we went to visit, and while we didn't get to see any of the festive lights or seasonal decorations, we did see beautiful, well maintained trees and fresh snow everywhere.  We took a long walk through the park, ended up standing on top of a frozen lake (on purpose) and got to enjoy the cool breeze without many other visitors.",5,7/31/2015,Samantha D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gll719olq14zMonsJE8mBw,"San Diego, CA"
