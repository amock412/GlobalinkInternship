1,"During the summer the park gets packed and despite that it's always clean. The pool opens too and there are 3 baseball and soccer fields. There is a park for children and space for people who like to work out or play other games.I come through the park pretty late at all times of the year and I often feel pretty safe! They could really use some night lights though, wouldn't recommend it during the winter.",5,12/4/2018,Anthony B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"I love this parc. It has a great swimming pool, picnic tables, kids playgrounds and summer screenings, and tango nights. It can get a bit too packed during summer, never the less it is a neighborhood jem. Tip for groups: buy some beers and fruits at the Metro store nearby and make an impromptu picnic. Tip for loners: at the heart there is a garden with wooden beds- perfect for reading a book in the sun.",4,7/31/2016,Ita S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x8DD07PHJ1CHO8qic4QOgA,"Montreal, Canada"
3,"I love this cool park, during the summer it is so green filed with people having fun in picnic's, playing different social games, ping-pong, Pétanque or just running around the park. It also has some soccer and baseball fields a wonderful kids area and even a dog park. During the winter this park becomes more mysterious once the green goes away but the people are still here, less picnic but still jogging and having fun. It has a few Hockey arena's and the paths become an outside ice skating trails. Cool green patch in the middle of the city",4,12/9/2015,Tomer N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,"Ottawa, Canada"
4,"An excellent dog park! I am absolutely distraught that there isn't one closer to my house, but this is only a half hour walk from me, and it's totally worth it! The people there all know each other well, and the dogs are super friendly! There's occasionally a bark or two, but what else could you expect from a dog park? When I went, there was a fight, but it was immediately resolved very nicely and the people involved were all very calm and well-mannered. I would definitely recommend you going. Note; there are a lot of other attractions at the park (ex; hammocks, playgrounds, soccer fields, etc) but I only visited the dog park aspect.",5,7/13/2017,Sarah J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1YUH30tmBeNe6Emuz72P0w,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada"
5,"Got to Laurier pool at 6:30pm and they closed the pool for water quality reasons at 6:45pm and they didn't want to give anyone a refund. They said to go to Baldwin pool instead, but by the time I would have gotten there, it would have been 30min to closing at best. Never coming back.",1,8/5/2018,Rafaella A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,"Montreal, Canada"
6,"Such a great park!! So many locals hang out in this park everyday and it is really beautiful to see how social everyone is. There is also a pool that is free during the week and 5.00 on the weekends. We wanted to go to the pool, but it was very crowded with a long line on Sunday afternoon. Tip-you can drink in the park as long as you have food.",5,7/30/2017,Christina R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6PX3fRErJzR53UoI1Ktmkg,"Norfolk, VA"
7,"Parc Laurier is a 5 star park for sure, what with the newly shady and sizeable pool, the ping pong tables, the great leafy expanses of gently rolling grass dappled with adorable picnic'ers, the tidy old timey public bathrooms and overall sense of laid back community.",5,7/2/2012,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
8,"Parc Laurier is either my favourite or second favourite park in the city. Big leafy, shady trees in the summer keep this ginger from burning to a crisp, but also a tiny skating area in the Winter to keep me entertained...this park truly has a bit of everything. The swimming pool is lovely (and freaking cold!), the grass areas are plentiful, the public washrooms are decent and close and helloooo, there are ping pong tables, niiiiice. People BBQ, drink wine and act their age here; now that's a great Montreal park!",5,5/22/2013,Janine T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,"Montreal, Canada"
9,Be extremely careful of the dog park. I have found that in Montreal people do not train there dogs properly and was almost attached. It's dangerous. I feel so bad for the dogs.

10,"We've been playing anarchist soccer in Parc Laurier every sunday in the summer for what, like, six years now?  And it's just an awesome parc. We play next to the dog park and man, those dogs go nutso in there. It'd be awesome to do a giant soccer game - dogs vs people except they'd totally win.But yeah, aside from soccer, there's a sweet pool, a massive kiddy park, 2 (count'em, 2) baseball diamond, a huge massive soccer field (which we don't play on, it's so intimidating), and now ping-pong tables and more nook and crannies for you to have a picnic than is even mathematically possible. It's the kind of parc where you go and you're bound to run into one of your buds.So yeah, get your summer on at parc Laurier!",5,7/5/2012,Alex M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iJs63-OOhaD2JvDOJcA4Lg,"Montreal, Canada"
11,"My favorite park in a city full of them. I love also the surroundings. For me, that's the best area in the popular Plateau.",5,12/21/2014,Rafael O.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZuNriu9jxnWSzXOHrlssxg,"Brickell, Miami, FL"
12,"This one sure gets my vote, nicest pool in mtl, and the wading pool is pretty cool as well (if you happen to be 3 ft tall or still have one of those 2-3 yrs old bambino). Thumbs up to the administration for not having those annoying rules and regulations seen in other public pools in mtl (dark wink for the Park Decelles pool in Ville St-Laurent). Actually, can someone explain why in the Park Decelles pool a 7 yrs old kid can't use the pool springboard while there is no age regulation in other Montreal public pools? Are there sharks in the Decelles pool and we don't know about it? Anyway, back to the Laurier pool, pretty nice, has this wooden beach, there are places with shadow from trees so even though you like Red Lobster, you don't need to look like one at the end of the day, lots of showers, and a nicely confusing changing room - this shouldn't be the first time when I unwillingly get into the ladies changing room, sometimes I wonder if it's made so confusing on a purpose. Actually, one weird ( and even up to creepy) thing is that there are toilets in the family changing room, so your kids can freely enjoy and pull one of those hard to find the proper answer observations, about this guy taking a - put he's choice here - in the short height door toilet, such as dad, I just saw his underwear on the floor between his legs, yuk.  (Mooment of silence). Anyway, besides the confusion with the changing rooms, and the absence of a dining tables area inside the pool, this is a very nice place to go. The pool itself it's not too crowded, staff it's polite and cool, cheap entrance fees (can someone hire the managers of the pool for the Montreal's parking fees and tickets please? For once those guys know how to find a reasonable fee without making us feel some sort of a financial molesting like when parking a car in the Sainte-Hélène so called 'public' park area at 16$ for the day.  Oh, and on a nicer ending note, whats up with the young and restless watchers PACKED close to the springboard jumping area? I so need discretion when messing a jump into the pool or worst when loosing my swimwear under the water. Those critical moments are better kept private, instead one feels like being on the stage at the Carnegie Hall.",5,7/28/2013,Royale With Cheese Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OytQDE6-NcsxRYm_WkeG3w,"Montreal, Canada"
