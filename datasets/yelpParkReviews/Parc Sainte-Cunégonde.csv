1,"Baldwin Park is one of my favorite neighborhood spots. I first discovered it while jogging, it's diagonal paths perfect for doing a few figure eights when I was trying to get a bit more time in before turning around to head home.  Now with a young child we love to visit the playground and it's many different areas for different age groups.  In particular we love that they have play structures that are great for toddlers, unlike many parks that cater mostly to the older school age crowd.  In the summer there are water jets, which while not as exciting as some of the newer installations around town, do the job of keeping everyone cool and refreshed on hot summer days.  With many picnic tables scattered throughout the park, it's a perfect picnic destination.  My picks?  Either Vieux Pool Room down on Rachel for steamies and fries or the Metro grocery store up on Mont-Royal for supplies if the urge to picnic hits you after you've already left home.  Something to keep in mind is that Baldwin Park is actually two different areas: one stretches from Sherbrooke to Rachel, and includes what is often known as the Fullum Pool and the community garden; the other is hidden between Mont-Royal and Rachel, and has the soccer fields, playground, bathrooms and fountain.",5,10/6/2016,Amanda C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"Montreal, Canada"
