1,"This is a strange little park along Verdun's riverside. I'm more inclined to call it a green space than an actual park because it's so small. Sitting in front of the Verdun Circus school, it's basically a pretty bare field on one side, an outdoor gym/ workout centre on the other with a few park benches and lounges and some trees and that's about it. I never really see anyone here except maybe some seniors playing petoncle during the day and sketchy looking people who remind me of the dealers I'd see hanging out in the back of the high school I'd gone to.",3,3/25/2021,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada"
