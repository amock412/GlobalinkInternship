1,"Lovely park to go for walk with dog or for snow play (e.g., build snowman) with kids. No playground or sports areas but another park nearby (Le Ber Park) nearby offers this in spades. So, collectively, these two parks satisfy almost all my family's local park needs. A local library and sports complex are with 500m of this park too!",4,1/2/2021,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada"
