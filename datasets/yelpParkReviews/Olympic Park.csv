1,"This is a cool monument to the old Olympic Park.  I think Montreal was one of the only cities (if not THE only) to design their Olympic facilities with the future in mind.  This park still has museums, attractions, and a public sports facility open to all residents.  They reused all of the buildings for something and they are open to the public now.  There's also a ton of green space and areas for picnics, walks, sitting, etc.  Really, Montreal thought the Olympic thing through and got the most out of what they built for it.  It's easy to bike here or take the train and there's tons of bike parking and there's a BIXI station right on the grounds so you can rent and park.  There's a fair amount of things to do here and other attractions nearby so you can fill an afternoon visiting.  I highly recommend, especially if you want to learn about the Olympics or the Expos (les Expos nous manque!).",4,3/30/2018,Jenna S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,"Chicago, IL"
2,"I've always admired Olympic Stadium and came here often back in the days of the Expos.  I enjoyed the architecture and liked taking the funicular up to the top of the tower.A few years ago I was here and went to the bio dome, which was cool.But Olympic Stadium itself is very down at the heels.  When visiting recently for a Pirates-Blue Jays game, you could see how there were a lot of repairs that were needed and pieces of the stadium were being held together with wood and nails.   The outside is a bit removed from it's former majestic stance.Inside, it's also helplessly outdated compared to newer stadiums.  It stunk that the concessions on the upper level could only take cash, which led to long lines at the ATM.  Also, the limited options (hot dogs, chips, sad poutine and even sadder pizza) were not appetizing.   Also, why could you only get Bud or Bud Light ?  Am I in Canada or St. Louis?The sound system is bad, the lighting is not great and the scoreboards are seriously outdated, so this could place could never hope to house a major league team in any sport.  But I still have a soft spot for it.Although I like it, it would probably be for the best if they tore it down and built something new.",3,4/6/2017,Bill T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,"New York, NY"

5,"Ginormous amount of land with an Olympic landmark that is crumbling down due to poor infrastructure. Hmm. It's definitely worth dropping by via CAR if you are a tourist along with a list with the other activities around the area- Biodome, Botancial Gardens, insectarium. There are always activities going on in the area- like food trucks line up for the first Friday of every month- anything special? no- but fun considering street food isnt as popular in the 514. Save the 3.75$ on the commute here and get a post card of the Olympic stadium if you are really keen!",2,8/1/2017,Norine A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,"Montreal, Canada"
6,"I put up a few photos of Montreal's Parc Olympique, the Olympic Park, and I was prompted to write a review.  I thought I already had.  I had actually reviewed venues within it, such as the Inclined Tower and the Biodome.  The reality is that Parc Olympique features even more than these two venues ... quite a bit more.  First of all, it's a park covering an extensive area in a quadrant of Montreal bounded by four major streets.  Then, in addition to the tower and the Biodome is its centerpiece, the stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes football team, but also previously home to the Montreal Expos baseball team.    The other thing to note is that there is a Sports Centre (Canadian spelling), which includes the natatorium used in the Olympics when they were hosted here, as well as a gymnasium and even a sports therapy center.  Montreal wasn't going to let these sit as monuments.  Instead, they generate revenue.  The general public can use the Sports Centre to swim and exercise, though I don't know how much that costs.Getting to the Parc Olympique is easy.  It's really the only major attraction quite a ways east of Centre-Ville and the Metro can get you there.  The stations to use are Viau and Pie IX, and they are on the Green Line in the direction of the Honore Beaugrand terminus.  Getting to the Parc Olympique by car is also doable.  One just needs to follow Sherbrooke eastward from Centre-Ville and the 60 story angled tower and stadium will readily announce when you have arrived.  Parking is expensive, and I have found that patience, reading neighborhood parking signs (only in French), and some distance may reward one with a free parking space on the street, based on the times that I have driven to the complex.The thing that is most striking about the complex is how complex it is.  I'm referring to all the curves and swoops built out of reinforced concrete.  It is amazing and awe inspiring.  Hearing of the budget overruns, however, is shocking.  In various visits to the Parc Olympique, I have been to the top of the Inclined Tower twice and to the Biodome once.  At other times, it's just a great place and space to walk around and see the complex, and all the ramps and plazas around it.  Hoodlums on skateboards seems to think so, too.  One of the Metro stations is tucked underneath one corner of the complex, or so it seems.  In terms of pricing, the attractions are predictably in the mid-range, can be grouped into packages of 2 or 3 venues, and the AAA/CAA card can help knock off a few dollars.As for demerits, there are a few.  Be careful when walking on the grass, let alone sitting on the grass.  It's Canada, meaning there are Canadian geese.  Use your imagination.  Also, at times, the complex looks a little desolate and, in some spots, you will encounter graffiti and reinforced concrete that is spalling.  It's a little long in the tooth, so I'm sure it requires a lot of upkeep.Lastly, note that Montreal's botanical garden and insectarium are across the street.  I always sort of shined on the idea of the city's botanical garden, but I eventually learned that it is actually very nice, both in terms of its contents and its tranquility, and worth visiting at least once.  Given that this is 2016, this means it's the 40th anniversary of the Parc Olympique.  It hosted the 1976 Olympics, when Montreal was experiencing rapid growth, the metro area had two major airports, and I'm sure that the complex, looking both avant garde and spic and span at the same time, was quite a sight.  It still is and it's worthy of nothing less than 4 stars.  Every trip to Montreal has included a visit to the Parc Olympique, even if just to look at it, walk around, and take photos.",4,8/23/2016,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR"
7,"This is always a perfect stop for photos while heading to the Botanical Gardens which is across the street. This is the site of the 1964 Olympics; the rather avant-garde building houses the stadium and is a major attraction which can be toured or you can elect to ride the cable car to the top for a 360 degree view of Montreal. There are several nice vantage points for photos of the the building, stadium and Olympic grounds.",4,6/22/2016,Don P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,"Hampden County, MA"
8,We decided to make a day of going to Olympic park and check out a piece of Olympic history. The metro will leave you within walking distance. We were unable to access the indoor parts of the park since it was closed for an event which was a bummer. We did take a walk around the whole park and took in the historic significance of the 1976 games. The park is still amazing even though you can tell it hasn't been maintained in years but it's still a wonderful thing to experience. There is a large tower ride The Biodome and The Botanical gardens you can check out for a premium price.,3,9/13/2016,Orla M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=txBtOQ8uw0XGAFqLpPcWfA,"Long Island, NY"
9,"Went to see a baseball game here. The seats were far up but it was great view. The arena is big and spacious. I thought it was a bit confusing with all the different signs and numbers, but you get used to it.

10,"It's hard to imagine that this Olympic Park was built in 1976 for the Summer Olympics since it was still in great condition.  It is now turned into a tourist attraction- Biodome, Insectarium, and Planetarium.  If my hotel was not located right next to it, I doubt I would venture there, but I'm glad I did.My friends and I did not go into any of the buildings, but walked around instead.  We saw a whole bunch of people standing by the ramp of the Olympic Stadium and was told that the first Friday of every month, they have a street food festival with food trucks so we checked it out.  There were plenty of food trucks with amazing food.  I was surprised at how organized this was compared to the food truckeroo back home in Washington D.C.If I return to Montreal, I'd like to check out the tower and Biodome.",4,7/7/2014,Priscilla Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Lb8y0GXEzHRgKKCCq8ytqQ,"Gaithersburg, MD"
11,Visited Montreal on a long weekend from Philadelphia one of the first things we did was the stadium tour with Jeff after the Funicular ride. It was amazing. Jeff was so much fun to hang out with. He's definitely an expert. In fact he told us things about philly and Pennsylvania that we didn't know. He went above and beyond to personalize our experience and gave us suggestions for the rest of our stay in Montreal. Do yourself a favor and book this tour especially if you buy a Montreal pass. Plus he's witty as hell,5,1/4/2019,Omar G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4ijOYz-m-A-B8DUNy-U_1g,"San Francisco, CA"
12,"I loved coming to Olympic Stadium when the Montreal Expos played baseball here.  Alas, they no longer do.  In fact, the team no longer exists either.  Sorry, but the Washington Nationals are NOT the Expos!Anyways, Olympic Stadium and the Montreal Tower situated right beside the Stadium are iconic symbols of this beautiful city in my humble opinion.If you are a tourist, then I highly recommend visiting here.  There may even be an event or concert you would like to attend at the time of your visit.  At the very least, you can take awesome pics of the unique stadium architecture and the tower!  Won't see anything like it in the world!",4,4/4/2015,PatrickJ T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,"Bakersfield, CA"
13,"Big open space, with nothing going on. The Biosphere and the other museum type things would be good for families with kids, but the ticket prices seemed high.Unless you're some kind of rabid Olympics fan, or want to visit the Sports Medicine clinic, this one, you could probably skip.",2,3/9/2016,Erika G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kxA0vTDi1KABuA5Tgg1HKA,"Chicago, IL"
14,"E.T. phone home! Apparently it's ride was hanging out in Montreal all along. Am I the only one who thought Le Stade Olympique looks like a vintage spaceship? As a rainy day activity, everyone else took shelter in the Biodome. We braved the torrential downpour and explored the grounds. Besides the area between the Biodome and the main stadium, take your camera and head straight towards the Olympic rings on Sherbrooke and Pie-IX. Overall, I agree Parc Olympique could use some TLC to bring the area into the 21st century. I'd skip the observation tower and reserve that for the overlook at Mont Royal.",3,7/12/2015,Jenny H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1LdXqpTv0bcKQVkQB6Lttg,"San Francisco, CA"
15,"The Olympic Park is easily accessible by bus or train.  There is a lot of construction in the area.  The Biodome and Insectarium are both closed.  The Biodome reopens in December 2019, but the Insectarium is closed until 2021.   It is still a nice area to visit and experience the stadium or the tower.  Visited on a Friday evening and was surprised to see all the food trucks.",3,9/6/2019,German G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mGeKHaXHpxq5KL5rRf00Ug,"Park Ridge, IL"
16,"Easily accessible by Métro though there is a bit of a walk from the station, the Stade is a piece of Olympic history. In 1976, the Games of the XXI Olympiad were spectacular and Montreal is proud to have hosted them. The Olympic park is still here and available not only for tours but also for large events - the stadia regularly have futbal games, the arena has large concerts and sporting matches. And the massive pool is in near constant use.Though it wasn't complete at the time, the big tower is now open and you can ride the inclined Tower for a fab view of Montreal and the surrounding area. Spend a few extra bucks for the guided tour of the facility and get access to some special areas that you wouldn't ordinarily see.Don't miss the flags of the nations that won Gold medals at the Games.

17,"We visited the Olympic Park while staying in Montreal and took the guided tour.  I know that many of the reviews speak about nothing much to see and the place not being well maintained.  That is just not the case.  First all of all the facilities are being used by a variety of different sports teams and other events.  The pool is open to the public and in use almost all of the time.There are a few exhibits, but the thing to see is the actual stadium and pool.  They are both quite impressive.  Standing in the field of the stadium is awesome.  I would recommend the guided tour--very good.",4,7/31/2018,Georgia A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EmQCQ4IbousiY35BN2_TuQ,"Meriden, CT"
18,"We came here for a Blue Jays exhibition game. Our seats were in the 300-level, and we had a garbagey time finding them. No one was there to offer directions, and the range numbering isn't as intuitive as some other stadiums we've been to.Paid $20 for two short beers. But you know, stadiums. You get what you get.Getting in and out by train is a hot mess, so I suggest planning to have a drink in the area before you rush to get back on the Metro.",2,4/3/2017,Catie S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nhPGTThuFWQ7LhKoqBg8Ag,"Ottawa, Canada"

20,"The Concept and design is beautiful but it's clear that this place has not been maintained since its heyday decades ago. The iconic leaning tower over the stadium has layers of paint peeling off. The grounds have dumpsters prominently displayed. It's kind of sad. The nice thing is that the Biodome is nice and the elevator to the top of the tower still works. Make sure you stop at the northwest corner of the Park, where there is a picture perfect opportunity with the torch, Olympic sign, and the stadium/ tower in the back.",3,9/15/2015,Wayne Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qgXcgfdrk5tzmLBq4_h6mQ,"Los Angeles, CA"
21,"If you care at all about architecture or the Olympics, it's probably worth taking a trip to the Pie-IX station and wandering around outside the stadium. It's a big, open, peaceful place to just take a walk when there's nothing going on. Sometimes there's schoolkids just hanging out or skateboarding. It's no place to spend the day, but it's worth seeing.",4,4/7/2016,Adam C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=43Ey_G2M82SpIzHfTkthrA,"Milwaukee, WI"
22,"Saw AC/DC with my family. We had floor seats and the sound and view was terrible. We could barely hear what he was singing, sometimes I couldn't even tell which song it was because the sound was so off. That being said, I still managed to enjoy the concert, I mean it's AC/DC man!! But next time I would try to get seats in the stands rather than the floor. And as others have said, avoid using the bathrooms if you can. We waited a good 20 minutes or more for the women's bathroom. There were huge lines on either side for a grand total of FIVE stalls.",2,1/10/2016,Ashley P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9kLPuapKfGjF6ipVSqIuSQ,"Montreal, Canada"
23,"My fiance and I came here while we were staying in downtown Montreal for the first time. We took the Metro to get here (which is nearby). The building is just very interesting and quite unique. Definitely not something I've ever seen that would look remotely similar. There were other tourists walking around here like us. Nothing else really going on here except for the opportunity to ride the elevator all the way up to the observatory. But my fiance and I were too cheap to fork over the $15 (Canadian dollars) per person. Overall, glad we ended up stopping by here since it is a well known landmark in Montreal (it was our first visit here so we had to do the touristy thing).",3,1/26/2012,Vic C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,"Duarte, CA"
24,This whole area is VERY outdated.  The trails are beat up and surrounded by fencing.  The pool area looks like it has turned into a gym?

25,"I felt very honored to be an attendant to the France vs. Germany women's world cup soccer game. Although France didn't win to play against USA, it was quite memorable being in this stadium. I knocked off a star due to the staff not mentioning our seats were the exact opposite of where we entered. We had to walk all the way through the crowd but at least we were able to view the game while walking. There were a lot of people in attendance and many surrounding us were very loud and fanatical but it made the experience all the worthwhile. I was happy my then bf purchased these tickets while on our montreal trip. I would definitely attend another game here if I'm ever visiting Montreal again.

26,"I tried to imagine Olympic Park as it was when it hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics.  I imagined it to be bustling with activity, filled with athletes and spectators from all over the world who came to participate in an historical sporting event.  In my mind, there was an energy in the air that you could almost touch.  Of course, I wasn't even there, so my assumptions are based exclusively on what I see happening when I watch the Olympics of today; the Michael Phelps era of Olympic history.  Fast forward to 2012, the Phelps era, and a stroll around Olympic Park will make you feel as if you are wandering through a post-apocalyptic wasteland on some far away planet, light years away from its former 1976 Olympic glory.  From what I've read, the construction and planning of Olympic Park was a nightmare before it even started.  Tons of delays, poor budgeting, massive amounts of debt and sub par construction techniques all marred what is actually a pretty awesome looking group of facilities.  As dilapidated as it is, I think it is really cool.  It's futuristic and extremely dated, an eyesore and a masterpiece, historical and irrelevant - a truly fascinating place.  We took a guided tour which brought us to many of the main sites of the park, including Olympic Stadium (former home of the Expos) and the Olympic pool.  I believe the tour lasted just under one hour.  We also went up to the Montreal Tower observation deck for some amazing views.  We skipped the Bio-dome, unfortunately.  We just didn't have time to check it out.  All of the things we did at Olympic Park were worth it, but for me, the best part of it was when I was able to tune out the tour guide and imagine what this place used to be like and how it became what it is today.  I'm just happy that no pieces of concrete collapsed on me in the process.",5,12/1/2012,Nick H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AQA2144dzVsed820TLijKg,"Long Island, NY"

29,"The Olympic Stadium (Stade olympique) is a multi-purpose stadium built as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics.  It subsequently became the home of Montreal's professional baseball and Canadian football teams. Since the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2004), the stadium has had no main tenant, and with a history of financial and structural problems, is largely seen as a white elephant.  It currently serves as a 56,040-seat multipurpose facility for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) during non-winter months, and continues to serve as a venue for Grey Cup games hosted by the Montreal Alouettes (Canadian Football League).I was a HUGE Montreal Expos fan.  Maybe it was my ""closet Canadian"" inclination or maybe it was that cute red, white and blue M, but there wasn't a day during multiple baseball seasons that I didn't keep track of how my beloved Les Expos were doing.  I even had a Montreal Expos jacket for several years and there's still a penant on my wall at home.I also had the opportunity to attend at least a few games in Olympic Stadium and I was never really impressed.  It reminded me a lot of the Metrodome in Minneapolis.  But with my team loyalty, it really didn't matter.So...5 stars for the Team2 stars for the Stadium1 star for Major League Baseball for allowing the team to tank.",3,9/4/2008,Eric B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HFECrzYDpgbS5EmTBtj2zQ,"Genoa, NV"

What blew my mind, too, were the prices to do anything here! My friend and I were able to get student tickets that brought us to the top of the tower, but it was not worth it...at all. While you could see all of Montreal from the top, I couldn't enjoy it completely because I was so agitated for spending so much money on nothing.If you do visit the Parc Olympique, go into it with an open and very creative mind.

They also had a strange rule where they had to pour all of the beers into cups and, naturally, no one at the stadium really knew how to properly pour a beer into a cup. This alone caused lines to get out of control. Prices were terrible too. Only good things about it was that it is on the metro line and that they have a cover for the whole stadium.",2,7/23/2015,Christina P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qjbxthyIS2dco-K6JlzPiA,"Baltimore, MD"
40,"The architecture is really impressive! I really enjoyed walking through this amazing space, my only problem with it is that I got lost a couple of times, they need to signalize the things a bit better.",4,4/2/2013,Mariana L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h6qwN95GHjFPD_bq_IGjgg,"New York, NY"
41,"Parc Olympique is exactly the type of attraction you do to say you've done it...but isn't entirely memorable.  The view from the top of the Tower is pretty amazing--you can see the entire city from all sides.  However, there's not much else to do.  Frankly, it was also a little confusing once we got off the Metro.  While we were there during the off-season (April), there aren't any signs or indications of what all of the buildings are until you walk in.  We bought the combined ticket which granted us access to the Tower and the planetarium.  I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this; just do the Tower.  All in all, it was kind of upsetting to see how not much is left of the area and to see the aftermath of the Olympics leaving town.",2,4/30/2015,Diana B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QRaoB9T7NkMlyuDOAyqPMw,"Philadelphia, PA"
42,"I may be biased because I was a big Expos fan (yes, we existed... in small numbers) but I love the Olympique Stadium.Although I understand that it put my fair city into a large debt, and continues to burden us financially due to numerous roof problems amongst others, there are some aspects of it that you can admire.1. It is a beautiful building: How many buildings in the world do you know that look anything like it? Even with it's age, architecturally, it's one of my favorite buildings I've seen, including in my travels (the outside of it at least)2. The memories: There were times when it was used for important events. I still remember going to baseball games with my father when I was young. I remember the first and last game of the Expos last season where the entire stadium was sold out. I've also heard of concerts by legendary bands Rolling Stones playing there. And even today, sporting events like the Under 20 FIFA World Cup and Montreal Alouettes games can be a great time and great memories for the future.So next time, you throw more money at the city, remember, at least you have the memories (always think of the positives).",5,8/12/2011,Gabriel O.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=COYIE4m3RWJB1gcFfrmexw,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada"
43,You have to go see this futuristic stadium just because everything around is such a train wreck. The concrete plaza surrounding the structure makes you want to cut your wrists. You won't regret going just because of the strangeness of it all.,1,8/5/2010,Garrett Q.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cYFoJKLnAuHg4zyV55w-Eg,"Mid-Cambridge, MA"
44,"Despite all of the criticisms and complaints I have enjoyed every trip I have made to Montreal's Olympic Stadium.I went in: - 1998: To sightsee and ride the elevator to the top of the tower. - 2003: To view a Montreal Expos home game against the LA Dodgers, buying super close field level seats, and receiving Eric Gagne's (hometown boy) autograph - 2009: While finishing the Montreal Marathon (Marathon Oasis de Montréal)All were fond memories.Yes, I am aware that the construction of this stadium has been a financial and structural nightmare for the city.  I can't believe an architect thought up a kevlar roof.  Great idea, genius.  When the roof is on, the field in not so great, with its artificial turf and poor lighting.I wasn't alive to remember the 1976 Olympic Summer Games, so whenever I see this structure, I am saddened and reminded of the city's loss of its not-so-beloved baseball team.  I was a fan of the Expos and really do feel that the 1994 MLB strike and the city's unwillingness to build a new stadium did the team in.  I miss you Youppi!en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol…en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo…en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo…",3,7/2/2011,Hideki K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MbC0xPzIdGkFMCpPb8yWDA,"New York, NY"
45,"One of my favorite tourist destinations in the entire city! Great views from atop the observatory, awesome walk through the biodome, plus I had the opportunity to swim in the olympic pool and jump off the diving boards the last time I was there. Great place to bring your family, but be prepared to pay for everything!",4,3/31/2013,Ian L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9jQwTaSRbKQDtyu4qSWOeA,"Orono, ME"

47,"I was just here for the LA Galaxy v. Impact match as a traveling LA fan. The entire Olympic park is what I would think a North Korean monument would look like. It is cold, sterile, run down and looks like what people in 1976 thought the year 2000 was going to look like.....As for the inside of the stadium...you have one option for beer and it's an import...wait for it....COORS LIGHT (WTF).  The food options are hot dogs, or poutine, the water comes in soda cups with lids and there is a black sheet hanging on one side of the stadium to cover something up. This stadium does not reflect the city at all, but I would not go out of my way to visit the stadium unless I am going to watch a specific team. There are 2 metro stops in the park, so that is a major plus.",1,5/14/2012,George D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dZclswnuCC3xomr8-Wk3Zw,"Hillsboro, OR"
