1,"This is a beautiful park in Westmount and quieter than the always busy Westmount park as it is a bit off the beaten path (and you have to walk uphill to get to it).  Set on a large sweeping hill with beautiful views of the city, it is a delightful setting for a picnic or just a quiet place to stretch out with a book.  A friend told me it was modelled on the Primrose Hill park in London but I don't know if that's just urban myth. On the east side of the park about halfway up there is a nice playground for kids, and a bit further up near the top there is a small wading pool in the summer.  There is also a dog park, tennis courts and soccer field at the top of the park.  In winter, it's a great spot to take the little ones sledding.",5,10/16/2019,Jana T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,"Westmount, Canada"
2,"Quiet and hidden just how I like them.It's in the most beautiful part of westmount the type of area where the houses are ""ouuuu"" and ""ahhhh"" worthy.I decided to come for a picnic and didn't want to get stuck fighting for picnic tables in every other packed park. This place was just right, quiet and you have a great view from the bleacher.There's a few entrances to the park, I however came by the street and came down a little flight of cement stairs that lead us to a huge well maintained soccer field.There's 3 sets of bleachers 2-4 benches around the field as well as 2 benches under a gazebo. There's a water fountain to drink from  right beside the gazebo as well as a huge deck area that has a look out of the rest of the park. At the look out you will notice a dog park to your left and a tennis court to the right there's stairs on either sides of the building to bring you to them.",5,7/29/2017,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada"
