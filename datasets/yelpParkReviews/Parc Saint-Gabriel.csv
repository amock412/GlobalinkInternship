1,Quiet little park in Pointe-Saint-Charles. Lovely yet humble homes along the perimeter and a great place to quickly walk the dog. Ok place to hang out with the kids: Some small children's play areas nearby and there's a community sports complex and library right next door.Alone: the park is 3 stars.With other amenities (library and complex): 4 stars.,4,12/12/2020,Jiro K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,"Montreal, Canada"
