1,NOW DOG FRIENDLY! Just noticed they added a fairly big dog park! There were plenty of dogs there even today! When the weather gets nicer we're guna take Irie there for sure! Now all they need to do is clean up that pool and fix the sprinklers in the kid's area and this park will be worth 5 stars for sure!,4,1/28/2017,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada"
