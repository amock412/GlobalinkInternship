1,"Beautiful park. They have a casino, which is really interesting seeing as this is a family-friendly park. They have La Ronde which is essentially a smaller Six Flags amusement park but with longer lineups, very expensive tickets, and small rides. Been to La Ronde before and I have no desire to go back because I have Canada's Wonderland back home and although Wonderland is crap as well, still a bit better than Montréal. The science dome is incredible! Reasonable price, and great for kids and adults alike who love to learn about engineering, the world and other fascinating parts of our lives. They also have Osheaga and countless other festivals so this park is jammed packed all summer long. Easy subway route so it is always a great time there.",5,8/12/2017,Jordan S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VE70ac9sCIVvH0qih-rKvQ,"Vaughan, Canada"
2,"This is a really nice park. I guess is less of a park and more like a big empty lot where things happen. We came in for a free winter festival. There were food trucks, activities for the kids, ice sculpting, performances, games, ice skating... the works I guess.  It was nice and cold and at times snowing, exactly what we came to Montreal from South Florida for!! I had a great time. The Biosphere is there as well. I didn't enjoy that as much, but got some great pictures. Further down from where we were was a fare of some sort with some slides and ice relates rides. Pretty cool. I also saw an amusement park on the other side, but it only opens in the summer.Overall a great place to spend a whole day with the family. Even pets are welcomed. I had a great time.",5,3/4/2017,Tairyn A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GTM0Jv2ayEgjcwnXXP7D8g,"Coral Springs, FL"
3,One of the best parks I visited in Montreal. It's huge and located in the middle of the St. Lawrence River. I was here for Heavy Montreal and I felt like I wanted to explore the entire park . The park has its own train station which is a plus for tourists!,5,2/2/2020,Gerald L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fxw_VIhRf_9ytqwHdA5h-g,"Los Angeles, CA"
4,Wonderful place to stroll in the late afternoon! Although there is construction going on it is still gorgeous! Saw beavers and different kinds of birds. There is also a bridge you can cross. Worth going and quick access via metro.,5,5/18/2018,Anna H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KLuskrIxd6qTGlgqjjS1Cg,"La Verne, CA"
5,"Best parc ever. The beach is amazing. We had fun at the beach with our friends, our music and food. Really a relaxing place where you can enjoy your time. Kids were playing and swimming safely too. Best ever in Montreal.",5,6/25/2019,Remi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aH-e0gtf7cLjqPpfC0C7Gg,"Montreal, Canada"
6,"So it's a park- on an island. Wouldn't know it unless you looked at a map. Very cool. Lots of events going on including electronic music, food festival and a Brazilian theme party made this park the go to place! Getting here by train is easy. It's a busy weekend, so keep your kiddies close, be patient and have fun. I'm impressed. Clean bathrooms- bicycle  rentals and lots of big trees to rest under.",4,7/19/2015,Sunshine M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sLhx_e9CveYKWQXUzUeCfg,"New York, NY"
7,"We were here specifically for a music festival, so we didn't get time to wander the trails, sit on benches, or otherwise meander through the park itself. Still, I feel like we saw enough of it to be duly impressed.To start, the park is pretty massive. I hadn't realized, going in, that it would be quite so spread out. We took the metro in to the park's station, and I saw a lot of kids on board. I thought to myself, ""Those are some rad parents, bringing their kids to a festival like this, introducing them to good music!"" But a lot of the kids ended up going to the other end of the park upon leaving the metro station, which I found amusing. Sure, there were some kids that were at the festival (more than I had expected), but the ones from our train on the metro walked in the opposite direction from the festival grounds.And the festival grounds, themselves, were massive as well. The festival had two main stages and two side stages, and they were spread out enough that you didn't have to worry about a band from one stage overpowering the band on the other stage (side stages, that is; they didn't have the two main stages going at the same time, of course).There were a ton of little shaded areas where people could kick back in the shade, and the festival organizers had spiffed those spaces up with hammocks and WiFi hotspots, which was a nice touch.The paths between the main and side stages were dirt and rock, but that was manageable. It got a bit dusty with all the people walking to and fro, but again, it wasn't terrible. There were small patches of grass and picnic tables near the main stages, as well, which were nice for those who needed a place to rest during the day. I know we didn't experience everything the park has to offer, but we were there for twelve hours that day, and did a lot of walking. We could see the Biodome from our spot near the main stages, and were able to enjoy a nice view of trees and lush surroundings from that vantage point, as well.I think the thing that impressed me the most is what I touched on at the top of this review: that the park was able to handle a large festival while still keeping part of it open for families and kids to enjoy, without the two being on top of each other, is impressive. I would have liked to have gone back to explore the non-festival part of the park, but our schedules didn't allow for that, alas. Maybe next time.",5,9/4/2015,Jessica S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,"San Diego, CA"
8,"Fete des Neiges! A winter festival, for winter lovers like we! It was a bit G rated, for two hedonistic adults, but we found a lot to be amused by, and wandered for several hours.Vin Chard - mulled wine in a cute commemorative travel mugTraineaux du Cheins - dogsledding!! All the pups are rescue dogs, and look very happy.Maple taffy made in snow!This was a fun wander. Kids doing crafts was hilarious - hacking at snow blocks with screwdrivers and rasps - having a blast. Kids playing hockey, and a general enjoyment of winter.",4,2/8/2016,Erika G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kxA0vTDi1KABuA5Tgg1HKA,"Chicago, IL"
9,This park is literally the center of attraction in summer. International festivals are taking place over two weekends and Piknic Electronik is pumpin' every Sunday. Let us  it ignore the winter events hosted there also. Perfect place for walkers or runners. While wandering you will run into a few sculptures just to make your route a little more interesting.,5,6/28/2017,Tania P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BxOG479iEleffbKoR_X3Mg,"Montreal, Canada"
10,It was relaxing until you have to pay 14 bucks for 2 hours parking or 20$ a day. Where the world you have to pay for parking to go to the park!!!!! This french government fucking suck!!!!,1,5/5/2019,Tommy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lU9rZ3nVBgyxochS0vP28Q,"Montreal, Canada"
11,"This is a beautiful and serene location.  It's a park on an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence River.  And, from this smaller, though not small, island (Ile Sainte-Helene), one looks across at the much bigger island that is the Ile de Montreal.The whole layout is interesting.  First, it is accessed by car from ramps from the Pont Jacques-Cartier, as the bridge changes form from a cantilevered structure to a simple bridge structure on the other side of this island as it connects with the south shore.  Then, the Metro also services this park.  As it crosses the river from Montreal to the south shore, it makes one intermediate stop on the island and the station is called Jean-Drapeau.I have only seen it during autumn colors, and it is mostly quiet, but it is a must-see attraction in Montreal.  There are views at its perimeter, ponds, ducks, squirrels, water features, grassy knolls, forested areas, and some structures such as an aquatic complex, the Biosphere, and an expensive restaurant called Helene de Champlain.  Also, from the Jean-Drapeau metro stop on the island, one can easily walk to the Casino de Montreal, on adjacent Ile de Notre-Dame, or take a hop on a city bus line which continuously shuttles between this metro stop and the casino. (That 3 day STM pass works for all of these treks).Calling this island Parc Jean-Drapeau is interesting and maybe slightly amusing.  It is a commemoration of Montreal's late spendthrift mayor who brought Expo 67, the Metro, and the Olympics to the city.  Jean-Drapeau's mark is everywhere.  He even had a sense of humor.  When questioned about Toronto's upstaging Montreal as the economic engine of Canada, he said:  ""Let Toronto become Milan, we will always be Rome.""  That made for a good belly laugh.",4,5/14/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR"
12,"MEGA OUTDOOR DANCE PARTY!!! =) came for PikNik Electronica ($12 admission)Okay, not JUST for that, but it's the perfect spot. It overlooks the river and out to old Montreal and is home to the Biosphere and botanical garden. When not for a major party, this park is superb for its quaint walkways, water paths, and great views. How do you spot this beauty? You'll see a funky structure that looks like an elongated alien spaceship landing on the ""harbor"". =PReally easy to get here.. just get off at the Jean - Drapeau on the yellow line. If you need a bike..BIXI rentals are just outside the train station!

13,Parking cost $6.50/h everywhere. Bad management team has stolen this place from Montrealers.  You want to go to the pool with young children?  Or maybe want to take a walk in the weekend with the kids?  You have to go by car because there is no way to bring tired kids back home by the metro.  They literally have deserted the park because of the parking fees.,1,4/30/2017,Royale With Cheese Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OytQDE6-NcsxRYm_WkeG3w,"Montreal, Canada"

15,"I'm going to review this island based on the two half-marathons I've done this year. I've been to LaRonde in the past and its ok, but lets talk about the island. For running (in a race or just to run), its super scenic. Theres amazing views of the water, the city, trees and even some trails. I really enjoy it and the races I did there (one in February when it was -33 and one in April when it was 12 outside) were both really good even though the weather was completely different. I recommend coming here for a run for sure!Its also nice and clean. Theres music festivals that happen here in the summer but theres so many people its insane!",5,4/28/2015,Chase R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t-50IK6nUdA9hoZpl9gnKg,"Montreal, Canada"
16,This gorgeous park is beautifully landscaped. I was visiting for F1 but found myself wandering through the park enjoying the shade and the fountains and the flowers! Several very romantic spots to hideaway and have a picnic. From the signs it also seems like there is a significant boat rental area as well. I think I need to come back during a non-race weekend!,5,6/9/2014,Jamey B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_3WpubMD9MfIlt2ySxesXg,"Arlington, VA"
17,Not only is this park pretty awesome but they also have the F1 race over here.  It's a pretty large park with lots to do but honestly I've been here mostly for F1!!!I don't think there's anything more cooler than walking the track after the race.  Someday I'll have to enjoy the rest of the park but when wandering the park for F1 it's massive and there's all kinds of things around it.,4,7/2/2012,Coy W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,"Ottawa, Canada"

19,"This place was a real pleasure to walk around. There wasn't much to do since it wasn't summertime but it was still beautiful to get some gorgeous views of the river and the city, especially since it's conveniently located on the Metro line. My biggest complaint would be that there aren't enough clearly delineated sidewalks or roads for pedestrians. We were basically walking in the road for much of our time there, trying to avoid cars. Since the Biosphere was closed (closes at 5pm), the main attraction was the casino which was more fun than I expected. It looked like kind of a happening Saturday night date place for middle aged couples. There's a bus that takes you straight to the casino right next to the metro station which I thought was really nice. My favorite part was taking pictures from the bridge that connects both the islands. Can't wait to come back in the summertime when all of the festivals and events which take place here are in full effect.",4,4/4/2018,Janet R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qFX1s6XuipkQ54k6wcXjmA,"Los Angeles, CA"
20,"A clean and pleasant park that overlooks Montreal's downtown.  We were there on a Monday morning in October and hardly saw another soul.  The pool looked green and unkept, wondering if anyone had used it in the last year. Overall, I can tell that the park is kept in great condition and the bathrooms were very clean.",4,10/5/2016,Michelle E.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=v_gdWkUoAOvgB29WYbaC2w,"Westchester County, NY"
21,"What came out to be a short visit to the biosphere, turned out to be a memorable and long visit in the parc du jean drapeau. The fêtes des neiges was on going which caught my eye...it was like a winer wonderland full of amazing things that I've only seen in movies and tv shows back at home. From ziplining to snow tubing, ferries wheels, Ice sliding, ice skating, concert, ice sculptures and many more. I loved it so much here and there is so much to do here. Not only that, but there's a variety of food trucks and eateries to choose from throughout the park. I purchased the acropass which I think is the best imaginable deal I've encountered in my lifetime!!! $16 for 4 weekends and unlimited access to on park amenities, rides, food discounts and free access to the biosphere and the museum in the outskirts if the island. I enjoyed myself so much with the snowtubing (1st time) took great pictures. The museum which is an old fort was awe inspiring and educational. I came here last Saturday and ended up back the following day :) I wish nyc had awesome festivals like this one. I highly recommend going to this for any visitors of the upcoming weekend. I believe it's the last one. Also now I have a little buddy hanging by my coats collar as memory...fyi the acropass is a souvenir polar bear..now that's awesome!!",5,1/31/2016,Jordan S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5l4PETuuSGccqwM_uf_3YA,"New York, NY"
22,I came here for the Grand Prix and had a fantastic time.  Another off season joy is that PJD is a wonderful place to come on the weekend when you want some solace and a quiet place to relax (just make sure no racing is scheduled).  It's very accessible from the metro and easy to get in and out.,4,6/10/2013,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada"
23,"Oh yes, this place brings back memories. Parc Jean-Drapeau is located on a beautiful little island on the St Lawrence River. You can get here using the metro or over the bridge. The thing I like most about Parc Jean-Drapeau is that it's one of the best running routes I've ever went on (and I've been to a few). The run there and back (to the city) is around a good 15km, but you get to see the beautiful river, the park, and all the industrial stuff on the south side too. I've been on this run several dozen times and I have just touched the surface of its beauty. Right next to the park is a race track. I haven't been there for any racing events, but I heard it get pretty crazy when there's a race. This is also where they host PikNik Electronic (during the summer). Never been there myself, but I heard it's pretty rad.",5,10/10/2013,JB L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BSVThVjjFaF5orzkW7Of7Q,"New York, NY"

28,Music is cool.  Live bands are fun.  Summer concerts are nice.  Once thing I've learned is life is more fun when you raise the stakes.  If one wants to watch a concert on a tiny island (easily accessible by the Metro) on the Saint Lawrence where the backdrop is the cityscape of Centre-Ville (Downtown Montreal) then this is your spot.  And this spot is legend.  I caught Radiohead here do what they do best in 2003.  It was one of the more majestic experiences of my life.  This experience was nearly marred by a skanky pre-packaged Quebecois ham sandwich which featured some rotten mayo.  Good thing that tragedy didn't kick in until after the concert at the club.  I puked about eight times that night at Stereo.  It was still an outstanding night.I want to go back to Parc Jean-Drapeau._C$,5,12/3/2008,Caleb B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=W3KasfmypfX0UiolENaaHw,"Phoenix, AZ"

I played the last show of the 2006 Warped Tour here. The only downside of that day was that our bus had to park literally a mile from the stage and it was mostly a gravel path. I had to make six trips total to get all my gear to the stage and back. But it was well worth it, biggest crowd of the tour and one of the most profitable days.
