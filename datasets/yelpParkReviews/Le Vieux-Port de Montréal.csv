1,"Went to Montreal and or course we needed to visit the Old Port of Montreal, every time we go we stop at Montreal we always come. It's our first time coming since  La Grande Roue de Montreal was built. It is a great attraction, and there's something of interest for the whole family which is great. You can walk and sit along the old port and look at the beautiful views that stretches over 2km along the Saint Lawrence River. We also love the street vendors, good prices and unique stuff. Everyone was interested in what the vendors had to offer, they were very friendly as well. They also had food trucks.",5,10/21/2019,Viko N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HuESxQX3PLPBUvYWDDP9MA,"Markham, Canada"
2,Beautiful old port that is kind or touristy but we were tourists so it worked. Helps if there is great weather and sunny skies as the view across the river is lovely with lots of Canadian Geese swimming about. Great picture spot especially in fall with all the colorful leaves. Some food trucks and some vendors there as well. Perfect for a picnic in the summer.,4,10/21/2019,Trace V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qH-0Nf1nX7u4AABrILgZGg,"Santa Monica, CA"
3,"I love the old port, it always makes me feel like a kid again, beautiful views, historic sites. I was bored and told myself, you haven't been downtown in such a long time, so I decided to go to the old port. I went to the clock tower where I decided to go all the way up on too, approximately 281 steps, going up was not so bad, but coming that was a whole other story. But if you do try bring your camera as there is exceptional views from up there.Great restaurant, always many street players, they also have la Grande Roue now which is open even during winter. In the summer you can swing you way over the old port. Many activities for all age. What I like about the old port is that its for all ages all occasion form you young couple, to a family with many kids and good in every season.",5,11/7/2017,Sanaz N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,"Laval, Canada"

5,"I'm not entirely sure what's so different about this Yelp listing and the one for Old Montreal, as the lines seem to blur. So I'm not going to wax too poetic here, just in case I'm describing the same thing as that other Yelp page without the word ""port"" in it.But that's the main different to me, is that this is all about that port, and even though all of old Montreal sort of has the moniker of ""Old Port"" that we're dealing with the port part specifically.To be honest, it's still the tale of two ports. Yes, there's the area with all the trinket stands, and the massive aerial playground and the zipline and the paddleboats and the droves of tourists. But I was just wandering around and had the other area of the port with locals walking dogs, jogging, and some really incredibly lovely park-like bits near the water, with ponds, fountains, ducks, walkways, and wonderful flowers.I stood there and looked out across the water and saw the funky architecture, and I watched a boat take off into the river, and it felt like a very port-y experience so separate from the commercial side. But really, both were so fun, each in their own way, and without both I would probably not have deeply appreciated either.",5,9/21/2018,Jeffrey S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,"Midvale, UT"
6,"I like visiting Le Vieux-Port de Montreal everytime we come to this breathtaking city.  The Old Port is part of Old Montreal.  It is over 2 Kilometers long, and it faces the St. Lawrence River.There are plenty of sights to admire.  The most popular are the Science Center, IMAX, and the Clock Tower.  Pretty soon, Montreal will have their own version of the London Eye up and running.  Yup, its the one that looks like a giant ferris wheel.  There are lots of places to eat in the area.  Saw cafes, restaurants, and even a bunch of food trucks.  Like shopping?  There are many vendors selling their merchandise.To me the best part of Old Port Montreal, is to simply go there for a stroll.  Find a spot to sit and chillax.  Maybe even have a picnic too.There are so many things to love about Montreal, and the Old Port happens to be one of them.",5,8/27/2017,PatrickJ T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,"Bakersfield, CA"
7,"A bit under whelmed. Maybe because it was a gray day. Everything seemed so gray. There was a very large empty concrete surface area in the middle seemingly serving no purpose. All food vendor trucks and carts were shut down. There is a big wheel you can go up in, not quite the London eye though.",3,10/4/2018,Matt G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=188nNkbt92KZoF4QtF7ApQ,"Morrisville, NC"
8,"Is there ever a bad day at a marina?  Touristy yet still cool check out of marinas and view from the port to old city.It's not a working port but more as a marina and short tours.  I love looking at boats almost more than cars, so all was good.  Options for all ages but is mostly touristy.",4,7/26/2017,Georgia B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FuHrIYl5tnE0HWdgnIENng,"Atlanta, GA"
9,"Put your tourist tennis shoes on and get ready to stroll.We enjoyed our varied walks through Old Port while visiting Montreal.  There are parks, paths, boats, paddle boats, zip line, museums, food... You can find almost anything to do or nothing to do.  We never found it overly packed but it was busy (if that makes sense).  We didn't even get to all the spots!  Enjoy your stroll along the St. Lawrence river.",4,7/26/2018,Teri D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=T2RyZACHEdEgd6ZQTejv_A,"Grand Prairie, TX"
10,"Summer time Saturday night packed a la max. It's crazy the amount of people filling up the streets, it's almost overwhelming. I love the old port the buildings are beautiful and there's so many neat little restos that I wouldn't usually go to because it's a bit further. Parking there is really hectic good luck to anybody trying to find a spot, my advice to you ditch the car take the metro or a uber.The best part of the old port is the cobble stone they have so many great little streets you can walk down and feel like you're in a little city in Europe. The fireworks are the main attraction I would say and they go off at 10 pm sharp so if you want a great spot go early, personally I always find a great spot away from the crowd and always have a great view. Try to find spots that have a little foot bridge or parking levels that are higher up.",4,8/6/2017,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada"
11,"I absolutely love ports and this one was filled with food trucks/stands - it was SO ALIVE which made me veryyy happy. honestly i can just sit here and just people watch while eating from the food trucks all day but due to the parking situation here (only st parking is available and it's all metered so you can only pay for a certain amount of time) i had to run out right after buying my food. overall, definitely recommend people coming here if they come visit montreal, definitely one of my favorite areas",5,8/6/2019,Sue S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_lHS9UHZTZPWPV_C5mdoeg,"Newark, NJ"
12,"Definitely a must do while in Montreal! There is a lot to see, eat, and do! Start off with some of the local cuisine (poutine!) in the food trucks. There is also usually a little arts festival along the port as well. If you have young kids, there is a little train that takes you around, bounce houses, bikes, carts, and paddle boats! So much fun!! There is also a zip line and high ropes course for the thrill seekers! The only downside to the port is the abundance of aggressive seagulls and bees! I have a little 10 month old and I was constantly swatting them away!",4,8/30/2016,Rachel B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WYDcflbk0EobPzVO-uJ7jA,"Charlotte, NC"
13,"Most picturesque place in Montreal. A myriad of restaurants to choose from, eventful all year long, great atmosphere for families and hanging out with friends. Although known as one of Montreal's touristic spots, it is also frequented by locals, so you won't be getting a fake, touristy experience, you will be living it like a true montrealer.",5,1/5/2020,Daniela B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EdFh9tQCccBFXbdLmiJgHQ,"Brossard, Canada"
14,"Vieux-Port (Old Port) is a hot tourist spot like Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Navy Pier in Chicago, and South Street Seaport in NYC.  Out of all of the above, Old Port is my favorite.  1.  They have ziplining!2.  There is a SOS labyrinth game in a converted warehouse!3.  There is an adorable little kiddy train for young children and their parents.4.  It's located along Old Montreal and maintains its historic vibe.5.  The vendors along the pier are not aggressive in selling you their items.",5,6/3/2016,Jing X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A08xF_ykmsWQV0ypYA8wkA,"Brooklyn, NY"
15,"The Old Port is definitely turning Into the SF version of Fishermans wharf. Unfortunately every city does have it's must visit places. Many tour guides and hotel concierges must send tourists here in droves. It's a place to see some of the oldest part of Montreal. This is the main draw. The cobblestone streets are unlike many other places you see in a canada (other than Quebec City).   The place however is becoming more and more tacky with horse and carriage tour people all over and your typical nick knack tourist shops. I guess it's the inevitability of having demand for lots of foot traffic. There are some wonderful historic places. You can learn about the early history of Montreal and marvel in the old buildings.  A good selection of amazing restaurants and also some interesting courtyard patios within the restaurants all over the place and wonderful boutique hotels. However I could do without the zipline and decor that I believe makes the place look like an amusement park. Here are some abbreviated tips on some of the many restaurants and hotels:Jardin Nelson- albeit expensive is a great place to come for brunch on a sunny day to enjoy some of the jazz and enjoy a few drinks in their unique courtyard terrace. Gibbys is Fantastic for Steak and I'd declare one of the best steakhouses in the city.The keg - two of them here are your staples for Steak at a dinner to expect to cost $40-$50 pp. Olive and Gourmando- although not eaten there, this is the supposed expensive trendy tourist place for lunch. Modavie, Gaspar and  le Chapagnerie are all gourmet and delicious with different menus. The two top boutique hotels are the St. James- it's been whispered through the grapevine that when Madonna is in town she reserves a whole floor for her and the entourage she travels with. Hotel Nelligan is upscale elegant and very impressive if high end hotels are your budget. The Westin, W and Intercontinental are a bit further walk away but not unreasonable. Just make sure you are able to walk a bit longer. If not, it's always easy to take a cab down. Sure tourists come here in droves and it's understood. Parking is always hellaciously difficult (on the street) and if you park in a city lots is $16 for the day which is gouging in my mind. Overall the place is a 3.5 for me but perhaps I'm somewhat jaded as it's becoming a tad more boring for a local.",3,9/13/2015,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada"
16,"There is just so much to see - history, eating, dining, shopping.Walking around Jacques Cartier place this is pretty much the touristy hot spot of Montreal yet it has such a great charm and vibe you won't mind being a tourist yourself. Old world mixed in with some modern amenities.This area is a terrific spot to stroll the cobblestone streets or wander blissfully along the riverside and take in the sights.More than enough to spend a day or two taking in the historical buildings, plenty of cafes to grab a bite, bars to enjoy a libation, and some street performers always doing something fun to watch.We walked around here for days and never got tired of it. Even just to take a seat at an outdoor bistro to people watch and see the world walk by.",4,11/5/2016,Phil H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,"New York, NY"
17,"Old Port is the place to be in the summer. There are so many activities to do, food to eat, people to see. It looks gorgeous in the summertime. Lots of people say it's touristy, which it is, but it still feels so nice. Get a Bixi and you will have an awesome day.Also check out the pirate themed adventure park opening this summer, there's going to be a huge zipline!",5,5/17/2016,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada"

19,"The first thing you notice walking in Old Port is the cobblestone! It's sooo nice to be able to enjoy this part of town and absorb the French culture from architecture of the Notre Dame, clock tower and museums. All the sites and shops and restaurants preserve the sophistication of France. No matter the time of year you must stop by. On the summer nights,you'll catch the street concerts and performances.  In the winter months you can ice skate in the St. Laurence River. It can seem a bit touristy at times especially with most of the little shops. But it is considered an attraction.",5,7/25/2014,Nik E.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6TKVrW5byD8pVPlF4dtUhg,"Los Angeles, CA"
20,"Driving through Old Port in Montreal was a treat for our eyes. Beautiful narrow streets with cobblestones, breathtaking majestic buildings leaning from old sites. I am not a huge fan of tourist shops, but I would raise my eyes just a little higher not to be bothered by them.Old Port hosts amazing galleries, shops hotels and restaurants. Too bad its not possible to visit them all. We chose to drink the famous white Sangria in a beautiful Garden Restaurant with live Jazz music. Maybe another tourist spot, but still absolutely amazing. I hope I will be back to explore more streets and shores. And taste that amazing poutine of theirs.",5,9/8/2015,Michaela P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O59T-4QC1Ud8euM8mq834A,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
21,"Absolute visit regardless a tourist or local resident or not.  Big history and architectural buff.  Still remember the cobblestones and water views.  St. Lawrence quite historic.  Imagine even 300 years ago, explorers were using this to cross the Atlantic Ocean.",4,5/1/2017,Kenneth N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Xwnf20FKuikiHcSpcEbpKQ,"Richmond, Canada"
22,"You find me, you find meYou find me by the riverYou find me, you find meYou find me where the river flowsBy the riverWhere dreams will never dieBy the riverUnder suburban skiesYou find me, you find meYou find me where the river flows...It reminds me of other Vieux-Port, miles and oceans away, in small town of Marseille... Vieux-Port de Montréal share same feeling of open space, artistic freedom and just a right measure of old times charm and grunge. Along it runs functioning railroad, and the bike path, and the walkways that follow curves of the ponds, cutting through park greenery (altho it was snowy white this time around). I am enamored by it industrial charm - and cannot resist those rusty piers and old machinery.Ships still here, and old buildings still stand on water edge, and Clock Tower keeps ticking time away....But the new is weaved in - the clean paved promenade, Science Centre, IMAX.It's nice to walk though any time of the year, and bars/cafes aplenty along the water edge to take a break and enjoy fresh breeze.",5,1/21/2015,Nadia Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=c3xkFRo38JB7T0xgiPOEbw,"Staten Island, NY"
23,"This is a must see place in montreal!! It's my absolute favorite place to go on a sunny day and was tempted to visit multiple times! Old port has most historic buildings, a huge slope that usually has children friendly entertainment and a old city vibe to it with it's cobble stone streets.

24,"The old port has that special magic during the summer months that one has to experience at least a few times in their lives. The architecture of the buildings are very European. It also has a waterfront with lots of activities, beautiful arts and fancy restos to appeal to both tourists and romantics. It's a nice place. The main street is full of intriguing merchant stalls that will draw you, paint you and entertain you.The problem I have stems of its popularity, I dislike coming here by car as parking and traffic can be quite insane at times. Coming by metro is long and labourous. There's WAY too many people at times (particularly during the fireworks) and the restos are very expensive.This doesn't take away from the Old Port's charm for tourists but as a local I don't go out of my way to come here often.",3,9/15/2015,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada"

26,"Wandering around Old Montreal--Vieux Montreal--is a step back in time and well worth the experience.  The negative comments about the touristy shops are well taken, but simply gazing upward to view the wonderful architecture and the unique buildings is rewarding.  There are also parts of the area that are not so tourist-minded and there are wonderful restaurants there as well.This is a part of the city that must be seen.",4,7/31/2018,Georgia A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EmQCQ4IbousiY35BN2_TuQ,"Meriden, CT"
27,This place might be a reason for me to move to Montreal. It absolutely beautiful even on a rainy day. It really merges the European and the diverse Canadian culture into one. I love how everything feels very authentic from the architecture down to the cobblestones you walk on. Came here everyday during my weekend stay in Montreal but I would definitely spend a full week just roaming around the port and maybe one day taking a cruise down the river!,5,5/17/2016,Nikka A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EJ06AkT83sNiERIPOAuPuQ,"Yorkville, Toronto, Canada"
28,"Absolutely beautiful scenery, building with a new urban french style and lots of activities. I checked with my favorite app YELP to see what kind of events was happening around the which to find the Vieux Port/ Old port. Le Festival YUL EAT ( Basically Montreal's version of a Somrgasbur). I didn't get to try any of their delicous food because it was so hot outside but i did get a frozen pleasant Pena colada smoothie that cooled me right down.

Yes a musical festival done out in the freezing cold, only city to do so. The challenge presented gives you no choice but to dance as much as you can for warmth lol, you can't stop. There was the superglisse slide, 2 stages for music, fire pits for warmth which was ideal...the music was great and this whole event was well worth the 340+mile trek from nyc lol.

31,"Vieux-Montreal is far and away my favorite part of town.  The city started here in 1642.  No tour of this town would be complete without exploring the cobblestone streets that line the South side along the St. Lawrence River.  You can actually walk through the old ruins at Pointe-a-Calleire.  How cool is that?  This is the place for people watching, trinket shopping and general sightseeing.  There are a lot of landmarks around here, so do your research and explore the history of town.  Don't worry, just about everyone here speaks English and French and will throw the switch when you say ""hello"" and you'll be good.  I made multiple loops through the Place Jacques-Cartier snacking on some great gelato.  My Frommer's led tour was quite insightful and you know what?  That building next to Basilique Notre Dame looks just like the Empire State Building.",5,8/2/2010,Dan G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=brQ7OjB6f9nXWGk45A9A3g,"Chicago, IL"
32,"If you have but one day to visit Montreal, this is the one spot you must visit. The Old Port (also known as Old Montreal) is the historic, old part of the city, and it contains all of Montreal's most historic sites and buildings. Take the time to read the plaques affixed to most edifices, as you will get a free history class! There are old museums (and some new ones as well!), and narrow cobblestoned streets (ladies, don't wear high heels!), and gorgeous old stone architecture. Walking down the old streets - especially at night, when the area is illuminated and takes on a magical glow - one truly feels as if one is in an old, old section of Paris. It feels like old Europe. I've never gotten the sense of an authentic, French , historic area outside of France. Certainly not anywhere in the States. And this is precisely why Montreal is unique.Caleches (horse-drawn carriages) are always a-plenty here, night and day. Many of their carriages are ornately bedecked with flowers.There are tons of touristy tchotchke shops here on the main drag (lovely Rue St. Paul), but there are also wonderful restaurants, bistros, art galleries, artists' quarters, ivied courtyards, narrow cobblestoned alleyways hidden off the larger roads, musicians and artists out painting and performing, and more. Central to the are is Place Jacques Cartier, bordered by outdoor terrasses and bistros and gorgeous, imposing old buildings (including old City Hall). To get a feel of life back in the 1600s, you can visit the adjacent Chateau Ramsey, housed in a real home from the 17th century. Bonsecours Market is right off the square as well (note: there are a lot of nice, clean public bathrooms here), as are old churches and more courtyards.  Of course, bordering the whole area is the Port of Montreal and the waterfront. They have really beautified the waterfront in the past ten years or so, and it's very walkable now. One area has food trucks, and there is a long strip of restaurants and shops and vendors, with a large eating area at the base of Rue. St. Laurent. I especially like how they demarcated the streets with large, vertical street signs, and I was also impressed by how they incorporated bike paths and walking trails all along this waterfront strip.There is an impressive, contemporary Museum of Architecture at one end of the waterfront promenade, on Place d'Youville, and a block further lies Gibby's, a wonderful, elegant steakhouse housed in a 200-year old stable building. At night, this whole area is bustling until the wee hours of the morning, due to all the cafes, bistros, clubs and bars. Pedestrians will be out strolling late too, as the stores are open late on weekends and especially in the summer. It'll be hopping even after midnight with young native Montreal's going out clubbing or to hear jazz musicians at The Red Piano. This is a vibrant part of the city and truly not to be missed.",5,8/17/2013,Nancy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,"Vancouver, Canada"
33,"There's always something going on here to keep everyone entertained.  It's a great place to come visit on a sunny day.  There are food trucks, cheap bike rentals, performances, zip lining and even Clock Tower beach all the way at the end where you can grab drinks and enjoy the sun.  Saturday nights during the summer, it's also great to watch the 10:00 fireworks show.  I loved coming here every evening.",4,7/12/2015,Anthony G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AvNmiWFeRlGg5LrhcSj6MA,"Nesconset, NY"
34,"So yes, walk up and down Place Jacques Cartier, as this is pretty much the touristy hub of Montreal but also adorable and joyful in brief tastes if you're local. The narrow cobblestone alleys that lead off the pedestrian square are pretty and tucked with the usual tshirts and maple candy, their real virtue in them is in leading to the further stretches of the Old Port where there are art galleries and better restaurants and boutiques with higher end designers. If you walk along the water towards the west you can see the giant old grain storage and the speakers on the shore that let you hear your voice echo around the empty old icons of industry. Eat a lobster roll, check out the crazy architecture across the water from back when Montreal was a 60s stoner dream of what the future would look like. I suggest starting from Champ de Mars Metro and then Walking up McGill to Square Victoria but anyway you do it just get lost in there, have some wine and cheese, have fun.",4,8/4/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"

44,"It seems like a world away and forever ago, but I experienced the Old Port during the middle of winter. Yep, *that* winter. Luckily, during my time there, the city was experiencing a heat wave of near forty-degree temps. I'm not being a smart-a$$. This past winter was brutal. 40 was warm. Being a long-time Chicagoan, the temps didn't bother me in the least. I'd heard about the Old Port and I wanted to have at it.Like most cities that are built for the cold, Montreal was able to showcase the best of the Old Port without batting an eye. I was absolutely charmed by the cobblestone, bridges, light shows, installations, skating rink, and music. The entire port area was filled with people taking pictures, going on walks, sight seeing, and taking in the fun of a winter wonderland. Walking along the frozen water, I spent a lot of time lost in thought and appreciating the stillness. Yep, despite the kids shrieking (in a good way) at the skating rink and the 'thoom thoom thoom' of the bass as the electronica played on, the quiet beauty of the environment fully enveloped me and I walked through the waterways to attempt to take it all in.With plenty of shops nearby, hot chocolate at the ready and Old Montreal waiting to welcome you, the Old Port gladly gives a taste of Old World life in North America. Living in Miami and coming to this part of Montreal, I felt as though I had time traveled. This is a good thing.

The people here are friendly, polite, courteous, manners you won't find in New York City. There are a few historical sites, plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars, and some street performers.

It features some really beautiful architecture, as well as a great view of the saint Lawrence river. The architecture reminds me of the small villages in southern France. We wandered aimlessly looking in shop windows and all the smaller art galleries featuring the work of many well known artists.    At one point it started to rain so we dipped into one of the many patio restaurants on the main drag and had a quick drink while we waited for the rain to subside. After the rain let up we continued our walk soaking in the sights and sounds.

The location was superb.  So after walking by in the afternoon, I decided to head back with my spouse.  They have a very nice casual sitting area to the right with comfy couches.  The night was beautiful so the atmosphere was great with the cool night air and the Latin dance beat playing overhead. We got there at 9:15 and there were 7 tables ... so not too busy.  First they didn't bring us a menu for a full 10 minutes, so I finally gave up, hailed one of the waiters and asked for the menu.  Then we watched him head back to the bar, clean up, do something on the computer and load up drinks for the table next to us and still no menu.  After shooting him a couple of looks, he finally brought it almost 20 minutes after we had arrived.  In retrospect, this was the missed moment when we should have gotten up and left. Everything after that was poor service. Yes our waitress was nice but when you ignore us and prioritize bussing a table to bringing us our check, I don't really care if you're friendly. The chicken sandwich was yummy, but the mojito needed more authenticity.  I wouldn't come again although if they had a dance floor to go along with their Latin dance music, I might swing by for a night out... as long as it didn't involve table waiting or watered down mojitoes.",1,5/27/2015,Roxanne M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-yWRu63UPP_f6PZ3WaUX1g,"Silver Spring, MD"

Make sure you taste some maple syrup & ice wine along the road!Some tips if you are driving:- Pay CLOSE attention to the signage. At the very least, know the French words for the days of the week so you know when you can and cannot park in a particular spot.- If you park along the parking meters, take note of your parking spot letter & number and go pay at the machine nearby.

58,"The Old Port is one of those magical places that made me fall in love with Montreal. This part of town houses most of the historical buildings in the city, and runs alongside the piers on the St. Lawrence River.It's a great place to hang out during the day. You can visit all the tourist attractions and admire the architecture of the historical structures. There are tons of fancy art shops along the streets for you to check out. It's also nice to walk or run along the water while the sun is out. This was part of one of my running routes, going through the Old Port to Ile Saint Helene and back. During the night, it's a great place to admire the city lights as well as for stargazing. The lights from the city blends with the stars, lightly illuminating the historical buildings and giving off a quaint sense of relief. I always walk around there at night when I need some room to breathe and some private time just to ponder about life. In the Winter season, there's a skating rink there worth checking out. It costs more than Parc La Fontaine (which is free) but they usually have better ice and awesome music selection.

And who can resist a labyrinth, regardless of the cost?Instead, I'd like to review a function of the Old Port that folks often forget about, the fact that it is also a show venue. Les Quais du Viex-Port is a section of the Old Port that sometimes gets turned into a concert stage. This might be great for summer events and free shows. However, I'm not so convinced about how it gets converted into an entrance-fee venue. I saw Björk perform there a couple of years ago, and it was fantastic, but let's face it, that's because it was Björk. Aside from the musical component, the ""venue"" is just a flat gravel surface surrounded by a makeshift fence. Not exactly ideal ambiance for more intimate gigs. I decided to write this review because I'll be seeing Portishead play at les Quais du Vieux-Port in October. While I'm thrilled about the show, as the trip-hop defining band have not been here since 1998, I'm not so thrilled about the venue. Add to that the fact that it's an outdoor show in October in Montreal? I'll pray that the music gods look kindly on us and spare us the rain or temperatures hovering around Zero. Portishead will put cartoon stars and hearts in my eyes. Les Quais du Vieux-Port, not so much.",2,7/15/2011,Mark H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XWGipvcfbAs6LA0uuf_EAw,"Montreal, Canada"
86,"good place to walk around and get some fresh air, a few cute gardens and churches to wander into. very touristy and thus over-priced gift shops and mediocre-looking restaurants. lots of bugs and a few interesting offerings like the labyrinth and cirque du soleil.",3,6/15/2010,Jasmine W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5p7fIgmWgP6yWdqJbSrlig,"South Pasadena, CA"
87,"Fabulous area of town to walk through - don't forget your camera. Unlike any ""old"" or historic part of any city in Canada (that I've been in anyway... Victoria, Vancouver, Toronto... I'm not sure if any part of Calgary is old...). An amazing feel to this area of Montreal, and lots of places to eat or drink coffee.",5,8/16/2008,Jay D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IBaDaTxp2yC_-AD2QscBOA,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
88,"Easily my favorite part of Montreal.The old stone buildings and narrow cobblestone streets give you that very quaint feel of walking through an old European village.The cafes provide plenty of opportunity for people watching while sipping on coffee or chomping down on your croques-monsieurs. If you manage to get a patio seat at one the restaurants on Place Jacques-Cartier you can even take in a show presented to you by street performers.Art lovers can give their wallets a good workout at any of the many galleries that line up along Rue Notre-Dame.The Basilica Notre-Dame is a must see for only $5 and for another $5 you can catch the light show which I hear is very beautiful.If you tire of walking there are horse carriages waiting to whisk you away on a tour of the old town, the car drivers stuck behind it won't enjoy it so much however. :)There is so much more to do, including the old port, but the above is a good start.",5,8/12/2008,Roger G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y7KCDbDjtQy-Xr2IBeUWJQ,"Washington, DC"
89,"When you walk the cobble stoned streets of Old Montreal, you feel like you are walking down a European street. So beautiful, so quaint and is a must for any person visiting Montreal. Great dining in the area.",5,8/6/2008,Andy K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hGeXKYWkqJgFC1u_Sh6kCg,"East Brunswick, NJ"
90,"Lots to do, some of it touristy some of it just plain fun.Best thing besides just walking around and people watching was  the paddleboats at the basin bonsecours.  We went in the evening towards sunset and it was just a peaceful and fun way to watch all the activity of the port and still relax and be on the water.Great for couples or even families with kids, lifejackets available but not mandatory.  about $17 canadian gets you 30 minutes, but they didn't really enforce it so you don't have to watch the clock.",4,6/29/2010,R G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B9tP6dq8ZyXCrgI7RKlMpg,"Melrose, MA"
91,Very cool spot to check out. Lots of nice eateries in the area. We were fortunate to stumble over here on Canada. There were tons of activities to do.,4,7/3/2011,Lenny Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RRsbPGYyKJ3zqMMkzcHZaQ,"Los Angeles, CA"
92,"We thoroughly enjoyed our vacation to Montreal and this was the high point of the trip.  Pedestrian friendly, abundance of cafes, nicely landscaped, lovely shops filled with French linens, soaps, ceramics, etc. Striking, old buildings, gorgeous river views and lots of points of interest. As many have probably said, for North Americans, Vieux Montreal is a European experience w/o the jet lag.",5,7/4/2011,Jill L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2T1zzzZnLajKsgB5AaSq4w,"Austin, TX"
93,"Old Montreal is my favorite part of the city. If you like to view or purchase art for your home, love small coffee shops or even a good bar then this part of the city is the place for you to check out. There are the touristy spots there but the old feel of the city has not been lost there. Check out the City museum located near the water front. If you are staying downtown take a taxi or walk to the old city. Parking in this area is hard to find especially in the evening and weekends.",4,5/24/2010,David B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=svIdwzMXUNDXWjfuMGMezw,"West Newton, MA"
