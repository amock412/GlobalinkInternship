1,"Ideal for cycling, skating and running! They have lockers, indoor tables and coffee machines.",5,8/13/2015,Kamy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fiKR50Wxuu-6YzuotTeRnA,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"I have discovered a deep vein of neglected yelping here for myself as I seem to have neglected a bunch of my favourite parks! Fun fact about me, I didn't learn to ride a bike properly until I was in my 20s, and only then did I finally get out to really explore some of the incredible bike paths in our city, which have only been getting more and more exceptional in recent years. One awesome ride is to connect the big downtown parks, looping around from the mountain, laurier, la fontaine and then our here to Maisonneuve. Maisonneuve is realllllllly fun to bike, it's a great big green expanse with gorgeous paths, you really feel simultaneously so free and quite protected from cars and things - perfect if you're still gaining comfort as a biker. You can get up close and personal with that weird icon of architecture, the Big O, and there's stadiums tucked near by where you can watch some of the best Roller Derby bouts (when they reopen, le sigh!) If you're out enjoying the parks, just maintain that 2 meter safety zone and bring your mask and we can all help each other feel a little more safe in these bonkers times.",4,6/30/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
3,"This is the giant park next to the old olympic stuff.  It looks like they took all of that area and decided to turn it into green space.  The only problem with this area is the parking.  There really isn't any free parking to enjoy the park.  So end up having to pay for parking.  But once you have, there is a LOT of space for you you to hike and enjoy the outdoors.",4,5/9/2017,David N.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CQUDh80m48xnzUkx-X5NAw,"Houston, TX"
4,"It's a great place to go jogging, biking or rollerblading or just to enjoy a beautiful summer day.  There are separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians which is smart although sometimes someone ends up on the path they shouldn't be on.  Overall though I love this place.",4,7/30/2013,Julia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,"Montreal, Canada"
5,"Giant green space, some riding trails.  Great place to be during a hot summer day.",4,6/6/2011,Susanne J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4yJmm_dsTGX1DfxaPCxxgw,"Vancouver, Canada"
