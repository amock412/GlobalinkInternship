1,"I'm not a language person (only knowing Bonjour and Merci) but I picked up 3 French words while walking the streets of Montreal and 1 while sitting shotgun on the car ride here.  Rue = Street, Vieux = Old, Place = Plaza, and Arret = Stop.  (We also learned how to pronounce Rue Saint Urbain from a bus driver.)Place Jacques-Cartier is a very lively PLAZA in the heart of Old Montreal.  It's the perfect spot for people watching, especially if you're sitting at one of the outdoor dining areas on the sides.  Street performers and tour groups can also be found here.  If you walk towards Saint Lawrence River, you'll be near the piers (Old Port), which is just as lively.",4,6/3/2016,Jing X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A08xF_ykmsWQV0ypYA8wkA,"Brooklyn, NY"
2,"Place Jacques-Cartier is a square between rue Notre-Dame and rue de la Commune in the Old Montreal section. It is a somewhat steep street which at the top has a replica of the Admiral Horatio Nelson statue, the original was removed in 1997. This is the area where the gardens of the Chateau Vaudreuil  once stood in 1723. The square was named in 1847 after Jacque- Cartier, the explorer who claimed Canada for the French crown.Today, Place Jacques-Cartier is lined with restaurants, shops and auberges. Street artists and kiosks are visible during the summer while lighted trees decorate the Christmas season. The street has classical Parisian style terraces. The oldest restaurant, Saint Amable lies in this area. An original piece of the historic fortress wall of Montreal can be found in the basement of Auberge du Vieux-Port.. The side streets host an assortment of craft shops, boutiques and restaurants. It is a car-free pedestrian zone.",3,3/12/2021,Anton K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x3WbWavd0SzjJsvmkvgqUg,"Montville, NJ"
3,"Place Jacques-Cartier in Old Montreal has its charm in different seasons. But of course it is the prettiest during springs and summers when all the flowers are blooming.Numerous bistro and bars lining up both side of the Square with outside patio area.There are also live entertainment: performers, musicians, stand up comedians and more.Quite enjoyable for an after dinner stroll.",4,8/31/2015,Jennifer K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CxDOIDnH8gp9KXzpBHJYXw,"Markham, Canada"
4,"As another Yelper mentioned, this square lies in the heart of Old Montreal.  It runs from Hotel De Ville (City Hall) to to the waterfront.Usually, this spot gets very busy.  The afternoon that we were here, it was raining and nothing happening.  Bad luck on our part.  Normally, it is a great place to people watch and see street artists performing.  Also, their would be vendors set up at their stalls ready to sell you something.Oh well, maybe next time.  I am still a fan, though.",4,6/16/2015,PatrickJ T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,"Bakersfield, CA"
5,"At the heart of Old Montreal, in front of the infamous Hotel de Ville, sits Place Jacques Cartier as the doorway to this gorgeous area of our city. The pedestrian walkway, lined with restaurants, booths, and cute little gift shops, makes way to the cobblestone streets and nooks of the old city where you can easily spend the day. I still love playing tourist in my own city; mingling with the visitors or grabbing a drink on a terrace is part of the charm of this square. Either way, there is always something happening here so go on and explore!",5,8/25/2017,Konstantina P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada"
6,"Yesterday while visiting Old Montreal and the Old Ports we walked through Place Jacques-Cartier as we wandered through the area. When we arrived at Jacques it was still a bit early in the day so the area wasn't as busy as it could have been, but that being said we enjoyed looking through the shops in the area and additionally loved looking at some of the street vendors who had arrived for the day.Overall, Jacques is an incredible area in Old Montreal and it has a great view of the waterfront. It is definitely a must see when in the area and the next time we visit we hope that it is during their ""on season"" and not the ""off season"" as was this time around.",4,10/9/2015,Dan R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JTVSbPB1EjjMu05JwWCP3A,"East Falmouth, MA"
7,"This square lies in the heart of Old Montreal, bordered on the north and south by the waterfront and City Hall. It's a vibrant, beautiful area, filled with outdoor terraces and bistros and cafes, paved in cobblestones and populated by artisans and musicians. There are narrow old alleyways off the central square, filled with photographers and painters and jewelers selling their wares. There are ivied courtyard restaurants and, yes, the usual array of touristy shops selling local tchotchkes.There's nothing better than having a glass of sangria at a table outside in the summertime here, watching the chic Montrealers and all the tourists go by. And in e evening, there are some nice clubs and restaurants to visit. Old Montreal is my favorite part of Montreal, and this old square is truly its heart.",5,8/10/2013,Nancy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,"Vancouver, Canada"
