1,"I don't come to this park often but I really should. Recently, I took a stroll here around 9pm and it was so pleasant. There were a bit of bugs but nothing too major. I was lucky enough to see a family of ducks! The cutest thing!!",5,7/23/2018,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada"
2,"Big parc , many places for picnic, for sport, a nice fountain, path for bike and trees to get some shadow.",4,5/28/2020,Pat M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,"Montreal, Canada"
3,"Though not grand like Mont Royal, Parc Jarry had the charm of a quaint, beautiful local urban park. Equipped with everything from baseball field, tennis courts to basketball fields and featuring an interweaving trail throughout the entire park, this is a popular spot for runners, bikers and various sport enthusiasts to practice their skills. During the first days of spring, the park is alive with squirrels scurrying up trees and playful ducks on the lake. Sitting on the benches relaxing while people watching is a pleasure within itself.A mini urban paradise.",4,5/17/2014,Sharon Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BnywXOmsaeNYIKJQWaQIlQ,"Foster City, CA"
4,"Important update: I now love the pool here. They added fencing to extend the pool-side sitting area beyond the hot concrete so you can lie on the grass under a tree between dippings. There is always a breeze here, and the pool is always free. Magique.",5,8/1/2012,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
5,"I went for a run through here on my recent trip to Montreal.  I was staying close by, so I also ran the 5 blocks to/from the park.  It has plenty of paths and sidewalks, as well as a large pond and fountain.  There's a decently sized hill and a small wooded area you can run through.  There are also tennis courts, basketball courts, a hockey rink, soccer fields, a baseball field, and lots of grassy areas for laying out in the sun.  There was also a swimming pool, but it was closed :(I thoroughly enjoyed my run through here, despite its brevity.",5,7/15/2015,Christopher J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-V7frksbFjKQYVhrPnnlPw,"Lake Terrace, New Orleans, LA"
6,"The most lovely park I visited in Montreal! I was completely in love with the lake and its ducks, the willow trees and the tables underneath them. It felt so romantic, even though it's a relatively small park. The lake water wasn't weirldly green (thank god) and the ducks looked healthy. Bonus points for non-polluted nature! There's lots of spots where to sit, on the rocks across the lake, on the tables, on the grass... The pool at the park is awesome too.",4,10/6/2013,Anna C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A5FnteBcoOCdydcHxgpfIw,"Montreal, Canada"
7,"Love, love, love Parc Jarry; it's super close to Little Italy so loading up pre-BBQ is easy peasy and the people watching is fine. Skip across the rocks and enjoy chilling on the little island but don't drink too much beer as the hike to find the washroom is a tad far.",5,6/19/2012,Janine T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,"Montreal, Canada"
8,"nice enough park to walk through.  much more interesting when there is a tennis tournament, or  event.",3,8/12/2016,Alf O.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TmljCl6px9_1D-V1dEUR-w,"Long Island City, NY"
9,I love this park simply because it's close to home and during the spring summer and fall you can catch a soccer game here at almost any time.,5,8/1/2012,Edgar M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KIBnDrvylvrvhr4Ow6OIAw,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Canada"
