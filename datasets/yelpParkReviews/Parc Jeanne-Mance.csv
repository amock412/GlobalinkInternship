1,The little park in front of Mount Royal. I had always thought this park was a part of Mount Royal until about 2 years ago when I noticed the yelp page. This is where they host the Indian festival.I great little spot to have a picnic or play a game of tennis/soccer.,5,7/23/2018,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada"
2,"A perfect and beautiful spot chosen for festival of India in Montreal. This park is exactly across the Mont Royal Park. It's beautiful and huge enough for playgrounds for children and sport field are all present. The festival of India of itself was an average affair. I was excepting more as Indian person. One of the best part is free feast for everyone; the line up was huge. It is very well know, India as country is multicultural as itself (north/south/west/east), and multi religion (Hindu mainly, with Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian). This festival was promoting the Hindu religion more than showing the culture of India by the performances (religious chants; selling religious books and clothes). There were few activities that were neutral as henna tattoo booth, gift shops, spices shops...Hopefully, in coming years, the festival will better and improved.",3,7/7/2018,Shahanaz B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada"
3,Its a perfect place to have lunch at my brake. Lot of picnic tables under the shade. Different kind of people's. Always quiet,4,7/10/2019,JOzé G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HXDNpRnyAn5qYHIbpK1R5w,"Montreal, Canada"
4,"Nice little park that is well taken care of.Large lawn area for picnics with some tables set up.Get your sweat on with the tennis and volleyball courts.Take a seat by the monument, take in some sun, and watch the traffic go by.Just a good park to kick back in, lay out, take a nap, or throw around the frisbees.Also, we did not notice one piece of trash, wrappers, or bottles on the ground. Well done.",4,7/13/2016,Phil H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,"New York, NY"
5,"If you are going to chill or play sports nothing is more a quintessential Montreal location than Parc Jean-Mance. It has everything though we come here most often for Soccer or Tennis. The Tennis courts over looks the mountain and the cross so it is PICTURE PERFECT. Be smart if you're playing seriously make sure to not be distracted and face away from the mountain -lol. The tennis courts are reasonably priced, especially if you have a ""Montreal Carte Acess"" and they are in pretty good condition. The Soccer turf field is artificial and in very good shape - perfect for Football or Soccer",4,6/5/2016,Denzil D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,"Montreal, Canada"
6,"The original picnic park, we used to meet here along the Esplanade side between the tennis courts and the soccer field where you could sit at picnic tables, bring a bbq and cooler and enjoy the brief warmer summer evenings. People who live in the beautiful brightly-coloured old stone homes that line the park bring out tablecloths and cutlery and lamps and paper decorations for next level outdoor eating. The lower part of the park has the beach volleyball courts, and the west side of the park is where the ""mountain"" begins... but that's a whole other Yelp review.",4,8/1/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
7,"Love this park! With the mountain perched up on the other side of the street, the excellent sports facilities, and pick-up ultimate frisbee games, it's the perfect spot to get your exercise, or just lay back, have a picnic (good spread of picnic tables), and do some people watching. In winter it features a hockey rink, and still nice to walk through.",5,6/25/2016,Offer R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada"
8,"This park is full of life because it serves the needs of many different kids of people. On the evening I arrive, people are drumming near the statues overlooking the park. Mostly young people grooving on the beat, their own dancing, or just the pleasure of spontaneous music and crowds.The park is a perfect model of integrating passive (lying in the sun, enjoying a picnic, smooching) and active (soccer, football tossing, cycling) recreation. The are also spaces for practical functions, such as community composting.Encouraging passive recreation is especially important in an area dominated by apartments and flats; enjoying Nature without an activity in mind is just what a crowded downtown area needs lots of. Many things illegal in parks are tolerated. The fragrance of marijuana is commonplace. So are fruit ke bobs, from vendors who are chased out of most  public parks.I would say that if pot is tolerated (as it should be in moderation), the same should go for vending of healthy foods and beverages -- an argument I make in my e-book Food for City Building.Parks such as this are ideal places to support healthy food artisans who enhance the multiple functions of a dynamic urban people park.",4,6/30/2014,Wayne R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kELk-PTS46BdY8vWxnOwRA,"Toronto, Canada"
9,"This is the park to go if you LOVE outdoor activities. You can do it all here, from soccer to tennis. All that's missing is a basketball hoop and you have yourself a fully equipped outdoors gym. And during Sundays there is a sea of people on Mount-Royal that are taking some vitamin D. Jeanne-Mance park is the ideal kick-it spot for everyone.",5,8/4/2012,Edgar M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KIBnDrvylvrvhr4Ow6OIAw,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Canada"
