1,"Parc Mont Royal is a great place in every season. The tobogganing slope at the corner of Cote-Ste-Catherine and Parc might look tame from afar, but the ride is certainly speedy and bumpy enough to get the adrenalin flowing - a little bit. No wonder it is teaming with youngsters as well as young-at-hearts during the winter weekends. Grab your magic carpet and give it a go! Btw, it is free, but you have to bring your own toboggan. If you don't own one, the tubing slopes close to Lac Castor provide a nice alternative. For a few dollars you get access to an inner tube and lanes to slide down - all day long. Friendly helpers at the top of the slope will give you a push and a spin, and off you go! Minimum age is 4 years. A nice mug of hot chocolate to warm those frozen fingers is available at the Lac Castor cafeteria and gear rental. Outdoor enthusiasts can rent snowshoes, skis and skates here at reasonable prices, too.When fun in the snow is so easily accessible, there is no excuse to spend winter indoors!",5,2/11/2012,Madita A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WVzff6WDqhqksu8pkVZvFQ,"Montreal, Canada"
