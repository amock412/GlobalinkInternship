1,"Jean-Paul Riopelle square is one of my favourite places in Montreal. It is in fact little park with numerous benches surrounded by new buildings and brightened by the colourful windows of Palais des Congres. Whether you come from Old Montreal or China Town you would be surprised by the feeling of freshness and contrasting modernity. What is really outstanding about this square is the fountain of the famous Montreal born artist Jean-Paul Riopelle: La Joute. You can read about its history yourself in Wikipedia: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/…, just don't forget to see it with your own eyes. It is beautiful!",5,8/29/2014,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada"
2,"Place Jean-Paul Riopelle is a public space that is built on a former parking lot.  It's located between the new entrance to the Palais des congres and of the CDP Capital Centre.  This little gem of a park is found in DT Montreal at crossroads of busy intersections; however, a great little spot to sit and read a book, relax your feet for a while, or to just people-watch, as there are plenty of benches and trees for shade.  During the evenings, there are lights that light up the park.  Don't forget to check out the sculpture-fountain by Riopelle called 'La Joute,' which is part of a fountain that runs a 30-minute spectacle between mid-May through mid-October.+plenty of benches and trees+ 'La Joute' fountain - 30-minute 'performance' offered from mid-May-mid-October",4,4/1/2016,Hannah H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,"Alexandria, VA"
