1,"Such a massive park! We have our annual our Respiratory Therapy department BBQ here. Every August, a Saturday, we come super early to reserve the BBQ spot. Plenty of parking spots, tons of picnic tables. We bring tons of food, drinks and games... and make perfect day of it! Rain or Shine... we go on. If it rains, we got ourselves covered by a tarp. It rained once, one year, and we were holding the tarp over our heads... it was awesome! A perfect spot to picnic with family, colleagues and friends!",5,5/11/2018,Shahanaz B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada"

3,"Huge park with lots of plain air and space for picnic. But it doesn't have slides,  playgrounds and other amusements, you have to bring your toys.",4,8/13/2015,Kamy D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fiKR50Wxuu-6YzuotTeRnA,"Montreal, Canada"

5,"This is a great urban park that has suffered in the recent economy and been forced to shutter a few of the more unique but costly activities ie; the little farm / petting zoo area where we used to take the camp kids, and the old Fort. Still you're looking at over 200 acres of land, mostly forest, and hundreds of community garden plots. Here recently for the inspiring and humbling Walk So Kids Can Talk I got a quick ATV tour of the park limits, including the big bordering streets (oh my!) and enjoyed the 5km walk past ponds, sweeping willows, meditative tai chi groups, and the incredibly convenient metro stop that drops you off sweetly right at the park's grassy doorstep. It made me feel glad to live in a city where bits of green space are still cherished by local residents and protected by the powers that be, I hope that remains the case even in the face of economic change and challenges. Note that this area, especially around the metro, is a little barren in terms of local business, and not always safe at night.",3,5/7/2012,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
