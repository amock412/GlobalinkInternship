1,"Very lovely park to escape too when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, without having to go to far. There's a lovely pond you could sit by and have a picnic or just to hang out and have a chat with some friends. There's different paths you could walk on within the park. At night it gets lite up with beautiful English style lamps; it gives you the feels like you're in England or something. I find it very ""bougie"" looking park, you could definitely tell your in westmount. Pets are welcome, just make sure you clean up after them or else you could get hit with a $300 fine. I enjoy spending time here.",5,7/23/2016,Claudia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,"Montreal, Canada"
2,"I can't believe I've never been here before! Beatiful park centrally locates in the city. Lots of green spaces, bike paths, benches and ponds with the cutest resident ducks. It was busy when I was there on a Saturday but possible to keep your distance with others. They have public bathrooms on locations. Unfortunately, they were pretty messy. The park is well-maintained and is perfect for relaxing afternoon. I will definitely be visiting here again",4,8/16/2020,Sam P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,"Ottawa, Canada"
3,"I've been going for about 30 years.It's absolutely beautiful.   Feed the ducks, bring a picnic lunch and relax for the day.The neighbourhood is absolutely wonderful - peaceful, perfect for taking pictures and quiet.Bring the kids, bring the dogs, bring your friends, bring a book....just go  :-)",5,6/29/2016,Leesa-Catherine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yML2P1evj7FrLncIgaFzHw,"Montreal, Canada"
4,"This is one of the most serene and beautiful parks in the city which is close to the city center but not quite. The pond, the small waterfall, the cobble-stone paths, the library (now over 100 years old), the green spaces, the variety of huge, mature trees which give plenty of shade, you can easily pick up lunch on the go on Sherbrooke street and come over and spend an afternoon here spread out on a blanket, either chilling out with a great friend or a great book.There's also a great dog part which will allow you to see some very interesting breeds since this is Westmount after all.",5,5/25/2017,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada"
5,"Nice little park , litlle lake , beaucoup d'ombre des arbres, some free shows in the summer and coffee place at southside of the park. Also the public library is on the westside of park.",3,10/18/2016,Pat M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,"Montreal, Canada"
6,"A great park to hang out, it has something for everyone. There are plenty of winding walking trails, a pond, water fountain small children can play in, some soccer fields, a swing set area, a library and a community centre. In the summer this is a great place to see Shakespeare in the park. There are also family community events during the year held here",5,3/27/2016,Kevin W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U2OPJc9c1q7VToeKeTZ-UA,"Westmount, Canada"
7,"This much-loved and used park has been around since my grandparents' day - and I suspect even longer, actually. Bordered by Sherbrooke and St. Catherine on its north and south, it's in walking distance of the Westmount shops on these streets, and even on Greene and Victoria as well. This park has everything you'd want in a park, and more: a fountain and kiddie playground equipment? Check. Many elegant benches by stately trees? Check. A small man-made ""creek"" and larger grassy areas for kids to run around and play, or for picnics? Check. Meandering paths to walk, and an abundance of birds and squirrels to observe? Check!What makes this park of particular significance (other than its location and longstanding history) is the wealth of resources here: the elegant, old Westmount Library is located on the park's western side, as is its connected, gorgeous Victorian glass greenhouse. On the far south edge of the park by St. Catherine are the tennis courts and Westmount pools and indoor ice skating and hockey rinks (note: a new Westmount sport center is presently under construction, so there is a lot of building going on right now. But this sporting center, according to the plans and pictures I've seen, looks like it it's going to be pretty darn amazing, with a children's pool in addition to a lap pool, and other modern amenities).  There might be a new doggie are to the park, too, once all the construction is done. I like seeing all the kids in the park, and many summer day camps bring their young campers here to play. It's always vibrant, with the sounds of children laughing, and older folks sitting on benches and chatting with friends. Young and old alike visit this park regularly, as they have through many Montreal family's generations. It's everything a park should be.",5,8/11/2013,Nancy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,"Vancouver, Canada"
8,Westmount Park is a great place to come on a sunny day to get some fresh air.  When I lived downtown I used to always make sure my morning runs passed through this park because I just love it.  There is plenty of green space to sit and enjoy the weather and a big pond for scenery.  You can also enjoy a leisurely stroll through the winding paths that go through this park.  For the kids there are fountains to play in come summer time and swing sets too.  For the athletes there are tennis courts and a soccer field where you can work up a sweat.  I believe they also do Shakespeare in the park here but you might want to double check that one.  Anyways to wrap things up this park is definitely a good place to come on a nice day to get out and make the most of the weather.,5,4/3/2016,Julia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,"Montreal, Canada"
