1,"Love this park !Even tho I'm not a kid the park still has picini table to chill out at, picnic or ice cream.If you do have kids note that this park has the water park thats perfect for hot summer days. There's water fountain as well so don't worry you'll be fine out there.Park closes at 11 and that means the water turns off as well, so there's no sneaking in after hours for a late night soak lol.Love this spot",5,6/23/2017,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada"
