1,Lovely park with pond surrounding it. It becomes a skating rink in the winter. There's a grocery store nearby so it's great for picnics and diners outside. Very nice for lounging around and reading. There's a kids park near as well.,4,5/11/2016,Justine S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,"Outremont, Canada"
2,"I went there for a photoshoot. The place itself looks nice. It has a bridge, a big pavilion, bathrooms, benches, a tennis court and a little ""river"".The place is really clean and well maintained. Also, it's really quiet and there's not a lot of people However, the paint on the pavilion and the bridge is chipped in a lot of places. Overall, nice park!",3,8/19/2017,Shiyue X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,"Montreal, Canada"
