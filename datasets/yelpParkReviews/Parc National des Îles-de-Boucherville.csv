1,"Montreal's best kept National Park secret only minutes away from downtown Montreal and worth the trip. Park is accessible by ferry or car, and once there you can rent bikes or kayaks. Bike rentals are about $30 so if you bring your own, you will save some money. Check Park Entrance Fee, but I think it was about $8 per person and totally worth it. They do an excellent job of maintaining this park.Absolutely beautiful setting that one cannot believe is only minutes from Montreal.You can bike between the 3 islands, and there are beautiful quiet spots en route to picnic, or just relax in the hammocks. Their new welcome center is beautiful and a great stop for food, water, bathrooms  or just AC.The bike and kayak rental is directly across.My only complaint here and at most national parks is WHY a country that loves the outdoors and animals - does not allow us to bring our dogs with us on the hike.",5,7/25/2018,A A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-Yb1srF4RYtpn-6Yp8ojRg,"New York, NY"
2,"First of all the ferry to the Boucherville Islands park is ridiculously cute and I love it. It's a small bike ferry, a short ride on the water over to a peaceful haven blowing with tall grasses. We biked here from out in Mile End so after a hectic ride through the city, arriving on this island was heaven. It's deeply peaceful and really really fun to ride around on, amazing bike paths rolling through quiet trees and protected, diverse nature. People are here fishing, walking, kayaking and generally relaxing. I didn't find any earth shattering views or anything like that, but a real sense of peace really close to the heart of the city.",4,8/21/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada"
3,Came to play frisbee golf. A great free course in a beautiful parc. Free parking too which is a bonus.,5,11/1/2020,Corey D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,"Brossard, Canada"
4,I went to the parc with friends on a day where the entrance was free. In the winter this parc isn't the most fabulous. I've been in the warmer months and there was much more to see and do. Great parc to spot Virginia deer.,3,1/30/2019,Virginia L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada"
