1,This place went from what the heck ? To va va voom!The whole park was re done from the benches to the new walk ways.There's always activities in the park mostly in the summer you'll have concerts or bbq's.There used to be lots of kids skateboarding but the signs up say they can't anymore since the new park. But it does have perfect skateboarding Ramps Iol,4,7/2/2017,Amber H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,"Montreal, Canada"
