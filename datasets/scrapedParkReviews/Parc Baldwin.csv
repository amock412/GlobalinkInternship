I could appreciate the arrival of the different seasons with the years, always moving. In summer, installed on my terrace of the first floor, I could enjoy the park as if it were my own garden. The dinners (suppers) taken outside were soft and fresh thanks to the imposing foliage of the trees that tickled the terraces of the houses.
I remember one day in the early autumn when I took the air on one of his benches; a young man played the cello. The sound of his music spread like a charm on the park. I approached him and talked to each other when he stopped playing. He had just made me discover in this haven of peace the ""Suites for cello alone Bach"". We became friends.
I also remember a great couscous we had, my friends and I, tasted on a huge Quebec flag some June 24th.

Les dîners (soupers) pris dehors étaient doux et frais grâce à l'imposant feuillage des arbres qui venaient chatouiller les terrasses des maisons.
Je me souviens d'un jour au début de l'automne où je prenais l'air sur un de ses bancs; un jeune homme jouait du violoncelle. Le son de sa musique se répandait comme un charme sur le parc. Je me suis approché de lui et nous nous sommes parlés quand il a cessé de jouer. Il venait de me faire découvrir dans ce havre de paix les ""Suites pour violoncelle seul de Bach"". Nous sommes devenus amis.
Je me souviens aussi d'un super couscous que nous avions, mes amis et moi, dégusté sur un immense drapeau québécois un certain 24 juin.
