With views of the St Lawrence River and the historic canals, i recently spent some time photographing its' character using a modified camera. Whether you come for exercise or relaxation, the Park has many amenities and is accompanied by exceptional views."

Has outstanding view to the river. You can watch the beautiful sunset. You are free to barbecue and have fun with your family. It is a good place for ridding bicycle, exercising, running, playing skate and etc. It is one of my favourite place to visit."

It’s a great bike path around the island and river family friendly.

Not too many outdoor park games for kids"
