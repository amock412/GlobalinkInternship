For safety of young children, the playground area is totally enclosed. Inside are face to face benches and  sandbox. At one corner, there is an interactive board too. The park highlighted the importance of social interaction, communication and security. Actually, park built with this traditional concept are hard to find now.
This little park is the one to help grow and develope the children in the right way."
