The play structures are great for older kids but for the little ones I feel like they could install another ""classic"" play structure with slides and tubes. Space is certainly not an issue. Splash pad is nice but entirely shaded. Would have been great to have only the seating area shaded. The pond in the park is great when paddle boats can be used (closed for now due to covid). The park has a rink (just renovated) and 2 baseball fields but I have not used them yet to give feedback. Most importantly 5 stars for the ppl who visit the park (most at least ;))"
