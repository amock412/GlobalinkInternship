2,Île de Roxboro,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLeTlxN21BRRAB,Desmond Yu,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117459513371066762683/reviews?hl=en-CA,2 months ago,2021-06-20 21:49:52.289956,5.0,115,"This is another world, if you live in a city and arrived at this island which is just a few hundred feet from a main Street.
The island is hidden from street view until you arrived. Plenty of hardwood trees. You passed a gate crossing a bridge , then you are inside the forest. No more city in sight or city noise.
If you keep going straight, you will find a river at the north end. You can see the Laval at the other side.
You are now in a piece of natural forest by a river, all by yourself.
Think about anything you want to see in a country, Canada goose, duck and all kinds of birds, if you stay, they will come and visit you.
By the end of the island at the west side, there are even bicycle parking.
Park your bike and have a walk by the river bank if it fits you well.
I love it so much."
