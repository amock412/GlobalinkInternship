Not much for kids to do, not much space to play, located by the tracks and lachine's industrial district.

This would function a lot better as a dog park in my personal opinion but I doubt we'd ever see that again. Here's hoping the change will eventually get made"

Looks lovely, after the decontamination,  done at the expense of tax payers...     This park is perfect because nobody uses it...   it is brand new, and i can say was transformed from a dirt pile into a park.
this park was planted after they cleaned up a toxic waste site left  by the builders.  see CHARBANNEAU COMMISION
the residents want their DOG PARK back.
I can say as a resident of 15 years from this local area, Pominville is a very nice enclave of about 100 town homes,  built i believe in 2011

*past notable events.   THE MOVIE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2 WAS FILMED AT THIS LOCATION BEFORE THE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT HERE

THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS A TOXIC WASTE SITE SINCE THE GLASS FACTORY BURNT TO THE GROUND IN THE LATE 70s

I CAN SEE THIS ENTIRE LOCATION FROM MY 2nd STORY WINDOW

JEAN CLAUSE VAN DAMES WAS HERE"
