It is flat and wide, and has some nice but sparse trees. It is crisscrossed by many foot paths, and is traversed by the Lachine canal bicycle path. Dogs are allowed on a leash, but not only during the daytime. It’s a wide part of the otherwise narrow public lakefront strip that spans almost all of the burrow of Lachine’s lakefront. This strip exists thanks to the old city of Lachine that had a policy to return the banks of lac St-Louis to the citizens.  There is a war memorial statue, dedicated “To our Soldier” at the top end. This 1925 piece by Alfred Laliberté was recently moved here by the burrow of Lachine, which is somewhat fitting considering that during the first world war, this park was used as a depot for military horses in transit to the European battlefields."
