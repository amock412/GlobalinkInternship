It's clean. A lot of garden spaces where you can easily practice distancing (2020) and do picnic. The splash pad is big and clean enough. However, just be careful by letting the kids run barefoot, it is slippery in a couple of spots.
This park has a lot of sport activities to do. It has 2 large soccer fields, 2 baseball fields, you can see some goalies around the park so you can practice with a couple of friends. It's playground is clean and large for small (with sand) and another for big kids. It has a track throughout the park. It is a cool place to spend Summer and even Fall. In Winter there's a lot of snow and I've seen some people skiing throughout the park too.
The parking is always easy and free."
