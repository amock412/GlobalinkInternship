Great venue for a comedy show, it held a few thousand people max and the sound was clear and crisp. The area was surrounded with many stations for children of all ages to keep everyone busy. Not sure if it's always like this, or because the JFL's was in town, regardless it was a beautiful place to enjoy our evenings."
