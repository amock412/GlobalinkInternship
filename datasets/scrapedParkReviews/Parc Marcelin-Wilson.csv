The park is divided into two sections separated by Henri-Bourassa Blvd. The first section has basketball and tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, indoor ice-skating arena, outdoor swimming pool and a small skating park. In January 2021, a pond has frozen forming an outdoor ice skating field. The second and smaller section has a track for walking and relaxing. Both sections have a playground for small children, benches and areas for picnic."

It has a small skate park, a football field, a basketball field, a baseball field, a tennis terrain, an ice-skating rink and a pool (olympic + baby + water games). It also has two spots for children to play with slides and such and to even play with some musical instruments as well. It has a cute little bridge and some “cultural” spots for Phoenicians. It is also like any other park: green with benches and picnic tables. Almost in the middle, there is a big empty space that one can be creative with. It doesn’t end there! There is a forest with several entrances! It’s like one moment you’re in the street, the other you’re lost in some interesting and mysterious place coming out of a movie. I explored most of it, but I didn’t go deep into the “forest” because it was beginning to get dark. I am totally in love with this place. Almost forgot: there’s also a community garden (and maybe a museum, I am not really sure about the museum because I didn’t check it out)."

Don’t get me wrong I love the green spaces but can we use them. There are so many parts of this park that are just never used. Can they put at least walking paths through them and if you venture through them beware of dog poop. There are a lot of dogs in this neighbourhood why not give them a fenced in area
