There are also wooded trails for walking however I did find it extremely buggy since there is several water sources around and perfect breeding grounds for these hungry little pests."

ACCESS: Great for getting to by car, bus or metro, bike or walking. Angrignon Metro Station adjacent as well as bus routes. There are two parking lots. The south one accessible from La Verandrye is less busy and free.

SIZE: Big for a city park. Plenty of walkways & trails, big space so you don't feel everyone is ever bunched together.

NATURE: Lots of trees and a lake. You can find squirrels, many types of birds and if you're lucky a few other animals as well. Seasonal native flowers, plenty of shade.

SERVICES: Public bathrooms, benches (although many are out in the sun) , a dog park for dogs to play & run around in and there used to be a snack bar in the main building which decades ago was a small zoo (there was even an elephant in the 1980s!)

WHEN TO GO: Year-round. In winter it's a good nature walk, skating on the lake and beats being indoors. In spring lots of new buds & flowers, you see a lot of photographers taking pictures. Summer people sunbathe, walk around, bikeride, enjoy the sights near the lake. Fall is great for foliage, trees change colours.

RAINY DAYS: If you ever take a walk in a rainy day you will see a lot of animals because they are less bothered by people.

All in all a great place to enjoy nature in the city as this is one of Montreal's largest green spaces and easily accessible in any way."

Nice park. It's well kept and clean. There is a nice forest, but also has open spaces as well. There is also a decent size pond/lake with a path all the way around. Part of the path was made a path while some are unofficial paths. If you have children with you, you will probably want to stay on the official paths, because some of the paths near the lake are narrow and a child could easily fall into the water. The gardeners who work here are hard working and do a very good job maintaining this place. It's a nice break from the city, while being close by. Angrignon Metro Station is on the edge of the park, so it's easy to get to if you don't have a car. It has a parking lot and also street parking nearby. It's always enjoyable walking here.

This park is also great because its right when you get of the subway its right their. Also, since its Montreal, the sign is in French and there's no English to be found. C'mon Montreal put some English on your park signs, like its public place in Canada. I understood some but not all."

Angrignon Park is just a lovelier option, a moment to cherish, remember, and share. You will not regret the detour, plus it's free: bring a picnic basket, a banket to lie under the weeping willow by the water, and I promise that you will, just like we did, find yourself truly smiling, breathing again, grateful to be alive.

Because of the lake (big pond) and the enormous trees; this is one our favorite parks in the city to go for a walk in. This park is also incredibly large; in the winter we will frequently go snowshoeing here; its extremely peaceful in the winter.

Angrignon Park (French: Parc Angrignon) is a large park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. Angrignon Park has a total area of 97 hectares.
The park is named for Jean-Baptiste Angrignon (1875-1948), a longtime city councillor in C√¥te Saint-Paul.
The park was inspired by the design of 19th-century English gardens. The park contains 20,000 trees, winding paths and a pond surrounded by cattails.
The park is located just south of Ville-√âmard, east of Carrefour Angrignon, which is also named after Jean-Baptiste Angrignon, and west of Verdun.
En 1944, on projette d'am√©nager un zoo d'importance dans le parc. Dix ans plus tard, la firme am√©ricaine d'architectes paysagers et ing√©nieurs McFadzean, Everly and Associates √©labore un programme complet. Le zoo serait dot√© de b√¢timents √† l'architecture symbolique inspir√©e des esp√®ces animales. Sur ce terrain de 250 acres (plus de 100 hectares soit plus d'un km2), agr√©ment√© d'une s√©rie de bassins, les animaux donneraient l'impression de circuler en libert√©. Bien qu'il ne soit r√©alis√© qu'en partie, le zoo accueille, chaque hiver, les animaux du Jardin des merveilles du Parc Lafontaine jusqu'en 1989, alors qu'ils sont d√©finitivement relocalis√©s au moment de la fermeture du Jardin des merveilles."

Running?

The Angrignon Park is the place to visit.
It's very big and you never feel some body else is in your personal space.

So, next time you are in LaSalle (Montreal) Quebec, visit it.

Highly recommended if you want to do Zumba, picnic, yoga!

There is so much you can do!

Once you get off Metro Station Angrinon, you are right there!"
