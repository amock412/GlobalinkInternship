SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy."

Maybe its the time of the year that makes the difference. I took the metro to the place and the experience was ok. Its end of August and there was a light drizzle. The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.

A beautiful pond is in the middle decorated with a few fountains here and there.
During summer, there's usually a couple of activities/small festivals going on, so it's always worth a shot."

A bocce ball area. Baseball diamonds and a soccer field. Might be tennis courts too. The large pond is really nice in the summer. Theres a small amplitheater. Always something going on in this park. Great for a picnic or for a few evening beers with friends. I think the law is you can have beer or wine if you also have food. It's kind of like a mini central park in Montreal."

I don't advise taking a swim in the artificial lake since it's notoriously very dirty, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal! Other than that, feel free to eat your lunch there, or go biking. For a more impressive parc, visit the Mont Royal, or even the Parc Maisonneuve."

Despite the police station (pdq) 38 being across the street, it doesn't stop questionable crowds from discouraging people from going to squat for a picnic or a night walk.
