That's a lot to say for a Montreal park.

Edit: sorry for the security guard who will find my cabin. Started only by a day off in the park and ended up living in my cabin for 8 years. 1 days was rough but then i build my little shelter little by little. First it was only a roof, then i build a wall (big DT fan here), then i wanted a window so i build one. Then came the bathroom and washroom, then a couple of person came in so i built a group room, then had a vending machine company get some profit from my cabin and since came by i gave them water fountain. Now its a great little cabin located right in front of the Saputo stadium, on the other side of the street.
Still amazed i got away with it and it still secret to the authority. Hope nobody find it because its my little secret place. Come by if you want a quick drink or anything. Its open to everyone!"
