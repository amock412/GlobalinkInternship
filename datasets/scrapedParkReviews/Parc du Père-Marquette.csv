It's divided in three sections and the southernmost is separated by Boulevard Rosemont where cars tend to speed. Crossing lights will be a great way of improving safe access to the park.
Installations could be improved or used differently. Baseball diamond is a total waste of space.
Sliding slope could be made just a bit higher for greater fun during winter time.
What's good: playground for kids, football pitches (artificial), swimming pool (indoors), skate park and upcoming pataugeoire.
What's missing: trees & shade, picnic tables, trekfit installation (this is a must have for this park)."
