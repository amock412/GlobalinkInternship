When I get tired of shopping in the underground city or walking around Ste-Catherine, I find a bench and take a break. The square is situated north and south of Rene-Levesque Boulevard. Stick to the northern part for people-watching or go to the southern part if you prefer a less frequented area. There are several businesses east and west of the square, but some are in dilapidated buildings that could use a renovation."

It's one street.over from the VIa rail station and offers sunlight after darkness for so long. Beautiful tanning corners all over the place if all the benches are taken and was a nice spot to see a few historical buildings and monuments while waiting for the next train. Was interesting to see how the green color from the copper roofs leaked down the side of the building. Cannon was cool too and your close to the montreal Canadiens stadium too! Tonight is game 04 of the second series, there's a buzz in the air as a chance for the sweep looms!"

Ground is uneven it's like small tiles, but I find that's an advantage, though skatepark skaters probably will find the ride pretty bumpy, I recommend ditch wheels, but even park wheels are fine, just a bit slow.

Just my go-to skatepark near where I live...  Pretty chill crowd come here, too.  I like it...  *shrugs*"

This is an excellent work of my favorite landscape architect, Claude Cormier. In a Sunday afternoon at the beginning of Autumn the place was a perfect postcard: young families with strollers, tourists taking pictures and squirrels running and jumping around. The trees were showing hints of what is going to be their coloring in a few weeks time. A great place to start a downtown discovery walking tour."

It also happens to be the first Montreal cementary 1769 to 1865 it moved on the south west side of the glorious Mont-Royal! You will notice the crosses with a strange ending inbedded and strewn about the square. BTW there is a Victorian drinking fountain you can not miss it it is quite unique facing the neo classical Sunlife building it's hard to not see it.

One of my personal favorite things to do close to Dorchester square is to visit the Queen Elizabeth brunch on Sunday afternoons, trust me if you haven't experienced the brunch it's a total treat.

Saint Catherine Street is steps away from Dorchester square and an amazing place to go shopping and get your fix for designer brands and great deals on the strip."
