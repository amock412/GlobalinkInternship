Monument to Émilie Gamelin Designed and donated in 1999 by the sculptor Raoul Hunter, the monument to Émilie Gamelin is made of bronze and is 1,9 meters high. Mother Gamelin is shown stretched right hand carrying a basket of food for the needy of his time. The sculpture is not mounted on a pedestal, but on a human level, among passersby. She celebrates the bicentennial of her birth (February 19, 1800-2000) [4] .Gratte-ciel, waterfalls / streets, streams ... a construction Commissioned by the City of Montreal in 1992, the installation created by Melvin Charney is made of stainless steel, concrete, black granite ""Atlantic black"" from the region of Mégantic. At a height of 17 meters by 32 meters wide, the work consists of three towers supporting a series of inclined planes. From each of the towers flows a curtain of water that flows into a basin at the base of the towers. The overflow escapes along four gutters that are straddled by seven small bridges / passages delimited by granite walls. The course of these four streams ends in the four ponds leaning against the granite wall delimiting the mineral part of the square of its grassy area. The three cliffs / waterfalls evoke both the cliffs of Mount Royal and the skyscrapers of Montreal. Gutters and bridges reconstitute groundwater flowing from Mount Royal to the St. Lawrence River [5], [6].
As there is the jazz festival, I recently moved into this park and there was a circus facility and an outdoor cafe with music and a friendly atmosphere.

Monument à Émilie Gamelin Conçu et donné en 1999 par le sculpteur Raoul Hunter, le monument à Émilie Gamelin est fait de bronze et mesure 1,9 mètre de hauteur. Mère Gamelin est représentée main droite tendue portant un panier de vivres destiné aux nécessiteux de son temps. La sculpture n'est pas montée sur un socle, mais à hauteur humaine, parmi les passants. Elle célèbre le bicentenaire de sa naissance (19 février 1800-2000)[4].Gratte-ciel, cascades d'eau/rues, ruisseaux... une construction Commandée par la Ville de Montréal en 1992, l'installation créée par Melvin Charney est faite d'acier inoxydable, de béton, de granit noir «Atlantic black» de la région de Mégantic. D'une hauteur de 17 mètres sur 32 mètres de largeur, l'œuvre se compose de trois tours qui soutiennent une série de plans inclinés. De chacune des tours s'écoule un rideau d'eau qui se déverse dans un bassin situé à la base des tours. Le trop-plein s'évacue le long de quatre caniveaux chevauchés par sept petits ponts/passages délimités par des murets de granit. Le parcours de ces quatre ruisseaux prend fin dans les quatre bassins adossés au mur de granit délimitant la partie minérale de la place de son aire gazonnée. Les trois falaises/cascades évoquent à la fois les falaises du mont Royal et les gratte-ciel montréalais. Les caniveaux et les ponts reconstituent les eaux souterraines qui s'écoulent du mont Royal vers le fleuve Saint-Laurent[5],[6].
