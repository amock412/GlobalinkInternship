You can see people doing all sorts of events in the park and they even put up a lighted skating that I could see for my tall luxury high-rise at night time. Very well lit. With nobody there most of the time.  at the North end of the park and I don't know why that in particular late but it seems to have a lot of dog walking people.it's like a circle of dog socialization but not a dog run nobody releases their dog off the leash or they shouldn't. It's a popular Park surrounded by residential homes and generally speaking it's fairly quiet with homes and church and synagogue kitty-cornering it in a couple of places.  We need more parks and open spaces in Montreal so it's great to have this one.
