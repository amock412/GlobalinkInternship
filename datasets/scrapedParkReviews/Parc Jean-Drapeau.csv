It’s a great location for families on a picnic day trip, for amateurs, semi pro and professional bikers, joggers, lovers, or for those who love photography especially flowers macro photography.

It’s a one parc on 2 islands system and the beauty of it is that one can escape the city and its noise, cars, humans, Covid, literally just by crossing the bridge.

A wonderful location to spend hours enjoying nature, birds singing,  color change of our rivers as a factor of skies reflection, trees, greens, and of course my favorite, macro photography.

The sight is even absolutely breathtaking in the fall when leaves colors go from green to red and everything in between the spectrum.

My extra special thank yous to the women and men who work on a daily basis keeping the parc as pretty as it is every day, and to the city for this wonderful treasure."

I took the subway (yellow line) there from downtown and visited for about an hour. There were some pretty walking trails through the woods which were peaceful and lovely to explore and lots of green spaces to picnic or relax. I also enjoyed taking photos of the Biosphere. The island also had an outdoor swimming pool, beach and La Ronde Amusement Park.

There was some major construction going on during my visit, so some areas looked pretty messy, but I am sure it will look much better in the future."

It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, and see it from a comfortable distance. Being the site of the World Expo in 1967, you'll see remnants of that event as you walk around, including Alexander Calder's towering art installation called ""Trois disques"" and the Biospehere geodesic dome. The park is served by a metro station (yellow line), convenient for those reliant on public transportation to move around the city.

For our most recent trip, we skipped the top attractions and just did some light hiking. From the metro station, we headed toward the ""Trois disques"" and enjoyed the scenic views of downtown Montreal. From there, we followed a tree-covered walk path toward the southern tip of the island, and then made our way back to the metro station. 1.5 hours in total.

We were tempted to rent those Bixi bikes near the metro station and bike it to downtown, but the fierce winds deterred us. There aren't a lot of food places around here so be sure to bring some with you if you're planning to be here for a few hours."

By someone on facebook who was selling me tickets illegally and I didn't catch on until too late.  So that was a super bummer.

Then,  I found a legit person, referred to me, who sells tickets for a living... then I finally got the wristbands and all the required paperwork.

I'm glad that music festival organisers make it difficult to get these tickets otherwise everyone would be ripped off continuously and without reservation.

The problem left is getting the monies over to the actual artists that are performing instead of all the organizers and music labels getting Most if not almost ALL the money from record, song, festival, and streaming sales.  It is QUITE the racket... the music industry.   And I am very sad for the musicians, who are the ones who lose out.

Only went one day, Sunday and saw the Fontaines D.C. (who were AMAZING...and I believe they will become HUGE).  Then Monolink, DJ Kruz, Hozier (whom I do not like), Tame Impala (LOVE), Childish Gambino (some songs ...not all), Boy Pablo (what a beautiful voice!), and a few other random musical acts.

Felt like the festivals grounds was more of a fairgrounds than geared towards music festival goers.  Been a long long time since I've been to a community local fair, but with all the booze-pushing salespeople and all the pushers of whatever...it really felt like I was at the circus rather than a music festival.

I did, however, like the options for healthy food instead of just hotdogs all the time.  Poutine??  Ummmmm.... No.... I do not eat Poutine.  That is THE most fattening food on the planet earth... hands down... hahahaaaa...  I will allow others to enjoy it tho...just leave me out of that.

Festivals goers seemed pretty occupied with themselves and their phones.  Or themselves and their specific ""wolf pack"".  Pretty oblivious bunch of people.  Will run into you or over you and will not care.

Maybe if there was a real dress code...and that is to dress UP, not down... and people would care more about running into others.

Coachella does a better job of inspiring people to dress UP.  It's nice when people do.  Much prettier humans to look at and it improves the entire festival experience.

Dress UP Montreal."

There is an exceptional canopy there, one of the rarest and oldest in Quebec, in fact, the park has a collection of rare and also heritage trees, to be discovered in the Jardin des Floralies and on the island of Ste-Hélène. . Espace 67 is a project set up for event promoters who wanted to improve the offer of public shows in a strategic location in the park (especially large programs that can accommodate thousands of people). As a result, the place for sport and nature comes second in the priorities of the park. For about 15 years, the park's infrastructure has been falling apart, one thinks of the pavilions of Expo 67 established in a temporary perspective at the time which have not undergone any major renovation. We think of the Roseraie d'Hélène de Champlain along the Mcdonals road which has ruined tonelles which threatens to fall. The Korea Pavilion which is located near the bus stop, the Place des Nations (although mentioned in the 2021 Master Plan) as well as various locations clearly visible to visitors. The park has in its head a future more focused on the environment, mobility and awareness of biodiversity for the next decade. The catering offer is in the sights but it is always better to plan a lunch or a picnic before the trip. It's to do.

L'Espace 67 est un projet mise en place pour les promoteurs évenementiels qui souhaitaient bonifier l'offre des spectacles publiques dans un endroit stratégique sur le parc (notamment les grosses programmations pouvant accueillir des milliers de personnes). De ce fait, la place au sport et à la nature arrive en second dans les priorités du parc. Depuis environ 15 ans, les infrastructures du parc tombent en morceau, on pense aux pavillons de l'Expo 67 établit dans une optique temporaire à l'époque qui n'ont pas subit de rénovation majeure. On pense à la Roseraie d'Hélène de Champlain le long du chemin Mcdonals qui a des tonelles en ruines qui menace de tomber. Le Pavillon de la Corée qui se trouve près de l'arrêt de bus, la Place des Nations (bien que citée dans le Plan Directeur 2021) ainsi que divers emplacement bien présent à la vue des visiteurs. Le parc à dans la tête un avenir plus axée sur l'environnement, la mobilité et la prise de conscience envers la biodiversité pour la prochaine décennie.

Nos seuls bémoles: la sécurité est absent dans certains secteurs du parc et la signalisation est déficiente pour les automobilistes (ex: beaucoup de visiteurs cherchent l'entrée du Casino à partir du Circuit Gilles Villeneuve). Nous fréquentons régulièrement ce parc depuis 2013 et nous sommes pas encore tanné de le faire!

En bonis: Une station de Métro (ligne jaune) débarque directement à côté de la Biosphère. Parfait pour Piknik Électronik!

A magnificent urban park with a multitude of activities to offer! Whether you're watching a concert at the brand new ""Espace 67"" (version 2.0 was inaugurated in 2019), the outdoor pool, the numerous walking trails, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve racetrack, the Olympic rowing basin, the Biosphere, the casino's beach etc. Parc Jean Drapeau is perfect for those who love to play outdoors! Our only complaints: security is lacking in certain areas of the park and signage is missing / unclear for many drivers (ex: many drivers are often looking for the entrance to the Montreal casino from the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve racetrack). We're regulars to this park since 2013 and we're still not bored of it!

Bonus: there's a subway station (yellow line of the Métro) that stops right next to the Biosphere. It's perfect for Piknik Électronik!"

Congratulations, however, on the beautiful snow removal effort (November 2019), especially for easier access to the casino for pedestrians who like to go through the gardens. We must never forget that the casino remains the busiest place on the islands, except for special events.

The park is a great place to relax, a quarter of an hour from downtown, by subway.

Fort joli parc, quoique vous aurez à composer à l'occasion avec la pollution sonore, la priorité accordée à plusieurs endroits aux véhicules, motorisés ou non, et une circulation piétonne déficiente en raison de nombreux sentiers inaccessibles, clôturés en été.
