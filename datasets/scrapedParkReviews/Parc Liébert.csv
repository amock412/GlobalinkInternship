There is a splash pad during the summer, baseball court, and playground for kids ( toddlers and older ones). But if dog owners could stick to the dog park on site ( or at least freaking pick up their dogs poop ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„!!) it would be even better."

One of them is equipped with water so kids can splash aroundðŸ˜‚ there are 2 baseball playgrounds and some paths in between when you could go for a run. I personally not a fan of this park as the sun don t seem to go through and it s pretty much dark all day. But if you want to hide from the heat and the sun, this will be your perfect spotðŸ˜‚"
