It’s a hidden forgotten place. I heard it has been renovated that’s why it’s looking very pretty. The trail is long and a bit confusing so it’s better to bike it than to walk it. You won’t regret this magical place. It’s one of the best spot to paddle boat and catch the sunset!

Unfortunately, the beautiful boardwalk pictured no longer exists. It had begun to buckle years ago, as has another boardwalk in the park. As a result, access to some of the best areas of the park is no longer possible. The park is cut in two.

As someone who loved this park, it is a shame. The main boardwalk has not been replaced, and the large, expansive marsh it crossed is no longer accessible. We have been hoping it would have been replaced long ago."

If I wanted my car to be robbed, I would have parked it somewhere else for free... This parking lot is clearly the SPOT for this particular thief and seems to be doing it often, as this entrance is practically in the middle of nowhere and the closest bodyshop said that they have one case like this every week.

This park has forest in it's natural state with well maintained trails. There is a boardwalk over a large marsh where birdwatching can net a number of species. I like looking for the turtles too. Owl will nest in the forest. Walking in the summer is great. In the winter the trails are very popular with cross-country skiers. The northern section of the park has a chalet and a very small beach. The beach fronts a swimming area that is very shallow and perfect for very young children. A lifeguard is on station in the summer for daytime hours. We need more parks like this one in the Montreal area.

Reasons to go:
1. The Variety of Birds, Turtles and Wildlife
2. Nice Swamps, Nice Ponds

Yet the park can take you less than 2:30 hours to do almost all the routes, also parts of the park are close to the main road, and you can hear cars a lot. Also parts of the park are not well maintained, the bridges where down and dangerous when I went there.
