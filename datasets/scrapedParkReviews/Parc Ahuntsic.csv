These people have built a brand new park inside of the old one. The ild skatepark (old*) was still there but clearly back shadowed by this new Adult Themed Park.
Like, are we all supposed-to quit our day jobs and start having fun in the blimmin park?

A pond/fountain allows you to admire ducks and geese. A baseball diamond (Gary Carter stadium) is home to the Ahuntsic Orioles.

The skatepark has a few rails and ramps. The children's play area has the usual set up, slides, swings, a toddler's corner and such.
So be it for sitting on a bench, feeding a duck or doing a grind you will find it here.
