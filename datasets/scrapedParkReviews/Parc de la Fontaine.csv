SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy."

The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.

A truly excellent place to relax on a nice day.

The one point of contention is the amphitheater, which seems like a promising venue, but which is very run-down.  I've never seen or heard of any performances being staged in this venue, which strikes me as unfortunate, given its potential."
