The big cross that lights up is close to the highest point but the lookout view point that you might recognize from the Google picture is by the Mount royal chalet in the direction of ' Smith House ' .

Visited the park during spring 2021. The trails leading up to the great house and lookout has beautiful trees and lots of birds and some wildlife. It is definitely a closer walk to nature in the middle of the city. The walk from parking to the top is approximately 15 mins at regular pace with kids. At the top of the lookout you are able to see all of downtown Montreal, The historic bridges and the harbour. If you have binoculars I highly recommend bringing them.

Other:
There were bathrooms on site, I can't speak to cleanliness though. And there's a small cafe that sells coffee and a few small food items. But bring your own water though, prices are touristy."

The views of the city can't be beat and at the end Beaver Lake with it's Waltzes playing and skaters not to mention the hot chocolate. Simply the best way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

You can drive or just climb some stairs to get to the top. I was there in the mornng after a snowstorm and it is a fairly easy mountain to go. Though the snow was a bit thick which made it hard to find the trail, the path to the top isn't long at all (around 45 minutes for a first time visitor I guess).

A reminder is to wear boots for snowy days.   I didn't wear a snowboot cause I only brought one pair of shoes with me and my feet were soaked with snow.

Other than that there is no reason for not going there honestly. Easy to go and great view.

Pick a day with good weather and blue sky. Definitely worth it !"

You have to pass through the cemetery to get to the top, but it's one of those old, interesting cemeteries that invites you to read the headstones as you pass.

Once on top you can see nearly all of Montreal and the river. There's also an old art gallery with a gift shop and some paintings still there although most have been removed. For me it was a place to warm up after a cold walk.

Let's be honest. It's less of a mountain and more of a large hill, but the sights it provides is absolutely amazing.

Go during the weekday evenings so you can see the twinkling lights of downtown.

There are washrooms BEHIND the large building - you have to go down a few steps.

If you walk along the path, you can walk past the observation deck, and into a large open grass field - perfect for groups or couples who want peace and quiet."

Lots of people use this, skiing, mountain bike riding, joggers, walkers, sledding, such a great place.  Despite the snow, trails are well maintained.  Very safe to walk around... I went up here at 3am one morning (couldn't sleep jet lag), I did take a torch but didn't need it as the lights from McGill University and the hospital shone up this way, so was able to see the trail no problems.  Near the top there is some more lights (where communication tower is) and against the white snow I didn’t need my torch.  Not sure how it goes during summer.  I went up this hill many times during my stay,  ice skating rink, the stone art, the cross at top, plus the awesome view of the city, so many things in this area so close to the city.  Need to take care if you going up the stairs, very icy, very steep, I preferred to go via the wide trail that winds its way up the hill, as much as the stairs are a great heart burner and good for getting heart rate up, too slippery and had a close call, so the slow burn up the trail incline was for me.

There are plenty of hiking paths leading to scenic views of Montreal.   You can also drive and ride your bike throughout the park.  There is also a city transit bus that has pickup and drop-off spots throughout.    There is also a rest area with restrooms near the lake.  The lake is small but cute and is filled with gold fish.   There is plenty of picnic areas throughout the park as well.   The park is big but walkable.   There is a water fountain in the rest area but I'd recommend if hiking the park to bring water.   Plenty if fields for the dogs and kids to play .

The main chalet on top has some beautiful rooms, amenities and art pieces; the craftsmanship on it is great for a building that's as old as this. I had a great time just walking around it for a while. The bathrooms in there might be useful!

You can enjoy Beaver Lake, Maison Smith, the giant Cross on top of Mount Royal and of course the lookout right by Chalet Mont-Royal. The cemeteries nearby are also really beautiful and make for a nice afternoon or even as a day activity if you like nature and hiking!

To start with is a privilege to have a place like that in the middle of the city. There are plenty of grass to have a picnic at different points, and there is a big forest in which you will feel transported outside town within minutes.
You can see the east part of town from the Cafe suspendu. As you keep going up you can visit the cross, quite impressive, but no views from there.
From the chalet you can see the south part of the city, with the skyline. In the café you can have drinks and snacks, and there is also a souvenir shop with nice quality items.
My favourite place is the lac aux castors. As you can see in the photos, is beautiful. You can perfectly picnic there or just spend the afternoon with a nice book. There is a small Cascade that bring up the place.
If you need to disconnect but you can't leave town, this is the perfect place for you to reconnect with nature."

The view of the city is iconic. You don't have to be a pro to get to the top, there are many paths and staircases that her you to the top in as little as half and hour at a leisurely pace. You can also go longer and go up and down in two hours or so. It's my favourite place to escape the busy city life without having to drive out."

There is one family style restroom on the main floor and a drinking fountain located close by. I saw several people that brought picnic food to enjoy, which is a great idea!

1. Ferris wheel at the port of an old city
2. Observatory 360 in the city centre
3. Mont royal park
I can say that observatory give you the biggest angle of view (360), so you can see everything in any direction possible. You can see Olympic stadium, old port, almost everything. So it is worth visiting.
2. Mont royal park view point is mainly facing city centre, but you can also view some other parts of the city, so it is not as good as observatory, but it is definitely worth visiting
3. From ferris wheel you can't see much because of the skyscrapers, so it is not really worth it."

If you're here for the observation deck to enjoy panoramic views of downtown Montreal AND are arriving by car, definitely drive to this location. The observation deck is another 800 meters from here, and can only be reached by foot. Because this location sits at a higher elevation, the hike shouldn't be too daunting. My 55-year old aunt did just fine.

Of course, there are other ways to reach the observation deck, but all of them require some hiking. If you're downtown, you can start hiking at the foothills along Pine Ave or Cedar Ave. That hike is more uphill and might be daunting for some.

Wear comfortable walking shoes, bring water and provisions, and enjoy the view! There are visitor amenities at the observation deck, including restrooms, a gift shop, and a small cafe."

The mountain is something we can call the all allowed to do, except for a fire. You can bring your bet, cat, dog and others without a problem just to take care of their necessities. Also it is allowed to drink and smoke weed on Sundays close to the Statue, which is Park Ave. between Ave des Pins and Mont-Royal street.
Every Montrealer should feel lucky in having such an amazing park like Mount Royal.
