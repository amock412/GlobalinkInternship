To get there, take the metro to the De Castelnau station or the bus that runs along St Lawrence Blvd. It's a short ride from downtown. The park distinguishes itself by its sports facilities. A swimming pool, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, soccer fields and other open spaces will keep you busy. If you're just there to relax, there's a beautifully designed artificial pond that is surrounded with handsome trees."

It was formerly a baseball stadium, home to the Montreal Expos (today's Washington Nationals), from 1969 to 1976. The Expos were Major League Baseball's first Canadian franchise. It served as a temporary home (for eight seasons) until the domed Olympic Stadium was finished and made available to the Expos. The ballpark was typically called simply (and inaccurately, since the stadium was built within the larger park) ""Jarry Park"" or Parc Jarry. The stadium hosted two American football National Football League preseason games in 1969; August 25 (Detroit Lions vs Boston Patriots) and September 11
The stadium originally began as a baseball field in Montreal's north end (Villeray) in a public park known as Jarry Park. The only structure was the small unroofed grandstand behind the home plate and backstop area, with seating for approximately 3,000 people.
Beyond right field was a pre-existing swimming pool in the city park. Long before the ""splash hits"" at Oracle Park in San Francisco and PNC Park in Pittsburgh, there were occasional ""splash hits"" here. The first and most famous was a 495 ft (151 m) blast by Willie Stargell on July 23, 1969—leading locals to call the pool ""Willie's pool"" (French: la piscine de Willie). One of those was hit by Willie McCovey during a 6-4 win over the Expos on August 24, 1969. The idea of the swimming pool itself was later replicated in Chase Field in Phoenix.
The stadium was rather sparse, given that it was intended to be only a temporary home for a maximum of four years. The clubhouses were located along the left field line behind the stands. Due to its orientation, games in April and September frequently started with the setting sun shining right in the faces of first basemen. Eventually, it was decided to delay games until the sun finished setting. It was completely exposed to the elements, which was a particular problem at the beginning and end of the season, given Montreal's long winters. There was a huge gap between the left-field bleachers and the third-base grandstands, resulting in second basemen and shortstops getting buffeted by cold winds early and late in the season. The Expos frequently had to postpone early and late-season games because there was no protection for the fans. Even allowing for its temporary status, the field conditions were among the worst in the majors.
Although the center field distance was posted as 420 feet, it was actually 417 feet to straightaway center, and 420 feet to the deep left and right center field corners."

I was very young but she taught me everything about baseball lol. Then in 3rd grade, our teacher brought us to a  game. Then in High School I'd gather up with the guys cause I was now playing baseball with them and go often to see the Expos in the bleachers for $0.50 lol. I had my children around there still and brought them in the playground, we had 2 skating rinks 1 for hockey and 1 for free skating which I skated with my 2 sons and in the summer they played baseball and after we'd go swim in the small pool and growing up and go to the big pool. I have so many good memories. I even remember when my granddaddy brought me at the park, I was about 5 years old and taught me to fly a quite several times and go on the swings and pushed me, just as I did with my kids. My parents still live around there. It's been 58 years. And only good things happened. Specially to go and see several concerts. Genesis, Elton John, I think Supertramp and so many others. And of course Tennis became one of the biggest event. Just awesome living close by."
