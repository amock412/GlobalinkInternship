What a place to go it is so quiet and the water view is fantastic, you can also bring your children to play.
Bring OFF there are a lot of mosquitoes.
Enjoy!!"

Beautiful time to visit? Just before sunset! Just an absolutely clear view to gorgeous sunsets. I was there in October and there were still just glorious colors!"

There are a often few rough-looking teenagers hanging out here so doesn't feel very safe.

It has been inaccessible due to flooding as can be seen in photo and video taken from a hovercraft during Spring floods 2019.
