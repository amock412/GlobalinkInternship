It's a great space in that there's lots of room to walk around, places to sit down, port-a-potties are installed for events, there's fountains that add ambiance, and enough room for 2 large stages. This year, however, there was just one main stage, and a large tent for DJ music which also served as protection from the elements. My only complaint with this park is that it's not near any metro stop, although there are bus routes that pass by. Most times I just walked there from the village area, which takes 15-20 minutes, depending on your walking speed. The best feature of this park is its capacity to hold large crowds with controlled access, as the park is surrounded by fencing, with the main entry point being on Ontario St. I think there are other points of entry available for those working at the events."

Also it's well maintained but fighting the cigarette butts is a losing battle. Go to the park a block away if you have children who might innocently wander into danger."
