"Dizier
Archaeological traces in and around the Maison Nivard de Saint-Dizier in western Verdun demonstrate the presence of Aboriginal people in Verdun as early as 4,000 years ago.
Verdun had its origins in as an area known as C√¥te des Argoulets at the foot of the Lachine Rapids. It was initially a militarized area (argoulets meaning ""sharpshooters""), with concessions given to militiamen who agreed to guard the area against an Iroquois assault on the colony of Ville-Marie. In 1671, the Sulpician Order, lords of the Island of Montreal since 1663, granted the area (now the western part of Verdun) as a fief to Major Zacharie Dupuis, chief of the Montreal militia. He is believed to have named the area after his natal village of Saverdun in southwestern France. C√¥te des Argoulets was renamed C√¥te de Verdun shortly afterward.
He then donated his land to St. Marguerite Bourgeoys, founder of the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame, who in turn sold it to √âtienne Nivard de Saint-Dizier in 1769. The nuns' building, now called the Maison Nivard de Saint-Dizier, still exists.
Following the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701 between the French and the Iroquois, which reduced the military threat to settlers in the southwest of the island, farmers settled the area along Lower Lachine Road, now boulevard LaSalle. Around 1800, Chemin de la Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre (now rue de l'√âglise) was opened.The Canal de l'Aqueduc, now Verdun's northwestern boundary, was dug in 1854 to furnish Montreal with drinking water from the St. Lawrence.
In 1874, a group of local land-owners met in a farmhouse called Le Pavillon, located at the corner of Lower Lachine Road and Chemin de la Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre, and decided to found the village of Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre. Chartered by the government of Quebec, it became the municipality of Verdun the following year. Settlement had been hampered due to frequent flooding, but a dyke was built starting in 1896; its completion resulted in a population boom. The dyke itself became host to Verdun's popular Boardwalk, before land reclamation in the 70s led to the expansion of the waterfront park along the whole length of Verdun's riverbank.
The first √âglise Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs (now part of the school of the same name) was built in 1899, followed by a combined town hall, fire hall, and police station in 1908. The tramway also arrived in 1899, connecting Verdun to downtown. A larger √âglise Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs was built in 1914.
In 1881, the Montreal Hospital for the Insane was founded as a Protestant counterpart to the Catholic H√¥pital Saint-Jean-de-Dieu (now H√¥pital Louis-H.-Lafontaine) east of the city. It would be built on two farms, purchased in 1887 and 1907, in the western end of Verdun. Affiliated with McGill University in 1946, it was renamed the Douglas Hospital in 1965.[10] Today, not only is it one of Verdun's largest public institutions, but its campus is one of the borough's most important greenspaces.
Verdun became a town in 1907 and a city in 1912. Between 1911 and 1924 the population tripled and urbanization expanded rapidly ""westward"" (according to ""Montreal directions"" - actually due southward), and the farms were divided for residential use. The Moffat area west of rue Desmarchais was built in with ""plexes""‚Äîthe typical Montreal layered apartment‚Äîbetween 1920 and 1930,[11] and the Crawford Park area in the far west of the town was built starting in 1945, in a more suburban style unlike the orthogonal grid used in the rest of Verdun.[8] The Verdun Natatorium was built in 1930, the Verdun Hospital in 1932, and the Verdun Auditorium in 1938.
The city was chiefly (59% in 1931) English-speaking. According to historian Serge Durflinger, Verdun residents made a massive contribution to the Canadian war efforts in World War I and World War II, due to the many British immigrants living there who enthusiastically joined the Canadian armed forces.",1

There's a kiddie area with plenty of swings etc. and a water playground for hot summer days. In the winter, there's an outdoor hockey rink that the city sets up.There also is an enclosed dog area that is large and dogs can roam free and play with other doggies. There's a subsection to keep the smaller dogs away from the big ones.",1
"Very nice place, relaxing and nice. Good for walkers, joggers and cyclists.",1

children's play sets are old and outdated. this park is in dire need of redevelopment to match its grandeur.,1

"Park Jarry has a lot of advantages, I will name some:
1- its central location and closeness to the Metro makes it very accessible
2- BBQ allowed with facilities like special ash and burning charcoal bins
3- many possible a activities: soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming pool, trees for slackline, ping-pong, BMX, water jets and kids playground, Ice skating, hockey, cross-country skiing, ....
4- all ages friendly from birth age till 100 years passing through all the generations including families.
5- at a multicultural node where everyone comes to relax and enjoy the green and the nature.

Park Jarry is a great value to the surrounding neighborhoods and also for the people who come from far due to its accessibility.",1

What a great Oasis in the city. You can truly get away from it all in this park. The fountain is wonderful with all the ducks. This park has something for everyone. My only complaint are the homeless people but that is hard to control unless you want cops all around.,1

It is a very nice place.,1
üêëüê©,1
Good for children,1
Beautiful area,1
Perfect for running or going with children.,1
"The municipality is making a lot of effort to bring life to the Park, however, it remains a gathering place for people in situations of homelessness. It is not uncommon to see drug transactions there, despite the large presence of police vehicles. Same thing with people who urinate in public or who bicker. This is not the kind of park where you have a good time with your children!",0

"At the pool, no one takes care of enforcing social distancing. A group of teens keep jumping making it impossible to swim. I stayed 3 minutes In addition there is a recurring chlorine problem, one day there is not enough, another day too much and it takes them time when they manage to reopen. In addition, I was told that a janitor who put the chlorine had all put the granules in the same skimmer instead of distributing the quantity among the 4 or 6 skimmers, which resulted in the filter being blocked for a day. . The next day it was cleared and there was too much chlorine. So there's a good chance he missed the old one. I complained to the City and replied that he could not have missed it since he was measuring it by hours. The attendant in town didn't understand that if the guy didn't bother to go around there was a good chance he wouldn't measure it !! A sloth is a sloth! If the chlorine released suddenly, it was because it had not circulated normally the day before. We know that the right amount of chlorine is essential to kill the Covid. If I go back I will bring my kit and measure it",0
Nice park.,1
Very nice,1
Parc is good. People using it are not. The parc is disgustingly full of plastic on the ground and people who do their barbecues on the weekend leave trash and food ON THE FLOOR. No dog park although it is a necessity in this neighborhood.,0

There are toilets, fountains, games, a place with platforms for shows, a small lake with a bridge and weeping willows, a parking lot, a police station next door, etc ... In short, we Pass by and we do not think it's a nice place to take a break and enjoy the sunset in August. I keep an excellent memory and I will return for sure!",1

Not the best or biggest park I've ever been too but still decent.,1
Great place to take a walk on the water's edge. There is also a bicycle path that offers a magnificent view of the Des Prairies River. You have a good chance of seeing ducks. It is also possible to sit on benches or have a picnic on tables.  I recommend this place to everyone.,1

"Beautiful park in both summer and winter! Really beautiful ice rink (the blue-white-moving rink) which is VERY often cleaned! This rink is still big and the ice is really clean (no hole)!  For the other rink, it is handy when it is impossible to go on the other one but it is not cleaned enough in my opinion!  The only negative side is the schedule for the free skating on the blue-white-red rink! The schedule is not posted on the city's website so we may have to travel for nothing if we don't know about it !!",1
Gyu spot,1
Amazing peaceful park,1
It's amazing...,1

S√∫per ... despite the -4 C ¬∞,1
"I wake up this this beautiful park everyday, feels a lot larger than it is - the giant trees create a nice atmosphere at one end, with a large kids park for kiddos of all ages alongside (young toddlers to tweens), a rec center, small though used in various contexts next to the large grassed area, with a short enclosure all around for multiple soccer games or the like. A small designated dog park, gravel only, minimal room for any dogs to run around - still gets somewhat used as tons of dog owners in the area so is useful just could be largely improved for both dogs and owners.",1

Table a picnic.,1
Good,1
Not the best lighting 4 nite games,0
Beautiful park but right next to the refineries ... It could!,1
"A good park to go with some friends. On the weekend, there are a lot of people gather there, and it has a great sense of community. I don't advise taking a swim in the artificial lake since it's notoriously very dirty, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal! Other than that, feel free to eat your lunch there, or go biking. For a more impressive parc, visit the Mont Royal, or even the Parc Maisonneuve.",1

Place looks great.. Even has a water park for young kids,1
Nice park,1
Its a very nice and clean park. Lots to explore and amazing views of the city,1
Mount Royal has always something to offer even in the middle of brutal winter to the heart of hot summer. In my opinion cross country ski is the best of all activities you can do. Cheerful faces are real mood changer and beautiful vista points on top of the mountain are attracting all the time. This park is the immortal key characteristic of Montreal.,1
Amazing park for kids and the hike near by the Mount .,1

Very beautiful park with water games and play modules for children,1
Random city park. Not particularly well laid out. Too many paths edging out the greenspaces. Lacking something but I can't figure out what...,0
Nice park smack in the middle of the city.,1
"I think it is the largest central park in Montreal, perfect for walking or a relaxing day, the only problem is that it does not have toilets or at least I did not find them the day I visited it.",1
"Great place to bring kids to slide, it's free.",0
The newly landscaped soccer field is the delight of my 12 year old son who is a fan of the sport. Water games and play modules are also musts! I love this park because it allows people of all ages to meet and share good times. It is not uncommon to see adolescents or young adults integrate the younger ones and give them the basics of soccer or even basketball. Really neighborhood life at its best!,1
Stunning view,1

"This is my favorite park in Montreal. Way better than confederation park, which if you've seen any of my previous reviews, you will know I truly hate that park. But this park is way better. I came here once for a picnic with my lovely girlfriend; we sat at a bench and watched the ducks frolic in the ocean. I saw a child chase one and fall into the water. That is the reason for my 5 star review. I came here another time and drank 11 beers in the woods while I got bitten by mosquitos. I can't help but think those mosquitos got a little bit hammered that day.",1
Nice swimming pool with lifeguard. The place was clean and the children enjoyed it,1
Park of great beauty. Small flat a slight lack of maintenance undoubtedly due to the lack of personnel versus the number of hippies who come to make fires there without collecting their waste,1
Very nice place,1

Amazing place to go winter sliding. We used aluminium saucers and had quite an adventure! I coated them with a new non-caloric silicon-based kitchen lubricant my company has been working on.

"We go there ideally by car, otherwise it is long metro bus ... The river for me is mainly the attraction of the place and see the big boats slip in, we walk all along this walk , having a PC hat is in full sun, some sun loungers where you can linger and watch the river. You can bring your picnic, good luck to find parking in the streets around. There is a small ice cream parlor and at the beginning of the park. Opposite you have Boucherville Islands and can take ($) a ferry to get there. You can get down to some places and soak your feet, even some people bathe there, make sure you have shoes that go into the water so you do not cut your toes on the window of bottle of beer broken, symbol Quebec and finally a neighborhood where mainly we speak only French, if you want real change of scenery!",1

"This park is simply grandiose. The walking and cycling trails will keep you in the city but enclosed in a preserved nature. Several maps of the place are scattered throughout the site. Many sports are practicable, even golf.",1
I like to stop when I have the chance because it is a quiet place near the water and easy to reach by bike or on foot. There is a place to park your vehicle nearby but it is almost always busy. Bus stop 69 also drops you off in front. A few steps from the Sacr√©-Coeur hospital.,1
I liked! Perfect place for cool young families,1

The places where bikes can ride are designed wide enough for pedestrians and bikes to move around easily. Some trails are reserved for pedestrians and are magnificent. It is possible to observe different animals there. This makes for great family outings.",1

A beautiful park! I love going for a walk and picnic with my girlfriend.,1
"Nice green space, great for walking the dog.",1
"I went to this park to see free shows presented during the Pride week in Montreal. It's a great space in that there's lots of room to walk around, places to sit down, port-a-potties are installed for events, there's fountains that add ambiance, and enough room for 2 large stages. This year, however, there was just one main stage, and a large tent for DJ music which also served as protection from the elements. My only complaint with this park is that it's not near any metro stop, although there are bus routes that pass by. Most times I just walked there from the village area, which takes 15-20 minutes, depending on your walking speed. The best feature of this park is its capacity to hold large crowds with controlled access, as the park is surrounded by fencing, with the main entry point being on Ontario St. I think there are other points of entry available for those working at the events.",1
"Site of the Montreal Expo 67, now it is home to the F1 Google Villeneuve Circuit, La Ronde (Amusement Park), the casino and a lot of festivals, such as Osheaga,  Pinik Electronik, Montreal 77, Metal Montreal, Ile Soniq.

"Good park, but they have to do something about the basketball court and add some facilities for teenagers.

"No matter if it's Winter or Spring, this park is beautiful. Obviously, it is more appealing with a temperature that allows humans to be there at least one hour without problems, but nature has its beauty all the time. You can walk, take a sunbath or play p√©tanque! People from ""Universit√© de Montr√©al"" and the HEC, use to come at lunch time. Nice place!",1

Was relatively clean but nowhere to wash your hands after bathroom. Very crowded. Nicely organized food truck. Had vegetarian option :),1
So much fun,1

I certainly forget so much it's a treasure of urban open-air on the edge of the Plateau! Ah yes, just the pavilion with public toilets and community room in case of bad weather! For all tastes and all ages!",1
"Definitely worth the walk! This park is a cultural and historical monument and the view from the top is spectacular.  On the downside, it can be a bit busy during peak hours, but it‚Äôs nice to see so many people interested in walking outside up and down the hill",1
I give it 4 stars for the presence of the race track that I use 3 times a week. The game modules would need a little upgrade. We have never tried the paddling pool because the schedules never match our availability.,1

"Beautiful heated swimming pool. Masters swimmers are disrespectful and yell at people. Sometimes they don't even scream they whistle! We whistle animals, not humans. I understand that we have to follow the rules (extremely strict in this case), but I don't want anyone yelling at my children. All the swimming pools in Ville Saint Laurent are like this. Go to another city, you will see how the staff come to see you with politeness and diplomacy. And these rules !!! The Gestapo was nicer I think.",0

It took us about an hour to get to the top, but it's not so bad if you grab a bit to eat or drink in their Cafe before you head up. It's definitely worth it. The walk down took half as long.",1

"My kids grew up in this neighborhood and this is their favorite park. They have some renovation to the play area and soccer field, which only make it a much better place for the kids to play and enjoy themselves. In the summertime you can spend your whole day here, morning in the playground and the soccer field (remember to bring with your kids the sand toys and soccer balls),  then retreated to splash n sprinkle area where kids can cool themselves off (remember to bring the towels and water toys) and snooze off for a nap on the way home. Hooray for Loyola Park.",1

Central Park in Downtown Montreal.,1
This is a really great spot to spend a few minutes exploring and walking around. You are steps away from some of the best shopping and local restaurant destinations the City of Montreal has to offer. Can't we all use a few minutes of calm in the midst of hustle and bustle? Be sure to check out some of the Canadian history found within the monuments here. You'll have to look up from this Google Review though. Enjoy,1
Very nice park to visit.,1

"For a family with children 7 & 9 years old. The advantages: hot water, limited number of entries, trees at the bottom of the beach, soft sand in the water, well-guarded beach, parking near the beach, the police come to check that everything is fine. The -: noisy clientele (radio), the water is not very clean, smoking is allowed on the beach, the sand is not very clean (bandages, butts, bottle caps). The kids liked it, which was most important to us.",1

"The shortest distance between two Frisbees is rare air, which science has long struggled to explain. And yet it exists. Very green come summer, very white in winter, one can only wonder how many dreams have been hatched, how many romances those arching branches have witnessed. Cigarette butts play their role too, reminding the sun searching souls that nothing is prefect.",0
"Superb park perfect for all ages. The park contains several devices for families, such as highly developed play areas (modules, swings, water games) and sports fields. Perfect also with friends, alone or as a couple to enjoy the great outdoors, with its mountain and its water point that make this park unique. Mature trees, community gardens, and dog parks also contribute to its mundane character.",1
Beautiful little spot :),1
In renovation for a long time :(,0

"Square Saint-Louis is one of the prettiest public spaces in the city. It's a small and popular neighborhood park. The look and feel are reminiscent of European parks, but the houses around it are typical of Montreal. Many were built towards the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. They are very well maintained as is the park and the whole neighborhood. If there's a fairy tale setting in Montreal, this square is definitely it.",1
Very nice park,1
"Spacious pool with a large surface for tanning. The pool is split in two. A paddling pool or the smallest can cool off in peace and an adult party with a diving board, a tube slip. The safety is very good and the lifeguards are doing their job well. If the pool is free unfortunately the parking is paying. Count $ 10 for about 4 hours of parking",1

Next morning, took the M√©tro to McGill U Health Center for an appointment.  Overnight parking and 24 hour M√©tro ticket is an inexpensive way to park your camper, enjoy Montreal, take care of business, and avoid traffic.  Only rated the park 4 stars because there wasn't a good public bathroom close to the parking lot, just some porta-potties.  The lot was quiet overnight.",1

Beautiful and quiet,1
Super nice little bar / cafe for the summer :),1
"This smaller park is situated at the southern entrance of what is traditionally known in Montreal as Little Italy or Piccola Italia. After shopping around in the streets surrounding it, it's great to sit down under the shade of a tree.

Love cross country skiing here in the winter. Great scenic trails close to home!,1
"It's spacious and in the summer you can lie on the grass, although I don't know how that fits in with your morality. I guess you could lie in the winter too, nothing stopping you, it just seems more effective in the summer as being prone on the plants lowers your interlocutor's guard and makes them more receptive to your version of the 'truth'.",1

"Beautiful park where you can do a lot of different things - sports and exercise, picnics and BBQs, relaxing. The park is spacious and has a great view of the city and Mont Royal.

Facilities and amenities at the park include a tennis court, football field, baseball pitch, volleyball court, washrooms and a gazebo. It is easily accessible as the 80 and 129 busses stop right by the park. However, due to all these amazing features, it can get extremely crowded on warm summer days, especially during covid!",1

There's a significantly sized grased area and great trees with picnic tables and a great kids jungle gym - close enough to the water but far enough that it doesn't interfere with watching the decently wide variety of wildlife. Cranes, ducks, geese - all sorts of bird types - turtles, catfish :) Curious squirrels of course.",1

"I will not remove a star at a park under construction;) The lodge has just been renovated, missing some small things, but it brings a new breath to the park that needed to be renovated.  The park is not one, not three, but two ... Yes two new baseball fields! Courtesy of the former administration Coderre who swore by this sport;) one of the two is synthetic and is really beautiful!  A station Bixie is nearby (corner Dumesnils and B√©langer).  Tennis courts, basketball, ping-pong and an outdoor pool (under renovation). The renovation of the pool partly affects the cloakroom and the jet stream for younger.  The parking has just been enlarged. The playgrounds for children are practically new!  A fenced practice area for soccer is arranged (corner Ladauversiere and Dumesnils).  Residential area near a primary school.  The pavilion on weekdays is managed by a nice gentleman always very polite, who has at heart the service to the citizens!",1

"A beautiful urban park with a multitude of activities to offer, that you go there for the shows in the new ""Espace 67"" (version 2.0 inaugurated in 2019), the outdoor pool, the many trails, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, the Basin Olympic, Biosphere, Casino Beach etc. Parc Jean-Drapeau is perfect for those who like to play outside! Our only flaws: security is absent in some areas of the park and the signage is deficient for motorists (eg many visitors are looking for the entrance of the Casino from Circuit Gilles Villeneuve). We have visited this park regularly since 2013 and we are not tired of doing it!  Bonus: A Metro station (yellow line) arrives directly next to the Biosph√®re. Perfect for Electronik Piknik!  A magnificent urban park with a multitude of activities to offer! Whether you're watching a concert at the brand new ""Space 67"" (version 2.0 was inaugurated in 2019), the outdoor pool, the circuit, Gilles Villeneuve racetrack, the Olympic rowing basin, the Biosphere, the casino's beach etc. Parc Jean Drapeau is perfect for those who love to play outdoors! Our only complaints are the lack of a driver's license (eg many drivers are often looking for the Montreal Casino from the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve racetrack). We're regulars at this park since 2013 and we're still not bored of it!  Bonus: There's a subway station (yellow line of the Metro) that stops right next to the Biosphere. It's perfect for Piknik Electronik!",1

Wonderful winter!,1
"Too many children running around in tennis and skate park areas, they should be self contained to recreational park equipment and water park.

Potential to be an amazing park, buts lacks a lot of the necessary components.",0

The public pool is as classic as they come, although the diving boards are a little stiffer than average. We saw baby ducks, and a beautiful black bird none of us could formally identify. If you arrive at the park after dark, and hate mosquitoes, you should bring some type of web to keep them off of your legs. Can't wait to return, it is very neat and tidy!",1

It is a great place to hangout, to relax, to play many different sports with friends or simply sit down and enjoy a book or the scenery.  Ponds and waterfalls have been restore, fountains have multicolor LEDs, ducks can chase colored toe nails (just kidding).  It can sometimes be a bit like Woodstock since covid19 outbreak but hey, I don't know anyone complaining about that but the police.  LaFontaine Park is an oasis when heatwaves hit Montreal and everyone would miss it if disappeared.  That's it!  Now go.",1

"I lived on Chapleau Street for eight years. I could appreciate the arrival of the different seasons with the years, always moving. In summer, installed on my terrace of the first floor, I could enjoy the park as if it were my own garden. The dinners (suppers) taken outside were soft and fresh thanks to the imposing foliage of the trees that tickled the terraces of the houses. I remember one day in the early autumn when I took the air on one of his benches; a young man played the cello. The sound of his music spread like a charm on the park. I approached him and talked to each other when he stopped playing. He had just made me discover in this haven of peace the ""Suites for cello alone Bach"". We became friends. I also remember a great couscous we had, my friends and I, tasted on a huge Quebec flag some June 24th. A special mention for my landlady, recently missing, who welcomed me and considered her own child. I had only wonderful memories in this park.",1

"Serene with a nice pond and fountain in the middle of it. It's quite small compared to the rest of the parks in the city, but really pretty in summer nonetheless",1
Nice park!,1
The parc needs a bit more attention and love...,0
"Sad excuse for a memorial. Consists of faded rags attached to poles something like your neighbor the crazy cat lady would put out to scare away the crows. Some faded plastic flowers strewn at the base. Popular in summer for people watching while sitting on long granite slabs. The slabs are perpendicular to Ste-Catherine St. so you have to twist sideways to observe the action. When people are sitting here they have their backs to the memorial so it's a neglected backdrop to a hangout which needs to be rethought. Unused green space behind the memorial. Our lost friends and loved ones deserve better than this.
Piano in the summer months is popular. WiFi available from nearby Second Cup. City or local merchants group has not found it worthy to install a WiFi access point (the last time I was there).",0
"Simple but well maintained with benches and sun loungers. There is a bicycle rental, but it is, along the way, in Montreal everywhere",1

The park itself is very well landscaped and is beautiful in itself, that's why I put 3 stars.",0
Unique experience,1
"Very beautiful in fall. But at the start of summer, as there is no greenery yet, it is much like a forest full of leaf-less trees. And we can enjoy kayaking near the park. So, it's a beat place for a desperate day-off.",1
Great park with lots of facilities... lacks parking however,1
I saw pictures of the park from fall and it they looked breathtaking. Maybe its the time of the year that makes the difference. I took the metro to the place and the experience was ok. Its end of August and there was a light drizzle. The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.,0
"relaxing place, wharf, small beach but not supervised and not regulated fsillile or light boat (kayak, canoe boat but I do not recomend to navigate in this corner without knowing the St. Lawrence especially that it is the gateway to the port of Mlt so strong current and sea way of a depth of almost 33 m.Not at all a place for stunned and reckless, often in sos state ...",1

The houses that divide the park are sometimes very pretty, and bus access is easy, as is parking. you can walk there from the Outremont metro (about 10 minutes). Nice place for a picnic with lovers.

"Park that offers many activities. The play area for toddlers is safe and well maintained. And, fortunately, there are shady corners. 4 stars. An entrance on Lacharit√© street gives access to a dog exercise area. We search these places so that our companions relax there and meet their fellow creatures. This area is not very crowded. It's clean and well kept. However, the ground is covered with large gravel that prevents dogs from running at ease and can hurt the legs of young and old. Those who thought to put it on the ground have obviously never had a dog! 2 stars for this blunder.",0

It is a habitat for rabbit, squirrel, snake , duck, goose and even herons. Visitor to the area should be accompanied by adults. The place has its name because of the rapids. Depending on condition, the area could be flooded or this time I can even walk on the river bed.
Looking north is Saint Dorothee , west is Ile Bizards.

My favorite park in Outremont!,1
Very pretty park,1
"Great place to bring young children! When the chalet is open, there is a bathroom, water fountain and various toys that the park allows the children to use.
Only problem is that I once went when there were some obnoxious teens smoking in the park, but if you tell them to get lost the park is a nice place again!
Many seats for adults to sit and a baseball field right next to the park if your child would like to practice. Overall cute Parc Petit is a cute little park.",1

Park quite similar to the others of Montreal. But this one is calm and very well placed. It seems less popular than Laurier or La Fontaine,1
"I like the neighborhood, it's quiet. The park has many spaces for young and old.  Lately, like almost everywhere, you find garbage on the ground, for example blue masks.  Please note for our young children that they are not always careful not to touch objects that could cause them harm.",1

Place was okay but didn't like that the beach and eating area are seperate... Also the water isn't clean...,0

Simply beautiful.,1
"Wonderful day, we even saw the sheep!",1
"The Parc Fr√©d√©ric-Back, located within the Complexe environnemental St-Michel, is an ambitious environmental rehabilitation project. You can now visit and walk the complete path all around the old ""Carri√®re Miron"" some of the parts were closed for a while when in construction. On the east side weird little balls are set on ground. Very nice place to walk and very different. Surprisingly lots of Wildlife too. Not too  much people either. Parking can be found on the streets near by. Sometimes weird smells coming out from the mountains of compost.",1
Great place for walking my dog late at night.,1
Excellent place to run. The park's circumference is exactly 6.2 km. Very nice layout in terms of tables in the park that can be counted by a hundred (or almost). I just hope that the place will not be vandalized by young people from the disadvantaged neighborhoods around.,1
Beautiful park with lots of benches. Very calm.,1
"Beautiful park year round. Only the main trail is plowed during winter. There is a big lake with ducks, playground for little and bigger kids, lots of comfortable benches, bathrooms during summertime, you can bring a charcoal for a picnic, free parking, small wildlife... great park! The main trail is about 2+ km around the lake, but there is off-the path gravel trails also. Police surveillance 24 h a day, feels safe",1
My main reason to go there is to see the fireworks in summer.,1

Calm,0
Beautiful & relaxing place for a stroll or a picnic - practically in your back yard!,1

Cap St Jacques is a beautiful winter park! (I rarely go in the summer so can't rate that).

The park and beach are well kept. On this particular evening we went there for Yoga on the beach #YSP2019 and it was a crowd of about 200 people during this well organized event doing yoga on the -caused by the recent floods- immensely decimated beach.

Small beach,0
festive atmosphere in summer,1
Ok,1

I regularly visit this place to relax while walking in summer and winter. A little piece of paradise on the island of Montreal. Many deer families live here and we can meet them regularly. 2 sections exist a closer to st laurent which in my opinion is the most provided in tree and colored. That of the river side of the meadows is however larger. Plan parking at $ 7 for 2 hr by credit card or with change.,1
"A very beautiful park, suitable for families",1

Such a place to go for a break if you happen to meet by accident. A small park for lunch ...,1

Best place to unwind,1
Lots for kids to do here.,1
"Lovely park that runs the length of the canal. There is a bike path that runs the length of it.

If you happen to wonder past the park on the bike path; you'll find yourself on a peninsula across from the lackshore.

Wheelchair accessible as well as reserved parking spots.

Went ice skating on  sunny Saturday afternoon.  Lovely location on pond however  walk from change room to ice is treacherous.  Fell down on way out.  My companion fell on way off ice and broke her arm.  Staff  were indifferent.  On bright side  care at Notre Dame hospital was good,0
Really nice oasis!,1

"Nice green park, lots of room to run and play.  Parking available at the wonderful flood rescue center PCHS.  Water fountains, if you look.  Has a lot of Canadian Geese that hang around, and gulls, so keep an eye out, because they dont scoop up afterwards.  Many rigs in a fenced in area for little kids, too.  The big field was rebuilt and is astro, so no mud.  Nice views and great site for firework day.",1

"This park is a gem in the city!  Located on the old Mc Tavish reservoir, in the heart of the McGill University campus, it offers beautiful views of downtown Montreal, thanks to its height on a side of Mount Royal.  Sports facilities are available: soccer fields on one side, as well as chairs and deckchairs on the park side for strolling.",1
"This park is an absolute gem. I especially enjoyed the hike up to the summit, where I enjoyed a view of the city. There were plenty of people when I visited, but even so, this park felt ""wild"" at times--very different compared to a place like Central Park in New York City. It was hilarious to see the same cyclists several times as I ascended and descended the park; I guess it must be a great place to go biking! Overall, I loved this park and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a scenic stroll away from the city.",1
"It's a nice park. Good enough space for parking.

However, there were large crowds and I couldn't take the smoke. I don't even want to talk about temporary toilets that were installed near parking.",1

Nice place to rub,1
It is very fun and there many fun activities to do,1
There is a nice heated pool,0
Great trail development,1
Nice,1
"The park is beautiful with a ton of trails of various difficulties. You can meander up the mountain on the main trail, take the stairs, or take any of the paths through the dense woods. You forget you're in the city and it has great views from any path. There's a neat horse watering station thats near the top, its a good place to take a break for lunch!

Please. Please, clean up after yourself. Some folks leave trash and it ruins the experience for everyone.",1
Potential but very salty.,0
Beautiful park but because of renovations on the small house/plumbing there isn't any water in two of the parks man made small pools...,1

Nice place.,1
"Although a small park located on the edge of Ville-Emard, it can be a very lively and active park during the summer season, where you will find children running around in the sandbox, an old couple sitting on a bench, dog walkers playing fetch, adolescent playing a match of basketball and an occasional baseball match in the evening.
The park contains a basketball court, 2 half basketball court, a baseball field, a jungle gym with swings, a separate sandbox with a jungle gym and swings for infants, a small field and several benches.

The only drawback is the lack of public restroom, a dog park, and a weak water fountain system : (....",1

However, there are bike paths good enough and you can go south on L'anse des L'orme road to the route 40, have a rest at the strip mall, where there is a Trattoria with amazing cold cuts, sweets, buns, bread and great pizzas to be bought and there is much take out. There is a brand new bike path on L'anse des L'orme going east to Kirkland and St-Charles blvd, easy to follow the hydro poles.

"Spectacular view of Montreal from here.

You can drive or just climb some stairs to get to the top. I was there in the mornng after a snowstorm and it is a fairly easy mountain to go. Though the snow was a bit thick which made it hard to find the trail, the path to the top isn't long at all (around 45 minutes for a first time visitor I guess).

A reminder is to wear boots for snowy days.   I didn't wear a snowboot cause I only brought one pair of shoes with me and my feet were soaked with snow.

Other than that there is no reason for not going there honestly. Easy to go and great view.

Pick a day with good weather and blue sky. Definitely worth it !",1

Situated in the Plateau and a short walk from down town, this park is the perfect place to come to cool down beneath the trees on a hot summer's day or warm up while ice skating on a cold winter's evening. La Fontaine has something for everyone - ample space to picnic, beautiful views and luscious gardens to chill in, numerous sports courts (tennis, p√©tanque, volleyball..) and a caf√© by the lake.

I‚Äòm almost 62 years of age and I was born and raised in Toronto and thought I would Google Belmont Park that I went to back in Expo 1967 Montreal and up popped Belmont Park today. So I read that the amusement park has been closed since 1983 but it was a total flashback when I was thinking back to when I was nine years old with $.50 I could go on the rides all day long and go crazy! Great memories and that was the one and only time that I was ever in Montreal was for expo. But I‚Äôll never forget Belmont Park.,1

It took them 10 years to agree that there was room for the next hour. The payment and everything else was a very long process, we waited really long. The materials were disgusting; the storage boxes of the canoe were filled with water, their lifejackets were dirty, in addition the right footrest was defective, a big loss of money and time ... I do not advise you at all!",0

From what I can remember it was a wonderful place!,1
I saw pictures of the park from fall and it they looked breathtaking. Maybe its the time of the year that makes the difference. I took the metro to the place and the experience was ok. Its end of August and there was a light drizzle. The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.,0

I took the subway (yellow line) there from downtown and visited for about an hour. There were some pretty walking trails through the woods which were peaceful and lovely to explore and lots of green spaces to picnic or relax. I also enjoyed taking photos of the Biosphere. The island also had an outdoor swimming pool, beach and La Ronde Amusement Park.

There was some major construction going on during my visit, so some areas looked pretty messy, but I am sure it will look much better in the future.",1

Good place to explore downtown Montreal,1
A picnic full of love ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Almost $ 6 million in renovations thrown out the window. The old park was a thousand times better and let me explain. 1. There was a very nice fenced soccer field which was completely removed when we expected a nice synthetic pitch instead. 2. The children's play areas were fenced which made it easier to supervise the children as the neighborhood is crowded with daycares and families with young children. All the fences have been removed. 3. In all the places they dug, the sod was not reinstalled, they just put soil in its place. 4. There were a lot of benches around the play areas, there are only a few so that when there are a lot of people you have to stand. The skating rink is perhaps the only positive thing, we will see by the summer to judge. Big disappointment for the locals. In my opinion there should be an investigation to break down all the money spent on this project.",0

"Very beautiful place. During the Spring, Summer and Fall you can go there for a walk, meditate or just sit and relax; also, good place for a picnic. They have some gym equipments where you can stretch yourself. The playground for kids is a bit limited in terms of numbers of activities (I guess one slide and two sets of swing 4 and 4). During the winter, prepare your board because this park has one of the best toboggan ever, very open, high and long(you can slide for something like 50 meters) Worth visiting",1
"This well used place is very unusual, a wonderful gem, and friendly park.  Summer requires bug spray.  Lots of wide, well marked paths for walking and biking in the summer.  Lots of paths for cross-country ski and snowshoeing. Around my area, Sunnybrooke entrance, lots of free street parking.  Pay parking on the Douglas B. Floreani main entrance, just off Henri-Bourassa.  This is where the Chalet is, with bathrooms, information, water, and they sell snacks, hot-chocolate, coffee.  Lots of ferns, flowers, plants, birds, animals to see.  Creek and bridges to enjoy, and lookout points, and a few swamp areas, one is getting its wooden walkway rebuilt.  Near the chalet are picnic tables, water fountain, and porta-potty.  In winter the hill here is great for sledding.  Great place to get away from things and hear the forest.  Bigger than it seems, with a second chalet and another place to park.  Streaches to the River Prairies, where those ponds have nice birds and turtles too.",1

Beautiful park near a pok√©mon go gym!,1
"It is a beautiful and relaxing park with  a recently renovated dog park, a small water park and a playground for kids, which are now open. Sometimes atmosphere feels like Woodstock. Before the freak microbursting  windstorm of August 22nd, 2017, there were lots of old trees but they did do a nice job making the park beautiful again. Having a play in the park was a good idea, and has become a pleasant but distant memory of the old days. Considering many people in this neighborhood don't have backyards or balconies, going to a park is crucial for their well being, especially when so much has been stopped and may not restart as expected or promised. One thing missing in this park is an official skateboard area/rink so there is a lot of random skateboarding going on sometimes even on the cenotaph and obstructing the walking area around the cenotaph. Sometimes the distancing rules are not remembered and some boarders wiz by other park goers within inches so there is a potential for a future accident waiting to happen, IMO. You also have to keep an eye on the path when walking because, like most of Montreal there are a lot of  pot holes, skateboarders whizzing by and people who stand in the path talking to each other 6 feet apart  so you have to walk around them. Sometimes not much respect for social distancing and a small number of  frisbee throwers, not  wearing masks, tend to be inconsiderate of others sitting on benches, while apologizing every time they almost hit them with a possibly contaminated frisbee, sometimes crawling under the bench the person is sitting on to retrieve the possibly contaminated frisbee, so only safe option is to find another bench. Similar with taking a bus nearby. An unmasked person putting their hands on the back of your seat  gives you  no other safe option but to find another seat, cause someone saying that they are sorry while they are possibly spreading, instead of trying to prevent the spreading and the fear of spreading Covid-19 to possibly vulnerable people is not enough IMO & rather stupid if not hypocritical. We have gone through all this for 3 months, putting millions out of work & many businesses could go bankrupt, to prevent spread of Covid-19, so an umasked stranger can whimsically throw a possibly contaminated frisbee so another can  crawl under your bench to retrieve it. For a moment a beautiful park feels like a sad place to be.",1

The park also has a dog park, a public municipal pool and training areas for anyone who wants to run their jogging route. Funny thing to note about jogging, a complete tour of the park (periphery) is equivalent to about 1km. It can be a good way to summarily calculate the number of kilometers traveled if you do several laps ... üòâAlso peaceful for a walk.",1

"Nice square with a gazebo to make a stop, and perhaps enjoy the delicacies of Omnivore. It is not a park to play or hang out with, and it is exposed to the dirt and undesirable characters of the boulevard. Two facts: the big gray house facing the southeast corner of the park was Leonard Cohen's home in Montreal; and in the large Azores hardware store there are very good options for the house (and Portuguese clay cookingware)",1

"It‚Äôs amazing. It has a small skate park, a football field, a basketball field, a baseball field, a tennis terrain, an ice-skating rink and a pool (olympic + baby + water games). It also has two spots for children to play with slides and such and to even play with some musical instruments as well. It has a cute little bridge and some ‚Äúcultural‚Äù spots for Phoenicians. It is also like any other park: green with benches and picnic tables. Almost in the middle, there is a big empty space that one can be creative with. It doesn‚Äôt end there! There is a forest with several entrances! It‚Äôs like one moment you‚Äôre in the street, the other you‚Äôre lost in some interesting and mysterious place coming out of a movie. I explored most of it, but I didn‚Äôt go deep into the ‚Äúforest‚Äù because it was beginning to get dark. I am totally in love with this place. Almost forgot: there‚Äôs also a community garden (and maybe a museum, I am not really sure about the museum because I didn‚Äôt check it out).",1

Great view though. Then a 45 minute stop and go drive down . Extra challenge. I had three Russian speaking women in the car chatting non stop giving me a crazy headache and I had to act like all was cool.  Over an hour in traffic for a good view and a headache. Don't go Thanksgiving weekend.",0

The day we went there, past January 2020, it was snowing and had a blast there and if we go back to Montreal, we would gladly return to that park.

Its awesome,1
It's nice butbasontreals most famous park many improvements can be made. 1) Install many many more garbage and recycling cans 2) pave the main trail leading up and down 3) more lights for night 4) invest in more benches just about everywhere 5) Have more staff to clean up garbage,0

By car there is plenty of parking however it is paid parking which is strange that you need to pay when outside the city even on a weekend.

Wild-life bio students or zoology students would have a field trip if they visited this place, literally. I really was just hoping for funky growths in the waters and definitely found some.

Rather we need to be happy with what we have, and not postpone our happiness thinking we will get the time to focus on joy later. Pondering as we wait. Journey can take times dorchester square is the place to be when waiting. Highly recommended spot out of Canada.

If you focus on your kids and just look westward toward the handy CCI, you can almost forget about the surrounding construction.",1

"This park is a very great place to hang out with your friends and family. There are two volleyball court available to the public along with a water ""park"" with washroom accessible to anyone in the park. The water park is a great place to get cold water after a hot session of volleyball. Also, there are a couple of picnic table in place throughout the park. The park is right beside a river with great scenery into it.

The volleyball court is a beach style sport. The sand tends to get burning hot when the sun is up. Therefore, it would be wise to plan a volleyball session during the afternoon when the sun is less prominent.

Also, there are very few parking in the park's parking. Although street parking is very accessible. However, depending on the day you are going, it would be essential to check for parking signs.",1

"This is the poster child park that demonstrates how Montreal's civil servants can let a picturesque park nestled by the river turn into the most disgusting place on earth. A porta-potty overflowing with poop that smells bad 50 feet around. There was poop in the urinal, the floor and each side of the seat. I couldn't stay long enough to take a picture. Its located next to the BBQ area where it looks like trash is picked up once a year. Happy 375th bday Montreal... This is truly shameful as it is truly a beautiful location for a city park by the river...",0

"Beautiful site, simple and unifying, superb view of the river. Alcohol and food too expensive (small can of Bor√©al at $ 5). Really stupid waiter at the bar. You also have to pay for the rental of a ball, p√©tanque, ‚Ä¶",0

Beautiful trees, flowers (especially huge sunflowers in August), Picnic places, playgrounds, balls, volleyball, water jets.

"For everybody. Good for walking, pic nic, cicling, enjoying nature. Beautiful and huge.",1
This is the first time for me in this park the gift of the end of the day it was a parking ticket. The plates are all glued against each other and by dint of reading a lot of plates we are confused. I vote that this place is a trap for drivers so I inform you that I have very bad memories of this place.,0
Great place for cross country skiing and there is also an ice rink which is quite nice. It deserves an 8/10 just because there is a lot of traffic which ends up reducing the quality of the ice. I would put a 5 star if it weren't for the fact that there are no chemical toilets and the chalet is closed due to the pandemic.,1
Great spot for a walk.,1

"More or less for me. The mound for winter glisset is really nice, like the parties held in the spring but it stops there for my part. I find children's games uncomfortable and too much unorganized wasteland in general.",0
The landscape and the atmosphere,1
"Located in the Plateau area at a walking distance from Mont Royal and Sherbrooke stations, this park has two ponds separated by a bridge and small waterfalls. It also has a nice fountain in the middle of one of the ponds. This charming park is a fabulous place to go for a run, play frisbee, have a picnic, or a romantic date. Very pretty area to go and see, would definitely recommend taking some time out to see it and take in the beauty. Truly relaxing, very difficult to believe this kind of nature and serenity can exist in the middle of a busy city.",1

Beautiful park in Autumn,1
"Beautiful park in Montreal! Perfect neighborhood location for picnicking, playing p√©tanque, walking, etc. There are facilities for many activities: children's games, water games, tennis courts and beach volleyball courts. When the trees mature, this park will have a lot of character.  Small downside: the access to the park from the side of rue William-Tremblay is in stones and gives a somewhat sloppy finish to this space. Ditto for the steps and the amphitheater space which looks beautiful on the plan, but which is of no practical use and whose finish also leaves something to be desired.  The park is already very popular, and when the hundreds of new residents of the Angus Development Program move in, its use is likely to be saturated.",1
I love this place especially in the automne,1
belle place,1
"Nice big park, love nature....",1
Leonard Cohen is omnipresent in this park. His house bordered this park. Just that is inspiring. Corner of Montreal that breathes creativity. We want to contemplate and immerse ourselves in this microcosm.,1

"Honestly this park is a free for all. Thinking of coming here on a summer day, think again! Smelly bbq fires litter the green spaces, cooking with smelly foods and the smell of petroleum bbq lighter fluid poisons the air you breathe. Guys fish on the river shores, doubt that's legal.

A beautiful little park with very funny squirrels.,1
I like to go there for the peace,1
Well structured soccer playgrounds,1
"This park would be better if there weren't so many pedestrians and sketchy looking people constantly crossing through. The children's section is NOT enclosed, which means you've got to keep a very close watch on your kids. The park is adjacent to the Prefontaine metro so expect a constant stream of hasty (read: dreary) workers marching to and fro the metro station. It makes for quite the scene but not a good place for kids to play on their own. We'd much rather take our kids up the hill, past Sherbrooke, to the angus park behind the Canadian tire. Amazing place for the whole family!",0

"Located right next to Angrignon Metro makes getting here very easy ‚Äì there are multiple places to park (including a number of parking lots) ‚Äì we‚Äôve never had a problem with parking ‚Äì and access to the main paths from the parking lots (all of which have handicap spaces) makes it very easy to get into the park ‚Äì we usually enter via Boulevard de la Verendrye ‚Äì which brings you to the centre of the park very easily.

Because of the lake (big pond) and the enormous trees; this is one our favorite parks in the city to go for a walk in. This park is also incredibly large; in the winter we will frequently go snowshoeing here; its extremely peaceful in the winter.

It can get busy on the weekend in the summer, but the park is so large it can accommodate a lot of people.

Dog park, baseball field, running, biking. So much to do!",1

Regulations due to Covid-19 are posted. There is no toilet nearby. There are three lots with enough space behind the baseline and it is a very windy place. There are fabrics to protect from the wind but you can feel it selling. Very nice place for fun to play for fun.",1

"Jarry Park Stadium (French: Stade Parc Jarry) is a tennis stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was formerly a baseball stadium, home to the Montreal Expos (today's Washington Nationals), from 1969 to 1976. The Expos were Major League Baseball's first Canadian franchise. It served as a temporary home (for eight seasons) until the domed Olympic Stadium was finished and made available to the Expos. The ballpark was typically called simply (and inaccurately, since the stadium was built within the larger park) ""Jarry Park"" or Parc Jarry. The stadium hosted two American football National Football League preseason games in 1969; August 25 (Detroit Lions vs Boston Patriots) and September 11
The stadium originally began as a baseball field in Montreal's north end (Villeray) in a public park known as Jarry Park. The only structure was the small unroofed grandstand behind the home plate and backstop area, with seating for approximately 3,000 people.
Beyond right field was a pre-existing swimming pool in the city park. Long before the ""splash hits"" at Oracle Park in San Francisco and PNC Park in Pittsburgh, there were occasional ""splash hits"" here. The first and most famous was a 495 ft (151 m) blast by Willie Stargell on July 23, 1969‚Äîleading locals to call the pool ""Willie's pool"" (French: la piscine de Willie). One of those was hit by Willie McCovey during a 6-4 win over the Expos on August 24, 1969. The idea of the swimming pool itself was later replicated in Chase Field in Phoenix.
The stadium was rather sparse, given that it was intended to be only a temporary home for a maximum of four years. The clubhouses were located along the left field line behind the stands. Due to its orientation, games in April and September frequently started with the setting sun shining right in the faces of first basemen. Eventually, it was decided to delay games until the sun finished setting. It was completely exposed to the elements, which was a particular problem at the beginning and end of the season, given Montreal's long winters. There was a huge gap between the left-field bleachers and the third-base grandstands, resulting in second basemen and shortstops getting buffeted by cold winds early and late in the season. The Expos frequently had to postpone early and late-season games because there was no protection for the fans. Even allowing for its temporary status, the field conditions were among the worst in the majors.
Although the center field distance was posted as 420 feet, it was actually 417 feet to straightaway center, and 420 feet to the deep left and right center field corners.",1
A beautiful place to discover!,1
"Here it is rather the entrance to the buses (139 Pie-IX and some from Laval) which is illustrated. Right in the middle of Boulevard Pie-IX, along the Parc Pilon, it is really impressive to get on or off the bus with the cars on each side traveling north and south. This whole area is simply unrecognizable from my memories of adolescence, in the 80s, when this crossroads could not (or more) provide for the congestion of two hours of daily rush.",1

Beautiful park !!!,1
Nice place for walking,1
"This is a very big park with 2 basketball courts and 1  baseball field. It also has a ping pong table, a very big splash pad surrounded by large rocks where parents can sit and watch their kids. There are 2 playgrounds separated by what used to be a wading pool (weeds have overgrown it and nothing has replaced it) and they are closed off by a fence on the side facing the street, with only 2 openings I believe. Because of the way the park was designed, you have very good visibility for watching your kids. The playground for babies and toddlers is very large with 6 swings and two sets of slide modules So even if there are a lot of people, it doesn't feel crowded. The only downside is that there are maybe 10 or less picnic tables. Otherwise, there's a lot of shading due to the many large trees and it is very clean. At the moment, the washrooms are not available due to renovations but there are 2 portapotties available. They city did a fantastic job revamping this park.",1
Friendly park .... !!,1

"Great idea to make a park in this place! Unfortunately, for hiking, only the areas near buildings and urban roads are accessible ... and you still have to know where to go! When one wishes to escape, all the paths lead to fences ... It will be necessary to wait for the other phases of the works before having a more interesting access ... and it is not very clear when this will be done !",1
Taking away the cycling on iles Notre Dame really drops the stars for me. No reason to close the pool as well. They could have done the construction around the summer period.,0

"Super pretty park. If you visit Montreal this is must see place. It offers spectular views of the city along parts of the trail and of course when you reach the top. Its worth taking the view in and admiring the city and visualizing what it must have looked like when it was first discovered. If you're an avid runner looking for a new place to conquer, this is the place for you. Plenty of trails, plenty of stairs, and plenty of rolling hills to add any degree of difficultly to your run.",1

"An enchanting place for all.  I took a most enjoyable stroll admiring the lush green throughout the park.  The ducks, fish and turtles swam contently in their pond adding to the charm of this most scenic park.
Impeccably clean and suitable for all tastes.  The numerous athletic fields, indoor ice-rink, and jogging and cycling paths welcome the sporty type.  As for us romantics, a blanket under the rich foliage of one of the many trees is more than enough to reward any nature-lover.",1

Very nice park for a walk,1
A nice spot to get out of the city's rush.,1
"JA Richard Park is one of several parks in Verdun that border the St Lawrence river. You have 2 parallel trails to choose from. The one that is closest to the river - you can get your feet wet if that's what you're looking for - is preferred by those who want to stay away from the much larger crowd that uses the main trail. The main trail is wider and easier of access, especially for people who are here to bike.",1

Looks lovely, after the decontamination,  done at the expense of tax payers...     This park is perfect because nobody uses it...   it is brand new, and i can say was transformed from a dirt pile into a park.
this park was planted after they cleaned up a toxic waste site left  by the builders.  see CHARBANNEAU COMMISION
the residents want their DOG PARK back.
I can say as a resident of 15 years from this local area, Pominville is a very nice enclave of about 100 town homes,  built i believe in 2011

*past notable events.   THE MOVIE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2 WAS FILMED AT THIS LOCATION BEFORE THE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT HERE

THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS A TOXIC WASTE SITE SINCE THE GLASS FACTORY BURNT TO THE GROUND IN THE LATE 70s

I CAN SEE THIS ENTIRE LOCATION FROM MY 2nd STORY WINDOW

JEAN CLAUSE VAN DAMES WAS HERE",1

"Sublime place to spend free time. Several activities are organized during the summer for entertainment, show, dance, river trip municipal activities and so on. It‚Äôs a perfect park for cycling.  For winter activities, there is always La Route de Champlain which is open for sleigh activities. Unfortunately for people who want to skate this is not a good option because the original ice rink has not been available for a few years. There was a small ice course with thematic music playing and a heated mini chalet, but for two years it has not existed. By cons make a walk to cross country skiing this the best places in Montreal-North, without forgetting the magnificent winter landscape.",1

"A lot of jonkies are smoking tobacco and marijuana or drinking alcohol everywhere and everyday. It's an open loud outdoor spring break bar atmosphere (day and night) It looks like Plateau mayor Luc Ferrandez¬†doesn't care about it. Why?
Because the mayor (best known as The King Without Crown or Little Napoleon) may has a power trip reload or anger manegment issues. He doesn't have a ecological planification (√©coquartier) or a urban security program strategy (Tandem) :
1
""Key city-council ally Luc Ferrandez called the attempted explanation ""amateurish."" That, along with subsequent apologies, turned a two-day story about a tax hike into a saga.""
2
""... the mayor Ferrandez posted comments in French on his Facebook page that target not only politicians, but the general public, including flood victims for current environmental problems.

The post, which has since been taken down, started with the words: ‚Äúf*** you, all of us.‚Äù",0

"Most people stay on the main road of the Ruisseau de Montigny Nature Park. If you decide to do the same, you will most likely be disappointed by your visit. If you are slightly adventurous, preferably accompanied, you will get off the main path and start exploring the woods. This is where you will discover the real beauty of this park.

A word of advice, wear light long pants and long sleeves and spray a generous amount of bug spray on exposed skin.",1

You see frogs and toads,1
Awesome activities during the summer,1
"We went here to play some Disk Golf, there is an open disk golf course of 12 holes that anyone can play. The only issue is that many holes are near the borders of the park and a missed shot can send it over a fence. Other than the disk golf this park is quite impressive with baseball, track, slides, ice rink and some really nice hills which must be great in the winter.",1
Parking arena too small,0

A quiet and pleasant park was found alone or enyre friends,1
Nice,1
The paddling pool is closed all the time: chlorine level too high. The rescuers are therefore paid to do nothing ... by our taxes.,0
"Beautiful family park. Several spaces for outdoor training. Children's games are good. There are outdoor water games, the kids liked it. Several areas to sit and a cabin with toilets nearby. There are two outdoor concrete ping-pong tables available to all.  The only complaint is that there is no mature tree, it is a relatively new park and therefore, it is drastically lacking shaded areas. There is not a bench in the shade. If you want a space in the shade, you have to sit on the ground under one of the anemic trees.  We had the full apm and the kids asked us to go back. Do not forget your bathing suits!",1
"If you are in Montr√©al, Mount Royal Park is a must. If you like long walks with the girl of your dream or looking for a place to do your morning run. This is the place. And if you can, go to the chalet there's the best view. And i personally thing it is even better at night.",1

Park,0
"Beautiful park, seems to be very much used by families for BBQs. However, this park remains relatively clean and in good condition. Its cycle paths are great and very practical. There is even a playpen, safe and solid. The only downside I will see is the dangerousness near the river. Some trails are very high for the water and if you fall .... So just don't let the kids run around near the water. Finally, the flora and fauna is correct, not spectacular but with all the people who live in this park it was inevitable.",1
Beautiful 5km path I run every weekend . But there is a weird plastic smell coming from the industrial .,1
Great place to do jogging!,0

Jaime close to my home,1
No place better than here to see the beauty of Montreal.,1
Was Awesome,1
Super beautiful park to walk on the edge of the water,1
"Worst experience that endangers the safety of our little babies: the environment must be closed at all times and this is the sole responsibility of the park, which must specify this to families who do not know the culture of mutual and collective responsibility. It's a mess this place under the eyes of parents and grandparents who are not very keen. No respect And more control of the city is required. Jele not recommend",0
Awesome place for families and friends to come hang out with an exceptional walk through the forest,1
The best water games in town!,1
"Really nice little parc, nothing huge, but the place is nice and pretty calm. There is a part for kids that is pretty big, and you can tie your hammock on designated spaces so you can take a nap",1
Sports Senter Arena he bizzare,1

One of the greatest park in Montreal!,1
Nice place to relax,1
Perfect for young and old,1
"It was a perfect fall day and not crazy busy like in the summertime. Nice park. It's well kept and clean. There is a nice forest, but also has open spaces as well. There is also a decent size pond/lake with a path all the way around. Part of the path was made a path while some are unofficial paths. If you have children with you, you will probably want to stay on the official paths, because some of the paths near the lake are narrow and a child could easily fall into the water. The gardeners who work here are hard working and do a very good job maintaining this place. It's a nice break from the city, while being close by. Angrignon Metro Station is on the edge of the park, so it's easy to get to if you don't have a car. It has a parking lot and also street parking nearby. It's always enjoyable walking here. You are allowed to bring dogs to this park as long as they are on a leash and they are picked up after.",1
OK but small,0
Great place for relaxing family time,1
"Great open space. Perfect for running, relaxing or simply take a walk. Excellent spot to bring a date.",1

Superb place,1
"Very big, well maintained, variety of activities.  Totally a very nice park",1
The city has tried and for the most part succeeded in making this part of the city beautiful... However old habits die hard and some drug trading and taking can be expected to be seen here. Heavy police presence makes it safe to visit for sure..buti wouldn't bring small children around here.,0
"Super park of summer days with water games for children & families. For evenings and days, walkers wishing to relax can sit quietly and rest in the rays of the moon or the sun. I like the benches that are at the bottom right of the park for friendly discussions, ""brainstorms"" and all forms of interpersonal connections allowed by the municipality on these very pleasant places!",1
Very good,1
"Lovely place, clean and very safe. Nice day out with the family and free as well",1

On our two day trip to Montreal from Toronto, my wife, son, and I lived at a friend's house on this street.

The park provides pollution free area to the people of the neighbourhood who like to walk, jog, run, or cycle on well maintained paved walkways in natural environment.",1
House on the river,0
I took my students there and we all had lots if fun in both sides of the park,1

Loke the place.  a lot of people playing.  it is a fun place to be,1
I live this park,1
Nice walk and nice weather. People respect distanciation.,1
I wish people would be more careful with the cyclists as some areas are shared for walking and cycling. Would also be nicer if some cyclists didn't believe they were on race tracks.,0
Beautiful,1

Tr√®s jolie parc tr√®s propre merci la ville de Longueuil,1
"The park itself is gorgeous with lovely trails to follow and great cool air to breathe instead of the sweltering fumes of the city. Some fascinating ruins to see of old England style walls that used to separate fields. Clearly a portion of the park used to be farmland a long time ago. Lots of poison ivy so be careful and watch your step, but if you stay on the trail you should be fine. The beach is a bit of a disappointment, a tiny kiddy pool basically and all the BBQ pots have been removed, but it's still gorgeous if you go on a calm day without people crowding it.",1
Great ambiance live concert !,1

The park is very beautiful but the place where the children play in the water is not well maintained my little girl has fallen several times it is very slippery. And children can have really big sores.,0

Park of the strong men. A small spot to relax.,1
Very quiet place with a beautiful fountain. Great place to go for a quiet afternoon with a book!,1
Beautiful view of the river and the new illuminated bridge,1
Quite charming. A downside because the fountain at the geyser is stopped. The waterfall provides a soothing sound and ideal for relaxation. The weeping willow too. A nice bourgeois neighborhood park! Second downside: the high school courtyard with a little tiring amateur footballers. Lawns to redo. Well adjusted,1

Very pleasant,1
Not really beautiful because every time when I come to play tennis there are a lot of children playing on the tennis court so every day I say to stop and they don't stop so it's unpleasant.,0
"Before they made the changes it was a nice place. One of the rare parks where you could spend an afternoon feeling the cut from the street. Now that the fences are gone, a huge asphalt path disfigures the place, and a mound to stop balls from the land that is never used during the day has been added, the place has lost its charm.",0
super nice relax for my daughter can stretch her legs a bit,1
Good place for a little walk. Better for cycling when doing the Gouin Cycling path.,1

Osheaga!,1

"Just beware of skunks at night, and the occasional fox.",1

"There's a soccer field, tennis fields and a playground. However, for dog owners its a pain in the butt. There's a dog park that is not fenced and has restricted times. You can easily get a ticket there if your dog is not wearing the tag, you are using the dog park between 8 am and 8pm, or if your leash is too long. Also even though pets are allowed there, people is very rude about it and you can't relax in this park with your dog without having animal patrol frequently coming to check on you. Very annoying.

It‚Äôs a one parc on 2 islands system and the beauty of it is that one can escape the city and its noise, cars, humans, Covid, literally just by crossing the bridge.

A wonderful location to spend hours enjoying nature, birds singing,  color change of our rivers as a factor of skies reflection, trees, greens, and of course my favorite, macro photography.

The sight is even absolutely breathtaking in the fall when leaves colors go from green to red and everything in between the spectrum.

"In winter, you can go skating outdoors and sledding. However, it is a little high for small children to go sledding. In the summer, if you have a fun card, you can ride a duck boat. The downside is that there are not many trees on the playground, so it is perfect for a face ride in the summer.",1

Magnificent. Super module for young and old. With water games.,1
"Excellent meeting point next to UQAM. A space allowing everyone in the area to enjoy the sun and get together.

Very pleasant place in a nice neighbourhood.,1
"This park is almost pleasant when you come there during the week early in the morning when the daycares have not yet come to invade them. However, for parents of young children three and under, I would not recommend this park in the afternoon. The children who come there are large, numerous and unsupervised. There are those who started throwing sand in my daughter's face, insulting her and pushing her around without any parental intervention. So I yelled at him. Why do I have to do this? Is it because we're in the heart of the ghetto or what? WTF?",0

"Very modern facility. The parks and grounds are in very good shape and very accessible.

The kid park has great units slides and other equipment. And it's well fenced-in to keep children safe.

They have a modern soccer field that diffuse for football as well. it is one of the few that actually has a shelter for the players in case of rain or too much sun. It is also fenced off with adequate height all around.

a lot of the park is still in transition so there's some construction. But it is a wonderful park.",1

"To date, apart from the Casino, everything is under construction, young people in blue vests are there to explain and guide. Sorry but they suck. They're all either dyslexic or they don't care. In short, between punk or Metal concerts and unannounced works, it's a mess. Half a day lost for a tourist is very disappointing.",0

I just love it,1
Nice place.,1
Great place to walk in any season.,1
pretty one,1
Beautiful park for a hike,1
"Ok park on the island of Montreal. Everyone should go at least once. My issue with the park is this. People pay to get in yet it does not seem like they invest in anything. When you follow the trails you are mostly on lonely pathways that mostly do not border the water so you are.not getting nice views. Some places are paver, some are not. I was pushing a stroller and let me tell you this place is NOT stroller friendly, especially once you have to get through some wooded areas. You are constantly counting rocks and roots from trees. The park does have a few nice slots to picnik but it's not really worth it. The farm has a few animals but nothing spectacular. The park has potential but I think that day will never come.",0
"Very nice park! In summer, there is an outdoor pool, a beach volleyball and basketball court, and there is also a playground. In winter - a slide and a skating rink with a heated locker room.",1

Worth the walk to the Chalet!",1
"Great park, with a great view on the city on the litte hill. For winter days, you can glide on that hill it's really fun as it is quite high and just steep enough to get the thrill without the fear. Great for a family day out. And during summer there are 3 soccer fields where you can play, quite busy from 4 to 9 pm especially for soccer, and sometimes you can spend some time watching an official match which is a good thing too. If sports is not your thing you can always head to the bbq areas and do your thing there, just not the typical quiet place for bbq but for a city park it's nice. Overall a great place!!",1
"A nice large park, that is easily accessible by metro (station angrignon) and large enough to not hear many cars and other city sounds. A path surrounds a very pretty lake with lounge chairs scattered about. Be on the lookout for otters, fish, turtles, and herons! There are also picnic benches available scattered throughout.",1

When I say that it is cheap it is because I spent only 4.25 Can dollars and the entrance is free. You can get there on the yellow metro line, it is the last stop.",1
Wonderful place,1

"Great spot!  If you want to save a trip up north....St. Saveur has setup a ski school for kids at Newman Hill. They have all the ski, boots and helmet rentals on-site. They also have Tubing (which you can rent) and tobaganning (bring your own).
Great way to kill a few hours.",1
A very quiet place,1
"So I have been to three view point of the city.
1. Ferris wheel at the port of an old city
2. Observatory 360 in the city centre
3. Mont royal park
I can say that observatory give you the biggest angle of view (360), so you can see everything in any direction possible. You can see Olympic stadium, old port, almost everything. So it is worth visiting.
2. Mont royal park view point is mainly facing city centre, but you can also view some other parts of the city, so it is not as good as observatory, but it is definitely worth visiting
3. From ferris wheel you can't see much because of the skyscrapers, so it is not really worth it.",1

"Part of the linear park, this is a beautiful place to walk, snowshoe - when there's enough new fallen snow, cross country ski (classic) in tracked paths, build snow sculptures when the snow is right, and go sledding on the slopes that are created by the city workers.
Dress warm, covering for your face essential when it gets windy - the wind off tge water gets mightily cold - a windproof shell over a warm layer works best + hat + mitts.

I want to highlight the remarkable work done by your interview team. With the very changeable temperatures that we had this winter, I never had to turn back because of impractical trails. Well done and thank you.  In the morning I frequently meet Mr. Thomas during his work on the trails, he is super nice, inquires about us and gives us information on events that will take place, plus he gives Bentley a cookie. He is a priceless asset to your team.  Thanks for reading me and have a nice day. Doris de Champlain.",1

"I‚Äôve lived next to this park for 3 years and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favourite in Montreal.

SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy.",1

Awesome ambience,1
"Its a great place,  natural and safe to enjoy with your family and friends",1
Breathtakingly beautiful park you can visit all year long.,1
The setting is nice especially with the shared garden that is accessible to all. But on concert days the sound is too loud for the ears. Maybe it would be interesting to propose ear plugs ... beware of dating not always very clear ...,0
An wonderful experience,1
Fully deteriorates,0
I researched this place just to find the location of my friend who was near the one which is on the waterfront. But the part was very beautiful to see at the same time.,1
Great idea for using this space,1
Great place,1

During the summer there are some facilities with water for the children -and adults, of course- to play. Some concerts also happen there during the warm period of the year in Montreal. Great for families and anyone who is looking for a peaceful place to enjoy the beautiful Montreal.",1

The goto park in NDG,1
I admit that I have not been here but one of my favorite people in the world to grace this Earth played here over 49 years ago. Rusty Staub a great baseball player who should be in the MLB Hall of Fame but an even better human being. Rusty led a life reflective of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He fed the hungry homeless and lonely. He raised millions of dollars for the sick and injured.  He opened his doors of his restaurants to those who were shut out. This is a place I hope to attend!!! God bless Daniel Rusty Staub,1
The river is beautiful!,1

Beautiful in the asphalt jungle,1
Perfect little park to go to relax or enjoy a snack during the break hour!,1
"Beautiful park along the river and much longer than what is suggested on Google Maps. The presence of container terminals on each side of the park means that one will see many container ships passing along the river, which makes for a different vibe from the waterfront parks in the West Island or along the Lachine rapids. The ferry to Ile Charron is relatively cheap (under $9 round trip) and offers a pleasant 15-minute ride each way to one of the National Parks (S√âPAQ), a pleasant getaway from the city that offers many hiking, biking, water sports opportunities.",1
One of the most beautiful places in Montreal,1
"Sports park, even soccer.",0
"Children find it crazy fun. They are masters at home. The water jets in the summer are appreciated. The schoolyard gives them more reason to take the place of assault, abandoning their bicycles or their boards safely. The soccer field is popular",1

These people have built a brand new park inside of the old one. The ild skatepark (old*) was still there but clearly back shadowed by this new Adult Themed Park.
Like, are we all supposed-to quit our day jobs and start having fun in the blimmin park?
It seams like that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve decided to build for humane sakes. Theyre not bad people, they invested 49 million dollars in the 15 to 30 age group.",1

"Always in love with this square, so typical of the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood and of Montreal's French heritage.

Weekends off course are more crowded!
Parking lots are spacious...I always would recommend to buy a full year  membership...to avoid  the parking fees of 7.50 / 9.00 $ per 2 hours / day...
A really good cause , running a information center and bathrooms,  at normal times.
We really have to save  areas like this!",1

Outside there is a playground for toddlers and older children too. A hill for winter tobogganing.  A community garden is also available.......A great local park. In fact, I believe property values are probably higher around this park. A great place to raise your children.........",1
Nice park with ice rink in winter,1
Nice little park in a quiet neighborhood.,1
"The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa walk in this park seemed poetic. A stream and a fall, in Montreal? In fact, it is a neglected park. I guess it's a good thing to give way to nature, but it's not interesting to visit. Access to the creek near the falls is fenced. There has already been a concrete staircase once, but it is destroyed and the descent is a little dangerous. The ""fall"" itself is located at the bottom of where we see the sign indicating that Hydro-Qu√©bec participated in the project, we imagine in the distant past. It's all ready for the marker in Google Map. All along the trail, there are small steep paths to see the stream, but .. bof. The main path, in sand and rock is o.k. for jogging, but a bit ugly for bicycles. It is a curiosity but not worth the detour.",0
How all modern cities maintains nevertheless old houses and buildings ... very clean and tidy ... sure how is a characteristic of Canada .... cosmopolitan city and many cultures are regular visitors of this country in general ... .. many immigrants but all with a lot of respect for different cultures ... you can live together and this is an example .... nice metro and places to go ....,1

Overall experience: definitely something you and your family will love.",1

"Beautiful park, in addition we saw the small gang of sheep graze grass! The cottage is very clean!",1
Everything is house made.,1
"Incredible place! To start with is a privilege to have a place like that in the middle of the city. There are plenty of grass to have a picnic at different points, and there is a big forest in which you will feel transported outside town within minutes.
You can see the east part of town from the Cafe suspendu. As you keep going up you can visit the cross, quite impressive, but no views from there.
From the chalet you can see the south part of the city, with the skyline. In the caf√© you can have drinks and snacks, and there is also a souvenir shop with nice quality items.
My favourite place is the lac aux castors. As you can see in the photos, is beautiful. You can perfectly picnic there or just spend the afternoon with a nice book. There is a small Cascade that bring up the place.
If you need to disconnect but you can't leave town, this is the perfect place for you to reconnect with nature.",1

"Nice and peaceful time in the city woods. Excellent and pleasant, but short walk... Worth doing... With kids if applicable",1

Great clean park,1
I‚Äôm giving this a three because it got way too busy and the things always take forever to get to - if you want to wait 2 hours in line for an activity where the goal is to do something that takes 30 mins then go ahead. But I also gave this three because it was something fun to do with the right people.,0
Very nice play structure for both children and adults. It's hard to find beautiful parks like this these days.,1

"Park very clean, well maintained.",1
"The park is large with many beautiful places especially near the water.   However, I had to look for them and frame them in a photograph to really appreciate a magnificent view.  It is a perfect place to walk peacefully in a nice surrounding.  The trees are magnificent, and some flowers can be seen around including in the water. There are many benches and picnic tables, however, on a bright Sunday afternoon the picnic tables may all be taken and the available benches may be available only in the sun. I also saw the odd barbeque place.  For the kids there is a play ground and for young adults there is enough grassy area to kick a ball.  There is a bus stop bordering the park, and a metro station not too far away.  I saw very few ducks in the water.  It is a pleasant place to relax.",1

I never thought i would say this but tennis is actually kind of entertaining... would come here again next year... just dont think you can come here with your car and park on the street... cuz that would be a big mistake... do yourself a fovor take the metro... castelneault station... just down the street...,1

In the west side of the park, you can bring your scooter or skateboard to play.",1

Lack of swing for the little ones,0
"Nature walk or a bike ride, great place to spend the day",1
"This is where I go for my morning walk every day. You‚Äôll see plenty of geese with their young in the month of May and plenty of other wildlife.  My only complaint is that I feel the borough is cutting down numerous trees for what I see as no reason.  I could understand if a tree is dead so be it, but to cut down trees that appear healthy and strong and then just leave the stumps all over the place is despicable.  Also, who gets to keep all that firewood? Hmm ... Another complaint I have is the over zealous cutting down of plants deemed to be invasive such as phragmites and mullein. To some these plants may be an eyesore but to others they are a thing of beauty.  These plants beautify the shoreline but some people just can‚Äôt see that.",0

"Beautiful park but strange theme with sculptures of human animals (crow, owls, fox etc ... scary), stone circle style like the druids of yesteryear ... lots of symbols that make you think of horror films ... I find it all strange for a playpen. When we arrive we see a person standing on a log ... I thought it was someone who was meditating .. I found that he was standing strangely ... then I approach and ... oh boy .. . a bear's or wolf's head on a human body, then a crow's head on a human body The children were afraid and ... I too had a shiver hahah I don't know if we wanted to do reference to LaFontaine's fables but it looks more like the movie the wax museum like ... must be a nice place to go on a full moon night üòõ",1

"The mountain (Mount Royal Park), was absolutetly enchanting. The trails for walking were well groomed even after the snow fall and another parallel trail for cross country skiers was in mint condition. Children and dogs (on leashes) were plentiful which really made the walk come alive. If however, you want more tranquility a myriad of trails are there for the walking in the forest. The views of the city can't be beat and at the end Beaver Lake with it's Waltzes playing and skaters not to mention the hot chocolate. Simply the best way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

"There are parks and libraries, nice places",1
Nice and calm place.,1
You are going to spend almost two hours in long traffic lines trying to find a parking spot. Later you should have a nice walk within the park and around the lake smelling fresh air. The kids' playground is also nice but there is no nearby washroom so little kids will be disappointed!,0

With all the money invested over the years in this park, it would be good to improve the dog park ... redo the lawn with a few play modules. And especially to arrange a shaded area for the dogs.

I advise people to fill their gourds before going to baseball at this park cat facilities leave much to be desired.",0
Beautiful park for pictures of nature and hiking or walking!,1
"A very nice place to happen upon while out for a walk in the area. Parc Saint-Gabriel has a pleasant feel. Walking through it does not seem as if some artificially human made destination, created just to add some green space in an otherwise residential and some commercial area. There are pieces of art type-esque additions that were added but are not intrusive, rather, they're complementary. The trees are the calming charm - old enough to be developed. There is a path that diagonally goes through the park which is convenient if headed to the nearby commercial destinations however the green space would be an enjoyable place to have a picnic, sit and read or throw around a frisbee. It's not especially large but does not feel cramped. Street parking.",1
Nice park,1
Would love to have the chalet open on time every day as well as have the sand changed in the kids park. Been years since that happened. Otherwise a fun park for picnicking and playing with the family.,1

Decent park to hang out on a nice sunny day. Fills up quickly on weekends!,1
Gentrification efforts at √âmilie-Gamelin are going well. It's become a popular spot for hanging out on summer evening. Unfortunately that meant actively driving the homeless out despite the place's history as an unofficial camping spot as well as Sister √âmilie Gamelin's lifelong work in helping those in need.,1
Very lovely place,1

Love this park,1
"Beautiful location, ground for several sports activities. It is missing just a short squash court. This would be very useful when you do not have a teammate available to play tennis.",1
"If you ever visit Montreal, this is surely a must-see. Anytime of year. There are different things and best times of day to visit the Belvedere at the summit, for instance (although evening/night to see Montreal's skyline is probably my favorite), and also depending on how adventurous you feel, trying out winter activities is probably gonna be a blast (at the very least, to your inner child ü§™). There's also ice skate renting right beside the Beaver Lake, and cross-country skiing across different parts of the park.
In short, visiting this place being a must, having fun while doing it is a great idea, too!",1

"The park is very nice, and has some nice fauna and flora.
And even though it is a lovely place, it is only for a walk or a picnic, not much else to do.
And, unfortunately, it is not a safe place because anyone can fall into the rapids.",1
"I love this little park which is three times bigger than it looks because it is on either side of 48th Street and has a design that offers something for everyone. It can be said that basketball / soccer fields are very popular. Several picnic tables and benches are scattered and widely used, as evidenced by the many trash cans that still abound with vestiges of picnics and other activities. But I should have said that they are underused these garbage cans, because despite their strategic locations, there is unfortunately a lot of waste that does not go. Can someone explain to me why a person who is able to bring a full bottle of the beverage of his choice to the park does not have the ability to drop it into the trash can three feet away from her once empty? Yet I was under the impression that when she is full she weighs the most !!  Thanks, a bit of civility to keep our beautiful green space pleasant and free of unpleasant creatures (because your abandoned waste anywhere attracts rats and other vermin with which nobody wants to live together in this beautiful park)",1
A nice improvement. Except that the bike path is to go Up cascade phew .....,0

Large spaces, picnic tables, real toilets‚Ä¶ the only constraint is that the park closes at a certain time and the security teams ask us to leave the premises 30 minutes before. For us it was 11pm.",1

It's totally worth the 45 minutes that it took me to get to the summit, but I went on winter and apparently it was one of the coldest, so many paths were closed. In normal conditions it should be easier. I'm definitely coming back in summer.",1

Very beautiful. A big park with a lot of space.,1
"Very touristy of course, it's a very nice uphill park in the woods.

Food at cabin is pricey, I feel like they would make even more money if they lowered the prices.
It can get icy during winter, many people have slipped on the hills, dangerous!",1

It encompasses 2 city blocks and includes a number of tree lined walkways, a fountain, a fenced dog run, a beautiful swimming pool, a community garden, a playground for children, lots of green grass and fauna, benches, picinc tables and more.

It's fine,1
Nice little park in the neighborhood.,0
"This is possibly one of the most unsafest/dirtiest parks in Mtl as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't always like this many decades ago, but alas, now it's simply not the same anymore which is sad because the park itself has immense potential. You'll often encounter dog 'residue' or loitering all over the place) on your path if you care to take a stroll. Unfortunately, this park is not only gross, but dangerous. Despite the police station (pdq) 38 being across the street, it doesn't stop questionable crowds from discouraging people from going to squat for a picnic or a night walk. Don't let your children play or go there alone.",0
If it weren't for the noise from Route 132 it would be 5 stars. Access to the river and the presence of animals so close to the city provide a space for contact with nature.,1
Love this place.,1

"It's really a great parc with a lot of space, playgrounds and other terrains for activities.
Considering it is such a good parc though, it is extremely popular so expect a lot of people. It ain't a good play for intimacy :P!
Still, you can find a cozy spot where you won't be bothered by anyone and you can somewhat wonder away in your sleep or in a deep conversation with a lover or with friends.
A beautiful pond is in the middle decorated with a few fountains here and there.
During summer, there's usually a couple of activities/small festivals going on, so it's always worth a shot.",1

This, in my opinion, is only a fragment of my thought.",1

The pond in the park is great when paddle boats can be used (closed for now due to covid). The park has a rink (just renovated) and 2 baseball fields but I have not used them yet to give feedback. Most importantly 5 stars for the ppl who visit the park (most at least ;))",0

"With the works and inaccessible areas, the park loses its interest. For $ 9 a day, avoid parking at the tip of the quarries except to go to the beach. With the same ticket you have access to other parking. Starting from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rapids, you will find wood paths and under wood rather pleasant but without more interest.

"A rather unique place in the center of Montreal, with the most beautiful and imposing buildings in the city around the square: the old skyscraper Sun Life (1920s) reminiscent of old Manhattan and from which escapes a strange music to regular intervals, and of course the 1000 de la Gauchetiere tower, whose unique beveled shape from the top is a visual marker of the city. The hypercentre is quite devoid of clear spaces, this place is a real change of scenery and a good idea to stop during the visit.",1

"I quite like this Park, it is tucked away in Pierrefonds, and it was a bit of a journey to get there from East Montreal, but worth it. There is a small, quaint beach, and trails that are easy to follow and walk on around the beach and surrounding area. There was hardly anyone there, which makes it very attractive.
The building with a cafe was closed, but very cool to see such a beautiful old structure close to the beach.
It's a gem in the far reaches of Montreal west.",1

Poor customer service. We arrived 4 minutes late and there was no possibility of catching our departures ... ON A 9 HOLE (par 3).

"A beautiful urban park with a large number of picnic tables, benches and large and beautiful grassy shaded areas. A children's park, a public swimming pool and sports fields complete the leisure offer.  A great neighborhood life takes place and the park is never empty during sunny periods and during hot summer evenings.  You can consume alcoholic beverages on site. but the bylaw, reinforced by regular police patrols, requires that you have a meal with. This is one of the many reasons why local restaurants offer special ""take-away"" options.",1
"fantastic parc, go there on winter for amazing ice skate experience",1
Park in the center of Montreal very passing Many benches to rest in August animations were proposed at the time of the lunch break ... (gym class),1

"Beautiful, clean and busy with families",1
Very nice,1
"Well designed with fitness circuit. Well maintained ice rink. Longer chairs, pond, water parc with fountains for kids and hill for sledding. Basketball court needs some sort of fence though to prevent ball from bouncing away all the time. More garbage cans close to basketball court is needed as there is tons of trash from kids too cool to pick it up. Remove the no dogs signs, let people have dogs on leashes in this dog hating city. People pick up after them and I never see them on the lawn anyways. Dog parc at the end of the lake is terrible with large rocks and they put grass every year that gets torn up by digging holes and running which turns to mud when it rains. Common sense eludes these parc planners.",1
Good fishing spot ...,0
very nice place during a walk in the city,1
One of my childhood parks!,1

"Free public swimming pool. Convenient for cooling off in hot weather. The park has been improved recently and games for children have been added. There are now two ping-pong tables that we like. In the park, there is also an arena and tennis courts as well as a board park.",1
"This park is also full of big old trees spaced attractively, a dog park is fenced in and frequently visited where dog lovers and dogs can connect with old friends and new, a fine water park and picnic tables make for a lot of family fun in Summer. In Winter the ice skating is great fun for everyone, night and day.
The sloping ground from the main red brick chalet makes for a very pleasant vantage point to people- watch the pedestrians on Sherbrooke Street. So many come to the park with a blanket to sit and dream as the clouds pass over the tall trees. Squirrels love it too. As do dogs of various sizes as long as they are on a leash. Dogs can run free in the fenced in dog park.
Most importantly, the park is now home to The Vimy Ridge Monument as of 2017.
Where it is placed prominently at the mouth of the park facing Sherbrooke Street, it is called Place Vimy.

This park is where great memories are made.",1

Park was beautiful. Be cautious of people however. My 2 sons were approached by someone accusing them of bullying her nefew. My children aren't bullies. I was at the bench next to my boys when I asked the lady if their was an issue because adults should be speaking to adults and not approaching children in parks. She and her mutt sister decided to verbally attack me in front of my children. Classy!! Be careful!,1

"I love this park located near the Promenade Fleury. It is well maintained, there are several trees and benches. In the summer, I go there almost every day at different times. From what I have observed, the owners are kind, attentive and responsible. My little chihuahua-yorkshire feels good there, there are bags there if you've ever forgotten yours. Replace them out of respect.  The dog park is next to a school which has a soccer field, games for children and public toilets. Bus stop & free street parking",1

"One of the crappiest places I have been in Quebec. Those 5 star reviews are completely misleading. Getting into the park you risk being run over by either cars or bikes. No designated pedestrian walkway. Very rocky shore, view of the Montreal industrial area, dirty, uneven green area where you can twist ankles, old and run down facilities, infernal noise from the highway next to it. To be avoided! Clearly used by junkies after dark.",0

There are so many here that you almost trip over them, it's fun to see them run around in the trees and play and stuff.

Very nice park.  Very well laid out with an excellent skating rink that is winding through the park and makes for a very nice afternoon event.  There are buildings in which to rent skates and other Winter items to enjoy the park in whole.  Warm beverages are available to keep warm with a nice friendly atmosphere to socialize. If you like Winter sports this is a must visit place when in Montreal.,1
Quite crowded at the moment but easy to find a spot where u r at least 2-3 meters away from everyone,1
The place is ok. If you go to chill no problem but other than that don't expect the best. The great thing about the park is the view of the water!,0

We missed hotwine st this cold time of the year in such a place! Also it would be nice, specially for the older visitors, if there would be some more seating possibilities..like couches with loungetabled!",0
Superbly appointed,1
Clean quiet,1
"A rather small park with nice installations but unfortunately met the thrashing of litterers. Hygiene varies from seasons to seasons. It got renovated around 2005-2007 and a few years later met a new friend called Kompak Box, the lovely bouldering hexagonal caterpillar wall. It has seen better days.

Pros for people seeking bodyweight fitness training:
Pull up bars, Bouldering Walls, Beams(really stretching this one but I'm talking about the fences, haha. It works though but please don't do it if you don't look like a kid.).

Pros for people who just want to take a rest for their calves: Gazebo with a table and chairs, 3 benches overall, a lot of trees covering two of the benches. Accessible neighbourhood.

Comments for family gathering: The air quality is so-so so I do not recommend picnics there... since it is near a highly active commercial street. The St-Lawrence river is better suited for this as it has actual trash bins everywhere. This one doesn't and is littered enough. No one picks their trash because there isn't a place to throw it for 10 m of distance from their bench.

Pros for children under 6: Water Playground, Safety Swings, Sandbox, Slide.

Pros for children above the age of 6 to 12: Ropes Structures, bodyweight fitness stuffs... There is seriously not a lot of things to do for the grade schoolers if not walking their dogs... Though good for hide and seek since there's a lot of trees, and they are quite dense too! And the park isn't overwhelming big so it's actually feasible to organise a game of tag.

Cons: No swings nor slides tailored for tall kids or adults, playground is mostly tailored to children from 2-6, there is only one trash bin and it is located on the rear of the park thus there is quite a respectable amount of littering. Not enough cleaning as bouldering spot is often sticky and gluey (Please stop drinking cola on the Kompak Box). No sign seen for ""illegal to smoke"" within 9 metres of a children playground. No water fountain. (There used to be one years ago when I was still a kid but it broke and never got repaired and eventually they tossed it out) Too. Much. Littering. But that is because on the other side of the park there is no garbage box. There are 4 entries to the park but the garbage bin is only attached to one of them, haha. Not to mention it's at a junction and not even visible (and it's freaking hard to reach for kids).

Nearest public restrooms are at the CLSC(5 minutes of walk), or you can try the church which is also at equal distance.

TL;dr: You will like this park either you are under the age of 6, or if you bring your friends with you and you are under the age of 12, or you're just here for pull ups and bouldering!",0

The local hobo still go there for a beer. At night it's a bit romantic if you can ignore the stoner and the beer drinking hobo. It's very safe as most park in Montreal.
Lot of pigeons and squirrels. Its illegal to feed them but the elderly community of the neighborhood make sure there well feed!
Not great for kid. Gravel path.",1

The best getaway within the island...green open spaces and nice cozy walkways,1
"Realized situation, while walking on the trails, if your child asks you what this noise is, it will not be that of a bird or another animal, but probably that of highway 13. And in places, when you are more than 10 meters from each other on a path, this incessant noise will probably make you repeat your exchanges aloud. The passage under Highway 13 is very ugly. We wouldn't believe ourselves in kind. Disappointing",0

"We really like this park it is safe well fenced. There is a play module for children, one for adults (6-12 years old), there are swings for adults and children, a sandbox and a spring dinosaur. However the pit toilet would really need to be cleaned more often and it would be great to add a picnic table or two.",1
Skating,1

"I‚Äôve lived next to this park for 3 years and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favourite in Montreal.

SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy.",1
"Big and beautiful, very relaxing with good toilet facilities",1
A small street corner park. OK to wait for the bus in the summer but that's it.,0
Peaceful oasis in the city. Dog park with friendly people. Large frisbee field. Shady trees. Water play area for children.,1

Very nice play for cc skiing.,1
I usually go there as its the nearest park to my house. Only concerned that why can't we have a washroom in the park in case of emergency for kids. Otherwise it's good and 90% clean most of the time. One more issue is that few people regularly smoke inside the park and really don't know if they are actually allowed to do so or they just don't care about the kids. Thanks,1
üëç‚öΩÔ∏è,1

"A solid place to go to check out the small farm/see some animals (it was super hot and sunny so they were feeling a bit lazy, understandably). But the beach was nice as well, just make sure to go on a day that's less likely to be busy if you can, otherwise it will be super overcrowded and you'll barely be able to sit, let alone Wade into the water. Not much staff on site that I saw in any one place. Though they did have a lifeguard so that's always handy.",1

Besides Jean talon market plenty of restaurants to discover from pizza to mama Mia and coffee houses a large expresso. All you need is time and the right companion.

"I put two stars ... No, not one star. It is NOT a natural park. It is a park with kek gravel paths without more. There are also garbage cans but none, NONE (Did I say NONE?!?) REST AREAS!  First, You are coming, no parking! Usually nature parks have parking lots.  Second, no chalet. So no toilets, access to drinking water and nothing!  Third, everything is let go. There was a ""BICYCLE FORBIDDEN"" sign but visually inaccessible! Cyclists don't see it it's on!  Fourth, there is no access to water! There seems to be a lookout but ... How do you get there?!?  Usually a REAL natural park there are signs that guide us, a park warden, a chalet, parking ... It is neither more nor less than a beaten path delivered to citizens who visit it at their own risk!  And on the quiet side, there is the service road of the 25 and the cars pass and it is noisy.  I wanted to sit and draw while enjoying the view ... No way no bench or table at Picnic anywhere.  I am bitterly disappointed!",0
"It's small, but it allows to circulate in a space a little greener and with fewer people than on the street.",1

"It is a very small park near the Grande Biblioth√®que and the bus station from which large long-haul buses leave for major cities in Canada and the United States. Thousands of people pass by and they do not notice, unfortunately, the memorials that are the raison d'√™tre of this park: Monument to √âmilie Gamelin Designed and donated in 1999 by the sculptor Raoul Hunter, the monument to √âmilie Gamelin is made of bronze and is 1,9 meters high. Mother Gamelin is shown stretched right hand carrying a basket of food for the needy of his time. The sculpture is not mounted on a pedestal, but on a human level, among passersby. She celebrates the bicentennial of her birth (February 19, 1800-2000) [4] .Gratte-ciel, waterfalls / streets, streams ... a construction Commissioned by the City of Montreal in 1992, the installation created by Melvin Charney is made of stainless steel, concrete, black granite ""Atlantic black"" from the region of M√©gantic. At a height of 17 meters by 32 meters wide, the work consists of three towers supporting a series of inclined planes. From each of the towers flows a curtain of water that flows into a basin at the base of the towers. The overflow escapes along four gutters that are straddled by seven small bridges / passages delimited by granite walls. The course of these four streams ends in the four ponds leaning against the granite wall delimiting the mineral part of the square of its grassy area. The three cliffs / waterfalls evoke both the cliffs of Mount Royal and the skyscrapers of Montreal. Gutters and bridges reconstitute groundwater flowing from Mount Royal to the St. Lawrence River [5], [6]. As there is the jazz festival, I recently moved into this park and there was a circus facility and an outdoor cafe with music and a friendly atmosphere.",1
Nice place to relax with some ducks and pigeons around..there is a large pond with a small waterfall. There is some construction seen inside but there are many parts of the park where you can have your own time to have a quiet evening,1

"Well I expected better, there is a kind of artificial lake, except that it is filled with waste, ducks and gulls are happy to make their need everywhere (which is normal given that it's wild animals) but be careful not to step on it. In my opinion the park should be better maintained, and there should be modifications to the artificial lake (addition of aquatic plant, and why not addition of fish) to do this, however, the lake should be made a little deeper.",0

"This park is one of the places I recommend people visit when coming to Montreal. It isn't a tourist attraction by any means, but it's an excellent place to spend an evening meeting locals and experiencing the culture.

I don't know of a city where people use their parks more than the Montrealais. There are a few things that contribute to it. Culturally, we are very community-oriented. Hanging out with neighbors is natural and easy. Spending time outdoors on beautiful days makes the hard winters more bearable. Park areas are highly valued public spaces, and are better maintained than roads. Tiny apartments with alleys and the classic Plateau three-storey walk-up townhouse make for lots of people with no yards. So we collect at the park, often entire blocks or extended families having regular barbecue soirees or cinq-a-septs.

Reasonable city laws allow wine or beer, so long as you are decent enough to have a picnic table, a table cloth, and a meal to accompany your drinks (though many people just go for wine and hummus/baguette on overturned jackets under a tree- the point is, be civilized.) Free wifi means people come to work on their laptops on picnic tables under the shade of trees. Benches set in circles are a natural place for musicians to gather for jam sessions. Most often I see klezmer, strings quartets, or folky accordion here, occasionally a small drum circle and group of dancers off to the side. There is a generously-sized, fenced-in playground  for families with children only, and it improves the park experience for everyone. I often see numerous families there, potluck picnics spread across many tables with all children playing together til 11pm while the parents enjoy some adult conversation over prosecco.

Because the park is so well-loved by locals, it has little of the danger associated with city spaces at night. Occasionally highschoolers will hop over the fence to dive into the pool, but that's as much trouble as you'll see. It seems that because they city treats its citizens with such attentive humanity in these spaces, the people rise to a standard of civility in them. In the warmer months, wooden loungers and stands for hammocks are raised, and in the winter a skating rink is set up for hockey, as well as a meandering skating path through the trees.

There are amenities for bocce ball/ Petanque, badminton, table tennis,  outdoor exercise (ramps, chin-up bars, etc.), and horseshoe all along Brebeuf, near the midpoint. There is a soccer field, baseball diamond, off-leash dog park, and free public swimming pool. A central building offers washroom facilities, and there are several water fountains. There is a Metro grocery store right at Brebeuf and Laurier and a SAQ a couple doors down, so you can pick up your picnic supplies there- no need to trek them along on the metro with you.",1
Very close to the lake and a beautiful view.,1
Lovely place. Just wish the the fountain lived up to the parks name. Instead of being what looks like a bunch of sad hoses spraying aimlessly into the sky.,0
Very beautiful and well maintained. Congratulations! I did not see a toilet.,1

"If only the dog park had a section for small dogs like the one in Villeray that would be perfect ... but hey it looks like renovating the 3 dog parks in Rosemont for, they say, $ 400,000 (!) would have cost $ 100,000 more for a little fence and one more entrance ... I would like to be the contractor for his jobs there!  Sarcasm apart, dog parks should always have sections for small and medium dogs and one as it already is for large breeds. Especially at this price. I have lived with large and small dogs and it is not at all easy to ensure the safety of small dogs at all times when one weighs 10 kilos and the other 70 kilos ...",0

"This is another world, if you live in a city and arrived at this island which is just a few hundred feet from a main Street.
The island is hidden from street view until you arrived. Plenty of hardwood trees. You passed a gate crossing a bridge , then you are inside the forest. No more city in sight or city noise.
If you keep going straight, you will find a river at the north end. You can see the Laval at the other side.
You are now in a piece of natural forest by a river, all by yourself.
Think about anything you want to see in a country, Canada goose, duck and all kinds of birds, if you stay, they will come and visit you.
By the end of the island at the west side, there are even bicycle parking.
Park your bike and have a walk by the river bank if it fits you well.
I love it so much.",1

It is a very ordinary little park. Too bad the manager of the baseball field is so condescending and rude ...,0
"This is a huge park with many sitting areas and different activities for the entire family. we were looking for an area that we can access the water closer to the East end instead of always going to the West Island and this is the only place we found.

The view was not that great. and there are industrial ports on both sides so no matter where you are sitting and you look to the left or the right you'll always see something very huge mechanical and industrial.

There was only one main place to access the water.

other than the water situation the park itself deserves more than three stars but I am giving this rating based on my experience and my desire to get to the water.",0

"The entire southern half of the park is under construction and therefore inaccessible, which limits the interest of the visit and the time to devote to it. Despite all this remains pleasant to take the air and get out of the rhythm of the city. During the fall you will not meet many people, apart from a few foxes and squirrels.

Our guide from Dyad bikes made sure we were all were dressed appropriately, and he even took along some extra gloves, scarves, and hats just in case ours weren't sufficient.  Our whole group was fine the whole time.  David was an excellent guide, and the trip was one of the highlights of our trip.  If you're thinking it might be too cold or rough, don't be afraid.  Go for it!",1

There's a map in the Jean Mance Park which outlines the varying degrees of height and steepness of different parts of the mountain which is useful in choosing which route to take.

Best view in Montreal. About a 20 minute walk from the Loews hotel to the top but you will burn 5000 calories. You go up several flights of stairs.,1

Very well landscaped for children!,1
A wooded gem. This park has forest in it's natural state with well maintained trails. There is a boardwalk over a large marsh where birdwatching can net a number of species. I like looking for the turtles too. Owl will nest in the forest. Walking in the summer is great. In the winter the trails are very popular with cross-country skiers. The northern section of the park has a chalet and a very small beach. The beach fronts a swimming area that is very shallow and perfect for very young children. A lifeguard is on station in the summer for daytime hours. We need more parks like this one in the Montreal area.,1
Nice place and playground üôÇ,1
it's a shimmering park,0
Such a nice atmosphere for an event,1
Great green space for relaxation,1
Relaxing,1
Kids love it,1

They have a lake (ducks are cute with their babies ü¶Üü¶Ü). Also they have a restaurant there. A nice place to explore and enjoy.,1
"Massive and beautiful park. It's the home to many of montreal grand festivals. La ronde is just meters away, and montreal  beautiful Biosphere is at the heart of the park. Very clean, and well maintained. Easy access from downtown using the subway. The parking and traffic could become a nightmare during summer time, especially during MTL formula one or L'International des Feux Loto-Qu√©bec",1

"Superb park, very well laid out. Ideal for walking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing",1
"The lifeguards at this pool need training in respect . And so should the children who get dumped there by their oarebts.
The swim staff yell and blow their whistles at everything. The pool should have restrictions on how many people can be in the water at the same time and children under age of twelve should have parents with them. Too many kids are dumped there and the swim staff is put in a situation where they have to whistle and tell every 5 minutes. It is NOT a relaxed environment.
Of all the public pools this one is the worst. The staff in Dorval talk to the kids.
Here they yell at them.
All st-laurent pools should have  limits on occupancy. Children must have parental supervision.like the Library, these are public places, not free babysitting services.",0
"Beautiful park, clean and not very busy!",1
Nice 420 spot,1
Good for kids and games for seniors at night,0

THE METRO STOP TO GO TO THE OLD PORT OF MONTREAL,1
"One of Montreal's gems, Parc La Fontaine embodies the charm of the plateau, with musicians, people exercising, families, dog owners, and people from all walks of life mingling.  It's  a substantial park, for an urban green zone, with a big pond, and nice manicuring.

A truly excellent place to relax on a nice day.

The one point of contention is the amphitheater, which seems like a promising venue, but which is very run-down.  I've never seen or heard of any performances being staged in this venue, which strikes me as unfortunate, given its potential.",1
Lots of activities and shows! Peaceful place,1
Cool park with a nice flat area for some sports and activities... Floor is a little bit too slippery..,1

Beautiful park.,1
Very nice park.,1
"Snow, smile, season.. Super!",1
"Definitely worth the ""hike"".

Let's be honest. It's less of a mountain and more of a large hill, but the sights it provides is absolutely amazing.

Go during the weekday evenings so you can see the twinkling lights of downtown.

There are washrooms BEHIND the large building - you have to go down a few steps.

If you walk along the path, you can walk past the observation deck, and into a large open grass field - perfect for groups or couples who want peace and quiet.",1

Perfect for dating and playing basketball,1
My daughter loves water games!,1
Multiple bike connections.,1
Nice quiet little park.,1
"Excellent park with perfect water games for children, swing, banquet grounds, skate park and dog park. Convenience stores nearby and a Lafleur restaurant. If I only give 3 stars, it is because the space with the water games for children is really not cleaned enough and therefore becomes extremely slippery and therefore dangerous. Brown moss covers the ground in some places and many children (and adults) fall. It is really better to go there at the start of the season, June to mid July, then it's too dangerous and I don't want my child to open his head on the concrete.",0
Beautiful place,1
I like to take 2 minutes and watch the shows.,1

Overall good, just too many people during peak hours.",1

One of the most beautiful places in Montreal. I would definitely come back if I go to Montreal again. I really loved myself being part of the wonderful scenery.,1
"It's not quite the park it used to be. However it's still serviceable so to speak. The playground is decent, when not vandalized by the nearby high school. Which honestly, happens far less then you might expect, the soccer field is small, but features a modern social turf surface, and is generally accessible to the public. The pool in general is not overwhelmingly busy in the summer, which is a definite bonus.",0
Beautiful place for family and occasions like marriage but there is much work to do to update it,0
"This is a particularly great place. However it is not recommended to swim there. I have a friend who bathed there and he had problems. Fortunately, the beavers did not put it in pieces by the way.",1
We must have missed the crowd. It was a bit cool out but a lovely spot to rest and relax. It was very peaceful without the crowd that we heard is usually there. The service desk guy was very informative and friendly.,1

Beautiful church!,1
Good place,1
"A nice little park around the corner that my 5 year old kids considered to be a playpen (as far as games are concerned) so for the latter - the games - let's say there is better somewhere else for kids in this area. age but for adults there is a picnic table, a few benches, a few trees and surprisingly a kind of wooden bed ... (Being an itinerant I would make my bed of choice) ... that said on Fridays and Saturday evenings (nights), due to the club diagonally, the park is full of drunk and loud people. Park all the same well kept and pleasant at strategic times.",0

Very great place to enjoy the time,1
"This park is also full of big old trees spaced attractively, a dog park is fenced in and frequently visited where dog lovers and dogs can connect with old friends and new, a fine water park and picnic tables make for a lot of family fun in Summer. In Winter the ice skating is great fun for everyone, night and day.
The sloping ground from the main red brick chalet makes for a very pleasant vantage point to people- watch the pedestrians on Sherbrooke Street. So many come to the park with a blanket to sit and dream as the clouds pass over the tall trees. Squirrels love it too. As do dogs of various sizes as long as they are on a leash. Dogs can run free in the fenced in dog park.
Most importantly, the park is now home to The Vimy Ridge Monument as of 2017.
Where it is placed prominently at the mouth of the park facing Sherbrooke Street, it is called Place Vimy.

This park is where great memories are made.",1

There's Trekfit open fitness center on the other side of the trail path. There are also couple of stones at the riverside if you just want to relax and enjoy the view.
On a sunny day, it makes a great place to hangout. So many things going on here. But on a not-so-good weather day, it's very quiet as well. But definitely to be visited.",1

"Really good, I come to do push-ups on the yellow bar and the children give an atmosphere. The only downside is that once a bizarre man comes from nowhere and tells me that it is forbidden to do pull-ups because it is a children's park while it is a public park with no sign intended for children of young age (because I am 15 years old so even if it was for a child I have the right) and he then tells me that he will call the police if I come back because he has the cameras. Shady encounter, but he never came back.",1

"I believe Mount Royal park is unique in all aspects! Has trails, view points, bike lanes, piknik spots, events and one of the best thing is the tam-tam music collective on Sundays. The mountain is something we can call the all allowed to do, except for a fire. You can bring your bet, cat, dog and others without a problem just to take care of their necessities. Also it is allowed to drink and smoke weed on Sundays close to the Statue, which is Park Ave. between Ave des Pins and Mont-Royal street.
Every Montrealer should feel lucky in having such an amazing park like Mount Royal.
I hope you enjoy the mountain during the summer. For me the best time to take advantage of summer activities!",1

"This place is more suitable for those nostalgic who have known the ""Parc Belmont"" amusement park which closed its doors definitively in 1983, victim of the success of its nearest competitor ""La Ronde"" located at Ile Ste-H√©l√®ne. Only a piece of land remains where a memorial has been erected with a plaque describing what people could find here for more than 60 years. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the amusement park and its parking lot have been reduced to a piece of land on the waterfront near the Lachapelle bridge, surrounded by residential condos. The place has now become unrecognizable, notice to the nostalgic who plan to return there for the first time since its closure.",1

The park at the end of the street. Always clean. We meet there with friends from the daycare for moments of play. Very good for picnics despite the lack of shadow areas. We also had birthday parties there. Perfect for young and old. Every year there is an evening film screening in summer and a neighborhood party organized by the city. It is the essential place for our end of days from spring to fall.,1

"I did not know that the name ""Parc Belmont"" still existed, I went to see the place, we can not imagine that the Park was there, we feel a nostalgia and the Magic has disappeared !!!! In my humble opinion, they should not have closed, maintaining it would have been very beneficial for the people of the neighborhood, and for all the others coming from elsewhere, I believe that people would have returned to this Park which was warmer , less crowded, it was really nice, magic, better than La Ronde !!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüåüüå∑",0

"Great park, very well equipped and maintained. It s very peaceful and ideal to see wildlife, going for a walk or just relaxing. There isn t any play area for kids but they defenely enjoy looking at deers, birds or just having a break from the busy city life",1
"Bah. It's hard. Really. In fact the park has a lot of potential but I feel it is forgotten. The children's game is minimliste. On the other hand, there is a rotating red that is fun. But the rest leaves something to be desired. Structure more for big kids yes! But not a lot of things to do. There is a large dog park but no play or toy. There is a pateaugoire no shade. And swings for baby. Pity. The city should invest a little more.",0

"It is useful to have a park near your home.  On the other hand, it does not bring much pleasant:  Too close to Boulevard Saint Joseph and a tunnel with lots of vehicles, which makes relaxation impaired by the noise of cars and frequent sirens.  The sports facilities are disappointing: a basketball hoop all by itself on a small piece of land that only allows you to take a few shots without lingering. Basic water games for children ... etc",0

Also the trails that are closed seem to be the nicest/most popular. Didn't get to experience them, and for the same price + poison ivy! Wont be going back. Can't trust the signs, can't trust that it's well maintained, and by reading the comments - can't trust that your car wont get broken into. 0 security, no cameras. Don't risk it!",0

A beautiful park for walking but the snowshoe trails should be distinguished more. People are snowshoeing all over the place and smashing small shrubs along the trail. A very nice place to relax.

very good,1
"I loved the place,it is a place in which you can relax,meet new people, do berbecue...",1
"If you go there to watch The Landscapes, this is not the place. Instead, go to Mont Royal or √éle de la Visitation. If you are curious and want to see how you can turn a landfill into a park where you feel in nature, go there and go there often. Because the park is already very decent but it is not finished. It continues to be in transformation. And that promises! My only criticism (which I have already sent to the City): Need more benches and more toilets. The situation is improving for the benches, but it takes a long time to walk around the park and you want to relax, not want to hold back your desire to go to the bathroom.",1
Great park - something for everyone.,1

Often sharing the common trait of being drunk.

A random little parc, trapped in the chaos of a big street, and the livelihood of a fully alive neighborhood.",1
Free tennis,1
Very clean,1
"A mixed opinion. A site full of potential, on which investments dating from 2005. And abandoned since. For all equipment is 1 park with 3 trash and a bicycle rack. Input displays disappeared.

"A jewel in the heart of the neighborhood, it offers many aspects that can be found in the city, only in large parks. In full leafing, we manage not to distinguish the city from any side (without the noise!) And if ""misleading"" at times. The richness of the smells, the undergrowth, the few wetlands and the fauna completes the portrait. To see if you are in the area. Thanks to everyone who treats this space with respect :)",1

Park under used due to the noise of the factory next door,1
"There are a few little things to say about this park because, for example, the dog park is very sparsely equipped, if not at all, the baseball fields are small and not renovated in addition to the bad smells of manure where I don't know what sort of waste. The cabin is in poor condition",0
Strong medable,1
"Beautiful parc. It's a shame young people gather in the table right next to the kid's playing area to smoke weed, it might be  9 meters from the actual playground (maybe it's not even 9 meters) but why there? There are lots of other benches and tables further away?
Also, there is this one trash can that hasn't been emptied for days and it ruins the whole ambiance",0

"Beautiful park, excellent place for barbecue with friends",1
"Nice park, but lacks shaded areas to sit under. The water games there lack the same shaded spots so while your kid would play in the water you get roasted in the sun. also the single walkway that goes around the park is shared by bikers and pedestrian alike. Few days ago my toddler was almost run over by a novice lady with the bike that lost control and almost fell on my son.",1

"It's a nice park offering different ways of having fun such as a playground, a pool, outdoor workout stations and tennis courts.

Although interdicially cycling, the trails consist of a reinforced 2 m span of rock dust perfectly leveled by a large amount of embankment. This is rather contradictory to the vocation of conservation of the place, decision probably dictated to favor the access to the wheelchairs and to the services of emergencies.",1

The place is unique as well as historical. It is located in downtown of Montreal. The main thing I like about this is the fountain that is cut into half. Other buildings here are very beautiful as there is old architecture on one side and modern on another. It is mesmerizing.,1

Magnificent,1
"Equipped with a fountain overlooking a pretty pond into which it pours, this park will charm you with its great tranquility. Located in a residential area where the speed limit is very limited, you are not likely to be disturbed by traffic. The only downside, the benches are downright uncomfortable; except those who are in the playground, their files amount to a wooden board! For history buffs, note that a monument was erected there in memory of soldiers who fell during the two world wars.",1

This parc borders St-Antoine on north, on east is rue Laporte, on west is rue Agnes, one street west of Imperial Tobacco on rue St-Antoine, and rue Irene is Parc St-Henri. Some spaced out parc benches, further south is rue St-Jacques, runs west from the glen to rue Atwater oneway going east, to Atwater Market, and this Parc is approx. 7-9 streets West of rue Atwater and rue St-Antoine. There has been much renovations, and Condo development is going forward well into the future. This Parc hss been there for well over 100 years plus possibly. Go site explore snd walk around St-Henri Parc, famous people have grown up here. Famous names to name a fewI I know of, like Oscar Peterson and family, Rufus Rockhead, coach Pat Burns and family, and many more Celebs. St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church is still there on rue Couvent and St-Antoine, the English. Catholic boys and girls shool has since been replaced with a French school now. Go take a tour, please. St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church now is a Salle de R√©ception, renovations complete, opens today thurs, june 12-19, beautiful d√©cor all white with beautiful chandeliers hanging from the high old church ceiling. Valet parking, what a change and note of memories growing up here.",1

The hiking trails are gorgeous (but nothing extraordinary about them). The view from the top of the mountain was absolutely breathtaking, hence why I gave them a 4 star. So overall, if you're visiting Montreal for the first time, I would definitely recommend this place.",1

Friendly environment,1

My favorite park of montreal by far. Tip: there is a skating track.,1
Ice skating here was very fun. You can rent skates and then head to one of the portables to change your shoes. Getting on the ice was hard as there are no guardrails at a place that's not a rink. But all in all it was a very unique skating experience.,1

There are often a good breeze here ans sitting here is nice. The neighborhood is poor so you can expect some people with less money spending more than then they should in the part, but it‚Äôs not bothering.",1
"It is a large park to be visited on foot, by bicycle and by scooter. There are electrical outlets to recharge your scooter batteries. Sometimes you can see deer. There are some parking lots for cars. It is a wonderful natural park.",1
Good change this park but nice to go,1
Great family hideout close to mtl street however there are often times people passed out after a night of party and or different communities using the water park for hygenic purposes which I am actually ok with but it might not be your thing if you have small kids with you. When with the kido we opt out for water parks that are kids only.,0
Nice hill for snow activities in winter and nice view during summer,1
You cannot bring your dog in any part in St-Leonard. It really sucks.,0
"Ideal for cooling off, very friendly little park.",1

"Great place to relax, enjoy a nice picnic, you can even bring a bbq, play frisbee, soccer, watch people do gymnastics or watch them play dress up to have fun fights.

"Children's playground, sports field, football, soccer, baseball, etc.",1
"In summer, you cycle there, winter, cross-country skiing and sledding, don't miss the trills in spring. Free parking on the street near the entrance to the fields (south west). Only problem: difficult to prevent pedestrians and their dogs from trampling and vandalizing the cross-country ski trails near Summerlea Street.",1

Very good to see events,1
"Nice park but in summer the swimming pool is guarded by a handful of little capos, students working 2 months a year, feeling invested with a repressive mission with loud whistles. In less than 10 minutes we were scolded like children on ten occasions. The first to prevent our little one from using the slide. While we were consoling her tears we were hissed a second time by a kid on her perch forbidding our 3 year old child to cling to my head and / or my back. In short, we are not here to laugh, have fun or relax. Young people if working in the summer already makes you so bitter ... I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your professional lives.",0
Excellent,1

The only thing I dislike is that ppl don't preserve the park conditions.",1
"Main attraction, the boardwalk or Grande Passerelle, doesn't exist anymore, also meaning that the principal circuit or loop end in a cul-de-sac. Deception for the kids. The beach is also closed. Overall, you can walk but don't expect any special ¬´view"". People have to write ¬´You are here"" themselves on the maps so it's understandable. This Park is not maintain or what it used to be. For around 10$ for parking, kind of a deception in 2020.",0

Okay park! Not worth a visit but hey if you are around.,0
Park once magnificent in decay. The fountain is open only a few weeks a year. There is a lot of rubbish and the metro station brings a lot of unsavory people.

Too bad we can not see the sun go down since there are big towers to condos in front.,0

Everything for family action,1
No playground for kids,1
Beautiful and large park to forget that you live in a metropolis for an afternoon,1
"If you are in Montreal and would like to see a corner of nature, make the detour! It's really worth a look! The park as such deserves a little more maintenance in my humble opinion. Still, venturing off the beaten track will provide you with an out-of-the-ordinary experience. We feel the spirit of the nature of Montreal that is unfortunately increasingly rare nowadays. With the extension of the highway the place has lost some of its charm but still cash well with its relief and its prominent vegetation.",1

Other grassy fields for soccer and whatever other leisurely activities you wish to engage in. A skating rink. Paved paths along the park for biking, walking, running.

"A park crossed by a highway, a railroad and a street and tottaly flooded at the time I was there. You can listen though to the birds chirping... on the background of the highway noises. That's something special! A plus would be the dogs allowed in the park in leashes which are barking at you. One of the rare parks I would not recommend in Great Montreal area in any season. There are many other much better.",0

There's also too many dogs off leash in the eastern wooded part of the park. Drug paraphernalia is also very present. Creepy sex offenders seem to enjoy the secluded areas as well as the parking lot. On the upside there's a great kids playground sheltered from the Sun by the shade of large trees.",0

Small park where you can enjoy some paintings.,0
Nice and clean,1
"I like this little park very much. With many trees around it makes it a very pleasant place on warmer days. But because there are many houses nearby, cats circulate around the park and many of them make their needs in the sand, so I don't advise digging too much there. Also remembering that it is a place far from any other attractions (swimming pools, water games, outdoor theaters) precisely because it is within a small residential area.",0
"Really this is what this park is called? Everyone I know calls it Central Park.
Besides that, it's a nice place and there's ducks that (I believe) come out of their own free will... And snacks from the visitors.",1

"This little park is a great place to meditate, the traffic isn't too loud due to low speeds. It's tranquil",1
"The most beautiful nature park in Montreal, by far! Especially, especially, no cursed highway nearby. Nothing but birdsong, the soft murmur of water, the smell of earth and plants. From the mature forest (I even discovered a Western cedar whose trunk is easily 60 cm in diameter at the base, the crown bleached by age and could well be millennia), a beautiful beach, a farm organic , picturesque panoramas on Lake Deux-Montagnes. For lovers of beautiful and long hiking (about 25 km), on a beautiful Sunday morning (avoid the week or Saturday), go around the cape, then walk to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue by the path of Senneville, an unforgettable campaign in the city! In addition, it is accessible by public transport, at the point of departure, and at the finish. I'm over 70 years old, and it's been around 25 years that I make the trip, at least once a year, at the end of summer. To discover absolutely!",1

Perfect,1
"Its a good park for sport pool, football, üèÄ and soccer.",0
"Well I live nearby since 2012 and I must say that it has nothing to do with what i've heard in previous years. The City and some not-for-profit organizations have invested into making this parc a very family-friendly place. There's a refrigerated ice rink, lots of seating, a nice pool, soccer field and kid's playground. Some of my neighbors, who have been in the area for 50 years, told me that the place has evolved a lot since all of the investments in the park and it keeps getting better.",1

The dog love it and the waterfountain for them is great ! ( the park is all rocks and no grass for anyone wondering ) üòä,1
Nice place to walk,1
"The cross-country ski trails are very poorly marked and maintained, it is difficult to find and follow them. moreover they are not traced often enough which causes the snow to cover them and they disappear ... It is very disappointing that for one of the large parks in Montreal, we do not put the same level of effort as Maisonneuve or Mont-Royal parks to offer good ski conditions to citizens. It's not just Outremont or Westmount where people like to get outdoors and play sports. Even in Villeray and Saint-Michel there are some! In addition, at the moment the path is closed behind the TAZ skatepark. There is a detour to take through the multiple parking lots and along Papineau Street. Anyway, I won't be going back anytime soon. Also, I would like to know if the people in charge of the maintenance of the park have already skied in their park?",0

"I've lived near this park my whole life. The football field still has issues, and has been replaced by a new field at the center of the racetrack. The playground itself has seen better days, and probably (definitely) needs a refresh. The facilities are adequate, but again, need refreshing. The running track itself is in fairly good condition thus far. Give it a few years, I'm certain it will fall into the state of disrepair it was in previously. This is LaSalle afterall.",1

It is situated in what is called old Riviere-des-Prairies (RDP), which is a surprising little village at the east end of the island of Montreal. The park, as also that part of town, will be a pleasant surprise for those who visit because it challenges the concept of RDP being a ""suburban-style"" part of town. Worth discovering!",1
Good music and great atmosphere,1

McDonald Park is a pretty big park right smack-dab in the middle of the west side of the city. it's been there for years and has a lot of square footage. You can see people doing all sorts of events in the park and they even put up a lighted skating that I could see for my tall luxury high-rise at night time. Very well lit. With nobody there most of the time.  at the North end of the park and I don't know why that in particular late but it seems to have a lot of dog walking people.it's like a circle of dog socialization but not a dog run nobody releases their dog off the leash or they shouldn't. It's a popular Park surrounded by residential homes and generally speaking it's fairly quiet with homes and church and synagogue kitty-cornering it in a couple of places.  We need more parks and open spaces in Montreal so it's great to have this one.,1
Nice patk ; play ground ; baseball field and tennis court,1
It's a Great Park in to go walking running hiking and doing outdoor exercises in the morning as well as evening and it has a beautiful water pond,1

An ice rink occupies one of two baseball fields.  The park includes a playground for children and babies accompanied by many benches. A path for bicycles and others crosses the park with several branches that one can choose. A pet game is in the middle near the youth house.  The park also has an impressive number of Pok√©Stop if you like Pok√©mon GO.",1

Paths are well made for everyone to walk or to jog or to hike .. or to ski during winter. In summer time , you can BBQ with your family... or simply walk and take pictures of nature... or simply rest and tan your awesome body on the Hills or Lac Des Castors. There is also a place where you can see the city view of Montreal if you walk all the way up to the north side ( just follow everyone ).

"Excellent park

ACCESS: Great for getting to by car, bus or metro, bike or walking. Angrignon Metro Station adjacent as well as bus routes. There are two parking lots. The south one accessible from La Verandrye is less busy and free.

SIZE: Big for a city park. Plenty of walkways & trails, big space so you don't feel everyone is ever bunched together.

NATURE: Lots of trees and a lake. You can find squirrels, many types of birds and if you're lucky a few other animals as well. Seasonal native flowers, plenty of shade.

SERVICES: Public bathrooms, benches (although many are out in the sun) , a dog park for dogs to play & run around in and there used to be a snack bar in the main building which decades ago was a small zoo (there was even an elephant in the 1980s!)

WHEN TO GO: Year-round. In winter it's a good nature walk, skating on the lake and beats being indoors. In spring lots of new buds & flowers, you see a lot of photographers taking pictures. Summer people sunbathe, walk around, bikeride, enjoy the sights near the lake. Fall is great for foliage, trees change colours.

RAINY DAYS: If you ever take a walk in a rainy day you will see a lot of animals because they are less bothered by people.

All in all a great place to enjoy nature in the city as this is one of Montreal's largest green spaces and easily accessible in any way.",1

Great park for family with small kids!,1
"A place where is in the middle of the downtown of Montreal. Easily accessible to all the pedestrian. Or else people who want to relax and sit for a while to enjoy the surrounding area. It looks good to be there. Because it is all surrounded by the trees and sitting benches for the people. I do not like the people sleeping on the benches kept for the people to sit on. I think that, people who do not have home they come and spend their most of their time sitting on the benches or sleeping. This can create a issue for others who want to sit there. If we have some food with us then peacocks and other birds will come to join the party. If we give some food to them.",1

"If you're looking for a safe and fun halloween, THIS is where you want to be.  The whole park is converted into a themed halloween.  Last year it was Day of the Dead (tastefully done for little ones) activities, candy stations, haunted house, many MANY entertainers, fireworks and cherry on my sundae... the spotlights everywhere give off enough heat to make it comfortable for everyone.

The neighbouring streets have an 80% participation.  Hoises are decorated, people standing outdoors in costume handing out candy.  It feels like we're back in the 80s when it was safe to trick or treat, kids flooded the streets and people talked to each other.

I have been coming here with my kid since 2011 and plan to keep coming here until he says ""mom... im too old to trick or treat"".

Try it - you won't regret it.",1

"A park at the edge of the water in Verdun unmissable. Modifications have been made to make this park more family friendly over the years, but upkeep leaves a lot to be desired.  The water games platform is crooked and the land is still flooded, the children's park is in complete disrepair, there is a lack of benches, the abrevoirs are almost useless.

I love this little park at all seasons,1
The children's games section is really great. There are many different items. There is a good atmosphere between parents and children.  The outdoor pool is also not bad even if the changing rooms would require a little facelift.

There are also the very popular hammock stand in this park.,1

A truly excellent place to relax on a nice day.

The one point of contention is the amphitheater, which seems like a promising venue, but which is very run-down.  I've never seen or heard of any performances being staged in this venue, which strikes me as unfortunate, given its potential.",1

"Was able to get lost in it for 8 years!

That's a lot to say for a Montreal park.

Edit: sorry for the security guard who will find my cabin. Started only by a day off in the park and ended up living in my cabin for 8 years. 1 days was rough but then i build my little shelter little by little. First it was only a roof, then i build a wall (big DT fan here), then i wanted a window so i build one. Then came the bathroom and washroom, then a couple of person came in so i built a group room, then had a vending machine company get some profit from my cabin and since came by i gave them water fountain. Now its a great little cabin located right in front of the Saputo stadium, on the other side of the street.
Still amazed i got away with it and it still secret to the authority. Hope nobody find it because its my little secret place. Come by if you want a quick drink or anything. Its open to everyone!",1

"It is great to see the north section of the square finished with the two Bridges and the incomplete cut off fountain. This is an excellent work of my favorite landscape architect, Claude Cormier. In a Sunday afternoon at the beginning of Autumn the place was a perfect postcard: young families with strollers, tourists taking pictures and squirrels running and jumping around. The trees were showing hints of what is going to be their coloring in a few weeks time. A great place to start a downtown discovery walking tour.",1

It's a cozy nice park that has everything you looking for.,1
"From what I understand, the intention of the park is to remember the AIDS crisis, it's not a ""feel-good"" sort of place.  This is a solemn and serious subject, and the park's design engenders this feeling.  It's not a question of like our dislike, it's simply a slightly somber area.",0

"NDG Park is one of the better green spaces in NDG. It covers a large area and is great for people of all sorts - families, couples, groups, and individuals. If you need a quiet corner, it's easy to find and if you're looking for some socializing there are plenty of people just hanging out. Large trees, shade, well balanced with other large open areas. There's a kiddie area with plenty of swings etc. and a water playground for hot summer days. In the winter, there's an outdoor hockey rink that the city sets up.There also is an enclosed dog area that is large and dogs can roam free and play with other doggies. There's a subsection to keep the smaller dogs away from the big ones.",1
Very placid corner in Montreal. Magnificent views of the Saint-Laurent river.,1

Really pretty park with a nice fountain and tons of squirrels,1
"For me, the most beautiful site in Montreal! Accessible by car, but I strongly suggest to go there by bike since the Bicycle path of Berges passes there. To get there by bike from the east, you will follow the banks of Verdun and Lasalle and from the west, the banks of Lachine. The island is a sanctuary for migratory birds such as the Canada Goose. You can see the birds but also an impressive variety of flowers, shrubs and fruit aquatic plants, not to mention the rapids on the south side of the island. You can picnic and fish there (restrictions to read at the entrance of the site). Perfect to go relax or meditate.",1
The square is pretty and there are lots of activities offered by the city on weekends. It's cool.  We see people smoking crack there at 3 p.m. Less cool.,1

Nice ride !!,1
"Small picnic among the birds, very pleasant!",1
Visited recently in winter which is a totally different landscape than summer. The whole experience was like walking in a winter wonderland and I wish I brought skiis! People who did will have an easier time getting around though walking is fine in winter boots. The less popular paths didn't have snow paved so just be careful. Views are beautiful with snow on the trees and paths. Very calming visit.,1

"Wide open spaces with something for everyone. Plenty of mature trees, rolling green hills and foliage in the summer. Excellent splash pad for the kiddies on one end, skate park for the young at heart on the other. Only thing lacking is a proper crossing between the park's two halves. Think twice before dodging cars with the little ones - might be why they stationed cop cars there last time we went.",1

Very informative for kids and adults we enjoyed alot,1

Perfect for large events. Like gay pride ...,1
Very nice park.,1
"This park is almost pleasant when you come there during the week early in the morning when the daycares have not yet come to invade them. However, for parents of young children three and under, I would not recommend this park in the afternoon. The children who come there are large, numerous and unsupervised. There are those who started throwing sand in my daughter's face, insulting her and pushing her around without any parental intervention. So I yelled at him. Why do I have to do this? Is it because we're in the heart of the ghetto or what? WTF?",0
Withdrawal space not far from the city ... It's a pity that there are not many trails,0
Breath-taking architecture... Just wonderful.,1
Its a nice small park surrounded by beatiful houses of Montreal.,1

Simple but safe for 2 to 6,0
Magnificent in season listening!,1
"It is difficult to transit with a manual wheelchair. Drinking water station inaccessible. Montreal Full Circus is a beautiful festival, but the free shows in the Square are discouraging due to the lack of accessibility, as well as the lack of civility of the spectators who are standing in front of the seated people.",0
Beautiful park,1
"A beautiful vantage point to view the fireworks or just to have a picnic. A few barbeques are scattered around the center and a clean bathroom at the entrance.
You can see Parc Jean Drapeau on one side and the old port on the other, although the best view is of both at the point.
It is a popular fishing spot where the odd meter long sturgeon can be spotted jumping out of the water resulting in a spectacle you don't see every day.",1
"Great parc with kids playground and water jets, a restaurant and a bike path that extends to the rest of the parks by the water in Verdun and LaSalle.

Good spot to relax all around as well as appreciate the views of the river. There's even a dock with some boats and there's many spots along the river where people fish.",1

"I go there often It is calm and pleasant  Why only 3 stars?  Because ""fishermen"" go to the edge of the water and leave their son on the spot as well as empty containers of worms, cans, cigarette butts, wrappings of all kinds, empty plastic bags etc etc ... I even photographed plastic pads on the shore ... yuck!  I'm sick of these disrespectful people ... It's been several times that I go to the edge of the water between the building of city shore and the bridge and that I put the waste of these disrespectful humans of our planet in bags and that I deposit these bags in the trash of the park .. .  Shame on you guys !!! Respect yourself And respect the others grrrr",0
Compared to his placement and the space reserved for children is too small especially if we coincide with day care,0

Fabulous summer festival üòò,1
New developments since spring 2017. Very nice water games for young children. This park will continue its metamorphosis in the coming years. The dog park next door still remains a problem since it often happens that dogs on the loose are close enough.,1
It smells really bad.,0
Strange place where it is good to take a walk. There is space to have the famous 2 meter distance.,1

"The park: 5 stars. The park for dogs: 0 star. Populated by people who drink and smoke pot without being too careful with their dogs. Dogs that are sometimes aggressive ... 80% of the time you go it's fine, but if you fall at the wrong time, be careful if you have a small dog, it's risky. I will avoid going back there unless they open a 2nd section for small dogs like elsewhere. It would avoid unnecessary risks.",0

Went there during winter and their skiing mountain is so inviting. The place is very clean. The snow is so white. But the staff in the container van is not so friendly. I asked for some information about the Pente a Neige and one guy stopped me while I was talking to the other kid staff saying that the information is there everything on the website. Very disrespectful. Very lazy man I wasn't even talking to him. I was so disappointed lazy people like him are hired for this kind of job.,1
My dog ‚Äã‚Äãloved this place where he made some friends.,1
"this summer I had the privilege of walking on this very pleasant little beach! to my surprise and to everyone's pleasure there was a group of musicians that day like (TAMTAM) who made us nice melodies, moreover they lent us instruments to participate in their melodies!

"It is an artificial lake in the middle of residential area.
As someone visiting, it feels wonderful in seeing resident building by one side, and water at the other. It must be a money costing project. To please the eyes , it is successful. To create an environment that will attract living creatures, it is doing well. I saw Canada goose, duck and fish. I am very sure that there should be frogs hiding somewhere to help cleaning up the mosquito too.
This is early spring. Water is clear and air is fresh. Wind is blowing. Flowers will soon come. Also, there are people jogging along the lake and children passing by with parents.
The fungshui is good for this season.
Will come back when the season changes.",1

Mehhhhh,0
Nice view! The only negative point is too many sc seals in some places.,1

Enchanting place. But I would settle on the tennis court. Although being a wonderful place to play it. The lights are on the last non-functional courts and partially non-functional on the 4-5-6 courts. The 1-2-3 is perfect. The grounds 1 2 and e are very dirty and this time the city does not have the reason for the floods for this unfortunate let go. The grounds are to be redone because there is a lot of dead zone on the grounds. Despite everything for the day for a while still it is pleasant to play it. But if nothing is done it would not last.,0
A nice place! You think you are in a fairy tale!,1
On my way from work,1

Great family park,1
Hidden gem!,1
Park Gamelin is great because during the summer there are lots of events including karaoke and dancing nights.

Just watch out because you can fall. There's a tall balcony there to watch the water run and then just relax. You can also get food/drinks from the nearby restaurants/shops. You sit on a rock, close your eyes and relax. Take a deep breath then listen to the water run. Only silence, which is relaxing. It is also safe, don't worry. There's security guards on patrol there, so don't be afraid. Very good to study, relax, ride a bike or just run. The picture below is the scenery at night time. Magnificent.",1

Great views of the city. I don't recommend walking up from the north through the cemetery when it's icy especially if you don't have the proper footwear. Crampons or boots with treads recommended.,1

I played soccer and really loved it,1
Very beautiful park with an extraordinary view of Montreal. Several events take place there during the summer. Unmissable tourist place during your stay in Montreal.,1
"This park has great potential for the children living near by although it is not adequately laid out. It's divided in three sections and the southernmost is separated by Boulevard Rosemont where cars tend to speed. Crossing lights will be a great way of improving safe access to the park.
Installations could be improved or used differently. Baseball diamond is a total waste of space.
Sliding slope could be made just a bit higher for greater fun during winter time.
What's good: playground for kids, football pitches (artificial), swimming pool (indoors), skate park and upcoming pataugeoire.
What's missing: trees & shade, picnic tables, trekfit installation (this is a must have for this park).",0
Calm down!,1
Nice calm park with many trails for pedestrians and bikers. It is also a great spot to go cross-country skiing on the island of Montreal. Recommend going there about 1 hour before sunset as there is less people at that time.,1

"I went to the riverside park to exercise at 6 o'clock this afternoon. I don‚Äôt know what organization was taking up the entire playground. They kept escorting us away, completely occupying the entire playground to engage in their movements. They asked us to leave in a very rude language, and the attitude was very tough. However, when we came in, we did not see any announcement telling us that the playground was closed today. I really want to complain about them. But I don't know what organization they are and who is responsible. I only know that they were already there at 6 o'clock in the afternoon of 2019-06-12. I feel very angry. Other friends also feel unhappy.",0

"My wife, my daughter and I went for a photo shoot of my wife's pregnancy while she was pregnant with our 2nd child. A very charming place when you venture into the trails. The reception is rather cold when you arrive. A building in the middle of a large lot where the only big trees are on the outskirts of the land. My first impression was not very favorable but once engaged in the trails, we found the place really very pretty and pleasant. A park in town that is worth seeing.",1

"I lived my youth around there and my Grandma used to bring me to the Expos games. I was very young but she taught me everything about baseball lol. Then in 3rd grade, our teacher brought us to a  game. Then in High School I'd gather up with the guys cause I was now playing baseball with them and go often to see the Expos in the bleachers for $0.50 lol. I had my children around there still and brought them in the playground, we had 2 skating rinks 1 for hockey and 1 for free skating which I skated with my 2 sons and in the summer they played baseball and after we'd go swim in the small pool and growing up and go to the big pool. I have so many good memories. I even remember when my granddaddy brought me at the park, I was about 5 years old and taught me to fly a quite several times and go on the swings and pushed me, just as I did with my kids. My parents still live around there. It's been 58 years. And only good things happened. Specially to go and see several concerts. Genesis, Elton John, I think Supertramp and so many others. And of course Tennis became one of the biggest event. Just awesome living close by.",1

"Notre Dame de Grace is a fine residential area, with some older brick houses, in streets canopied by beautiful large trees, and a few ""in"" streets for shopping and lounging in quaint cafes and authentic ethnic eateries.  A Montreal quarter with a unique character of its own. It also goes down to the part of Sherbrook street with its good stores, and restaurants.  Some of the restaurants and cafes have sidewalk seating too.  Parking might be hard to find at times.  Enjoy your visit!",1

One of them is equipped with water so kids can splash aroundüòÇ there are 2 baseball playgrounds and some paths in between when you could go for a run.

"Arrived on site for an event to find a car broken into. We immediately report it to the park security, who dont care and say it is the police's problem. We then report it to a passing patrol car, who doesn't care because we don't own the vehicle and just leaves the remainder of this person's belongings unprotected. Finally we get it announced at the event as a last desperate attempt to help this person,who I'm certain had a much worse day than us. So obvious these people aren't here to protect us....",0
A very big and beautiful park. Close to shopping center and train station.,1

It caters to a plethora of interests: free swimming pool, quality soccer field, tennis courts, basketball, rollerblading, sunbathing, lots of picnic and frisbee space, baseball section, theatre plays or concerts in the summer, safe areas for kids (separate pool). During winter there's country skiing, free skating rink and hockey rinks. Better maintenance of its main walking roads during winter would earn the 5th star.",1
"Very nice park. In the summer especially when it is very hot, in the shade of large trees it is possible to settle with the children to spend the day with a picnic. Wooden tables and benches allow us to be properly installed. Not to mention the large outdoor pool.",1
One place you must never miss if you are planning for a visit at Montreal (Mount Royal üëë),1

Happy new year,1

"The experience:
Visited the park during spring 2021. The trails leading up to the great house and lookout has beautiful trees and lots of birds and some wildlife. It is definitely a closer walk to nature in the middle of the city. The walk from parking to the top is approximately 15 mins at regular pace with kids. At the top of the lookout you are able to see all of downtown Montreal, The historic bridges and the harbour. If you have binoculars I highly recommend bringing them.

Other:
There were bathrooms on site, I can't speak to cleanliness though. And there's a small cafe that sells coffee and a few small food items. But bring your own water though, prices are touristy.",1
Very nice park with lots of water in summer and lots of ways to ice skate in the winter,1
"The water side is not so impressive surprisingly. The nicer area is the woods area. I recommend starting at the Welcome center off Henry Bourassa in VSL.

"I really like this park as it has a lot to offer for everyone. Families and friends gather and they can just relax on the park, have a picnic and even play games. They also have a few courts to play, baseball, volleyball and more. I also find that in the warm summer weather, this location is quite cool that you can even sleep on the grass. One other perk is that it's close to popular restaurants if you're willing to line up.",1

Nice place to walk alone or with family,1
"This is possibly one of the most unsafest/dirtiest parks in Mtl as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't always like this many decades ago, but alas, now it's simply not the same anymore which is sad because the park itself has immense potential. You'll often encounter dog 'residue' or loitering all over the place) on your path if you care to take a stroll. Unfortunately, this park is not only gross, but dangerous. Despite the police station (pdq) 38 being across the street, it doesn't stop questionable crowds from discouraging people from going to squat for a picnic or a night walk. Don't let your children play or go there alone.",0

There is art and a cute museum and the Biosphere which has a good exhibit outside even if you decide not to go into the main museum. Really pretty spot to hang out around the fountain/pool outside when it's sunny. A great view of the city from the island also. There is an amusement park if that's your thing as well. We had a lovely day and I recommend doing this either as a local or tourist.",1

"Viger Square was built to hide Autoroute Ville Marie, a major highway that crosses and divides Montreal's downtown. Built on top of the highway, it manages to hide large swaths of it and plays the more important role of keeping the upper and lower parts of downtown from being disconnected. The square has fallen on hard times and needs a major renovation. One interesting tidbit is the presence of large crabapple trees that carry edible fruit which ripens around the beginning of September.",0
It's no longer the shadow of itself,0

"I would've given zero stars if I could. When we were back from our 1 hour walk to the parking lot, we saw that somebody shattered the rear window and robbed our car. This is the Mont√© de l'√©glise entrance. There is no security camera, no guard, no booth, whatsoever. I wonder why they charge the 7-9$ parking fee, when there is no security there. If I wanted my car to be robbed, I would have parked it somewhere else for free... This parking lot is clearly the SPOT for this particular thief and seems to be doing it often, as this entrance is practically in the middle of nowhere and the closest bodyshop said that they have one case like this every week. AVOID going there and if you do go there, empty your car first. The place is not safe at all.",0

Like all the other parks in this area they are boring. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the green spaces but can we use them. There are so many parts of this park that are just never used. Can they put at least walking paths through them and if you venture through them beware of dog poop. There are a lot of dogs in this neighbourhood why not give them a fenced in area,0
Super place for chiller,1

very huge park with a a great view,1
"Situated right behind a couple of buildings that are occupied by various offices of the municipality of Montreal, Champ-de-Mars is called a park probably because of a lack of a better term to describe it. I would describe it as a public space that consists of no more than one long alley/walkway, a row of poplar trees, a few benches and a large green lawn. It's still a very pleasant place to sit and chill on a warm day.",1

Great safe fenced in parks for children of all ages 3 different jungle gyms and a sprinkler!

Being one of the longer ones, it offers a wider variety of panoramas, but the best ones remain those that you get on the river. I would have given it 5 stars had the riverfront been cleaner, but the municipality does precious little maintenance on its parks, especially those that do not attract large crowds.",1

"Nice park by river drive with kids play area and courts for different games., good place for a weekend outing with family",1
"Vraiment un bijou au pied du Stade Olympique et voisin du jardin botanique.  Sa topographie trahit un peu son ancienne vocation, mais les cyclistes autant que les pique-niqueurs y trouvent leur compte.  Un plan d'eau compl√®terait √† merveille le portrait.  Rien n'est parfait.",1

We love this park. A lot places for any activities. A cool playground..,1
It's very beautiful,1
Nice skatepark to try,1
They renovated this park in 2017. It is a cool small neighborhood park for the kids. The water play is very small and showing its age. The design of having bigger kids biking and skating through the toddler's area is a flaw and a accident waiting to happen. Thankfully most parents that visit the park are responsible.,1
A new park is there is a beautiful forest!  That's wonderful !,1
Nice park area in downtown Montreal and info service available.,1

"Great place for a walk. It reminds visitors what wetlands are without having to leave Montreal. While not in the city center, getting there in a car takes little effort. Parking a car in the neighborhood around the park is easy and costs nothing. Take a quick visit to the park center/chalet for information on what would be of most interest to you. I recommend packing a mosquito repellent because wetlands are natural breeding grounds for a range of insects.",1
Great quiet little park with two seperate Bocce courts. One of the little gems scattered around the neighbourhood in Rosemont,1

"Fantastic park for going for a walk or a picnic in the summer. In the winter there is a large outdoor ice rink and two small hockey rinks (you can rent skates or bring your own for a fee). In the summer there are also various performances (such as dance shows, theatre, movies) several times a week, free of charge. There are tennis courts, p√©tanque play areas, beach volleyball, a soccer field, a baseball field, and even an enclosed dog park. There‚Äôs also a large field to play whichever sport you want (in front of the dog park, probably need to book it unless no one is using it) and plenty of space to play outdoor games or make bbq, though it can get crowded despite how large the park is. And of course there‚Äôs a large pond with a fountain and ducks. You don‚Äôt even need to come with food ‚Äî there‚Äôs Ma Poule Mouill√©e and La Banquise right next to it and a d√©panneur to buy drinks. Pretty much everything you would ever want from a park.",1

"Outremont has many nice parks. I often walk across Parc Beaubien but I am never tempted to stop there. It is well kept, has a little waterfall and pond, a few tables for picnic, children playgrounds. But it is located between a high school and the busy Cote Sainte Catherine road and does not have many benches to sit down. It is alright but not the finest in Outremont.",1

Just clean up after yourself, place your empties next to the garbage for the collectors or take them home!!",1

Make sure you bring a GAS bbq.",1
My favourite park in Montreal by far! Very peaceful and relaxing,1
Marvelous,1

Not a good place for snowshoeing at all. The trails were not identified on the spot and not findable. There are only founders and the roads are damned for them. Not recommended for snowshoeing.,0

Very good place to enjoy morning trail,1
"Great place for snow shoeing, cross country skiing and walking. Some of the trails are closed and the markings are hard to figure out in certain places.

The only downfall is that parking is 9$ for the day (7$ for 2h).",1

There is a volleyball court but in the sand there are stones that can hurt easily if you jump hard (something common in volleyball jumping high)  Then there was a park employee who wanted to charge us a few dollars per person in my group to use the land.  We told him that we were going to pay nothing and that we were going to go to another park In the end he said it was a joke and that it was to make people laugh well joke bad taste and I wonder if there have been people who have already been fooled.,0

In 1615, he climbed the Ottawa River, the Mattawa River and the French River until he reached Georgian Bay on Lake Huron on August 1, 1615. After a stay in Huron land, a military mission the conduit to the south.¬†He leaves Huronia and descends the Trent River to the United States today.¬†An injury forced him to spend the winter of 1615-16 in the Wendat between Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe, a very populous area, which remains equally magnificent.",1

I never heard so many people breathing out load for going up the stairs. then you can take a good rest and get all the photos you want. the view is just breath taking. You can just get to any area of the park, by bus and just keep walking.",1

One external and one internal hockey ar√©nas.

"This lush green island flanks the south-eastern shore of Montreal island and provides access to the circuit Gilles Villeneuve (formula 1 race track) and a variety of bucolic outdoor open spaces where you can take a break from the summer heat of the city. Bring a picnic and get there by bicycle or public transport to avoid parking fee. Beautiful waterways and open spaces also lead to a variety of open-air exhibits as well as the Biodome and an Acquatic complex, which features three exterior swimming pools. The annual international fireworks competitions are held here, as are a number of live concerts. Sunday afternoons during the summer feature DJs who spin international electronic music at ""Picnic electronique"", which provides a real groove for the end of your summer weekends.",1
I love this piece of action grass for kids and our dogs,1
Calm ! Except the cries of some savages who come from the tennis court.,1

Amazing new playground,1
Beautiful park in the middle of Le Plateau. It has a central park vibe to it. It offers lots of activities ranging from sightseeing to organized sports. It's definitely a park to see in Montreal.,1
This used to be my favorite nature walk period but after 2 years of construction we still haven't finished and the park is partly closed. I expect it will take at least 5 years for Nature to repair all the damage and return to the original beauty. So sad.,0
"Nice park for walks and jogging. There is a path to follow to go up Mont Royal and also a path around the park. Water fountains and bathroom are on site but not very clean.
There are several tennis courts and availability is not bad. It's outdoor and only available in the summer. There is also a big turf field that's usually reserved for organized games but we always manage to find a spot on the field to play on weekends. The park is dog friendly. Tam-tam park is across the street and lots of fun on Sundays.",1

"large and suberpe borough park. The best equipped I have seen. Chalet, toilets (but never open), water games, real climbing wall, sports equipment, exercise equipment for adults, winter sports and several varied play modules. All very recent and located in a new development.  There is also a beautiful and too rare artistic integration. In addition one can contemplate a view of the mountains surrounding the metropolis.  The park is animated with various activities during the year.  Unfortunately, and I hope to be wrong for the future, the place seems conducive to acts of vandalism.  In short, a model park.",1

"Being the neighbor of the most famous square in Montreal is not easy. Place de la Dauversiere is ignored by most, but you shouldn't. If you are looking for a little shade and a place to relax, just a few feet away from the hustle and bustle of Place Jacques Cartier, this public garden will do just fine. The garden contains the statue of Jean Drapeau, the most famous local mayor in the modern history of Montreal. Mr. Drapeau's statue is strategically placed in the square that is right in front of city hall.",1

"Well.... at first I got conned.  By someone on facebook who was selling me tickets illegally and I didn't catch on until too late.  So that was a super bummer.

Then,  I found a legit person, referred to me, who sells tickets for a living... then I finally got the wristbands and all the required paperwork.

I'm glad that music festival organisers make it difficult to get these tickets otherwise everyone would be ripped off continuously and without reservation.

The problem left is getting the monies over to the actual artists that are performing instead of all the organizers and music labels getting Most if not almost ALL the money from record, song, festival, and streaming sales.  It is QUITE the racket... the music industry.   And I am very sad for the musicians, who are the ones who lose out.

Only went one day, Sunday and saw the Fontaines D.C. (who were AMAZING...and I believe they will become HUGE).  Then Monolink, DJ Kruz, Hozier (whom I do not like), Tame Impala (LOVE), Childish Gambino (some songs ...not all), Boy Pablo (what a beautiful voice!), and a few other random musical acts.

Felt like the festivals grounds was more of a fairgrounds than geared towards music festival goers.  Been a long long time since I've been to a community local fair, but with all the booze-pushing salespeople and all the pushers of whatever...it really felt like I was at the circus rather than a music festival.

I did, however, like the options for healthy food instead of just hotdogs all the time.  Poutine??  Ummmmm.... No.... I do not eat Poutine.  That is THE most fattening food on the planet earth... hands down... hahahaaaa...  I will allow others to enjoy it tho...just leave me out of that.

Festivals goers seemed pretty occupied with themselves and their phones.  Or themselves and their specific ""wolf pack"".  Pretty oblivious bunch of people.  Will run into you or over you and will not care.

Maybe if there was a real dress code...and that is to dress UP, not down... and people would care more about running into others.

Coachella does a better job of inspiring people to dress UP.  It's nice when people do.  Much prettier humans to look at and it improves the entire festival experience.

Dress UP Montreal.",0
"Very pretty and expansive park, lots of different kinds of people visiting and going for walks :) The animals there are very tame! Not sure if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing, but it‚Äôs noteworthy",1

Beautiful park with space to sit. This winter there was a nice track to skate,1
Great for walking with the baby while visiting the city,1
"A small park with quite good facilities for kids (summer only). There is a circular trail, with views opening onto the Prairies River. The only downside is the large volume of trash left by less considerate picnickers and ""anglers"". A variety of wildlife can be seen for those with the patience to wait at the waterside, including turtles, loons, squirrels, marmots, kingfisher, geese, ducks and overgrown koi carp. Busy on the weekends, in summer a grill spot should be grabbed as early as possible. Covered area for bad weather, easy paths, and relative isolation will please most. Please ensure to bring a bag for trash if picnicking. I am getting tired of filling an entire garbage bag every time I visit.",1
Beautiful family park,1
Well,1
Nice place in the heart of the city center!,1
"best park in Montreal IMO.

Congratulations, however, on the beautiful snow removal effort (November 2019), especially for easier access to the casino for pedestrians who like to go through the gardens.

Angrignon Park (French: Parc Angrignon) is a large park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. Angrignon Park has a total area of 97 hectares.
The park is named for Jean-Baptiste Angrignon (1875-1948), a longtime city councillor in C√¥te Saint-Paul.
The park was inspired by the design of 19th-century English gardens. The park contains 20,000 trees, winding paths and a pond surrounded by cattails.
The park is located just south of Ville-√âmard, east of Carrefour Angrignon, which is also named after Jean-Baptiste Angrignon, and west of Verdun.
En 1944, on projette d'am√©nager un zoo d'importance dans le parc. Dix ans plus tard, la firme am√©ricaine d'architectes paysagers et ing√©nieurs McFadzean, Everly and Associates √©labore un programme complet. Le zoo serait dot√© de b√¢timents √† l'architecture symbolique inspir√©e des esp√®ces animales. Sur ce terrain de 250 acres (plus de 100 hectares soit plus d'un km2), agr√©ment√© d'une s√©rie de bassins, les animaux donneraient l'impression de circuler en libert√©. Bien qu'il ne soit r√©alis√© qu'en partie, le zoo accueille, chaque hiver, les animaux du Jardin des merveilles du Parc Lafontaine jusqu'en 1989, alors qu'ils sont d√©finitivement relocalis√©s au moment de la fermeture du Jardin des merveilles.",1

"A very nice place to happen upon while out for a walk in the area. Parc Saint-Gabriel has a pleasant feel. Walking through it does not seem as if some artificially human made destination, created just to add some green space in an otherwise residential and some commercial area. There are pieces of art type-esque additions that were added but are not intrusive, rather, they're complementary. The trees are the calming charm - old enough to be developed. There is a path that diagonally goes through the park which is convenient if headed to the nearby commercial destinations however the green space would be an enjoyable place to have a picnic, sit and read or throw around a frisbee. It's not especially large but does not feel cramped. Street parking.",1

Nice and relaxing to get some nature time in. Walk run or ski.,1
"This park is a gem in the West side on Montreal. Located at the edge of an industrial area, it guards a beautiful and peaceful forest great for running or just or hiking.  On its West side has a beautiful forest where you are sour rounded by big trees and maples while you are walking in a gravel path. On the East side is more open and if you are a train lover, you can see the local train pass very close to you several times a day. If you are a runner, you can easily do 8kms on their paths and maybe 10kms connecting all together. By the way, in winter it‚Äôs algo a good place to do cross-country ski, and also snowshoeing, specially with kids.",1

It is great to see so many people in the park enjoying all the beautiful attributes and surroundings the park has to offer.

"I really like this park, it's accessible in all seasons, cycling, walking, running and swimming during the summer, and yes, there's a beach here :) And skiing, snowshoeing or walking during winter. There's fees for parking your car here and for accessing the beach. Come early if you want to rent cross country skis, they tend to go fast when it just snowed. Also, the ski rental stops at 3PM, and closes at 4PM, so be mindful of the hours.",1
Beautiful place,0
"It's a beautiful park, lots of 300-year-old trees and there is even a toilet! Basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields etc etc has it all. There even left the fountain in vestige.

Very relaxing üòä,1
Nice park,1
"It is a great place if you just want to hang out with friends and spend the day relaxing. Bring your food and a blanket and just spend the time socializing with family and friends. Visually the park is okay. There is a lot of open grassy areas to sit down on but not much else. There's a man made lake in the middle but even that looks a bit gross. It is a green colour and I don't find that very appealing. There isn't that many trees but other than that, it's a good place to just spend the day outdoors.",1

"My favorite park in Montreal, although I was wish was bigger but that's only an issue in summer. So crowded on weekends",1
"A peaceful place where it is good to take some time for yourself. In both summer and winter, there is a host of activities on offer. Whether for jogging, cross-country skiing, wildlife viewing or just walking, the nature park is the perfect place to do it!",1
"Superb neighborhood park! Refurbished for 2 years. Unique basketball court and very well suited for children. With 4 different basket heights. Commestble plant landscaping. Only downside is the lack of shade in the central part. The City could have kept the magnificent existing crabapple trees and knitted their development around. Newly planted trees are very small and suffer greatly from abuse from their young clientele. If they are not better protected they will surely not be able to mature properly. Nevertheless, my children love to go there and can spend a lot of time there, because the activities are very diverse despite the limited space. Thank you Villeray for this beautiful work !!",1
Good place for cycling and just walking.,1

Super beautiful,1
"Not so much a park as a bike path with grass on one side and water on the other.

There are public restrooms, however, at the moment, they are closed.

Probably not the best place to walk - there are a lot of bikers whome are rather impolite.

Wheelchair accessible and parking (Free)",1
The dog park is often full and lacks services. It's hard to take your dog there.,0
"Beautiful park, however, no restrooms nearby,THE CITY should put some extra, as well at Mont Royal.",0
"The place is huge and currently a work in progress. An old quarry, garbage dump, with composting gives an area a particular sleek. Strange pods contain gas wells used to power Cirque du soleil and the Tohu I've told. Its a 6 km walk around, once you started there's no shortcut back. A big downside is a recycling plant on the South side. Winds blow paper and plastic trash all over giving you a true garbage dump experience. Along the west side you have Taz and an indoor soccer stadium. Its promising, cant wait to see what it will look like once finished.",0
Superb,1
"Proper space, play area in good condition and news. Security provided by lifeguard. Public piano.",1
"Went jogging this morning a bit before the sunrise. Only a half dozen of people were in the area. This park is amazing, there is a small lake at the top with boats to be rented, large picnic area and a small decent playground for children. I was impressed with the cleanness of the paths and the amazing view. I was luck and saw a real beaver walking around. Just beside you find a cemetery. If you like arts, there are some sculptures spread out in the park.",1

It is separated from the R-138 by a protective wall, below. You can go to Iles-de-Boucherville or continue to go to Boucherville. There are not many parking lots, but it is possible to find them if we exclude the free parking at Parc Marie-Victorin (where this portion of the track is pitiful). In Boucherville, you can park in the neighboring streets or in a small parking lot (vacant lot), right next to the track.",1

"This park is great. Its size surprised and fascinated me because looking in the distance it seems to extend towards the mountains (it is not, but it tickles the imagination). The current layout and especially the potential of the place are exceptional. The only inconvenience: the thickness of the layer of gravel in the tracks which, in certain places, unbalance the bike. We go back? A thousand times YES.",1

"Beautiful walking trails, that are well maintained even in the winter time. Bring on some good boots though! Easily accessible from downtown if you wanna power through a whole lotta steps.

The main chalet on top has some beautiful rooms, amenities and art pieces; the craftsmanship on it is great for a building that's as old as this. I had a great time just walking around it for a while. The bathrooms in there might be useful!

You can enjoy Beaver Lake, Maison Smith, the giant Cross on top of Mount Royal and of course the lookout right by Chalet Mont-Royal. The cemeteries nearby are also really beautiful and make for a nice afternoon or even as a day activity if you like nature and hiking!

Would recommend 11/10",1
