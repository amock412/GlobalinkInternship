"Beautiful Park with some great views! We went in the fall and the foliage was breathtaking. It was a gorgeous day so we weren't too hot or too cold. Definitely recommend doing even a short hike if you're visiting Montreal! We ended up being dropped off right near the viewpoint so our hike wasn't too long at all. You could do a steep long hike to the viewpoint, which I believe starts somewhere on Pike street.",1

"We went skating here on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
As we arrived, they were clearing the ice rinks, there are two, and the Zamboni cleaned the ice.
Good ice skating surface.  Would prefer if hockey sticks not allowed on one of the surfaces...there is a dedicated hockey rink but obviously insufficient for some ‚Äúenthusiasts‚Äù who spill over onto adjacent rink.
Gets real busy around 2-3pm...try going earlier...enjoy",1

"Beautiful park, but far too many shrubs have been cut! The park would benefit from having renaturalization sectors. The integral lawn, it dates from another time. The park is large, so natural environments could easily emerge. Stop cutting shrubs, it's strictly under the vision of safety that we do that! So that the police can go by car and see everything that happens in the park of the street, without moving, sitting in his car ... Sad time!",0
cool place summer and winter events e ery season,1
Very clean and well maintained,1
nature accessible even in town,1
Park in Ville St Laurent,1
"Run, cycle or simply walk on the predetermined paths of a park almost of the future in the heart of Montreal. A former quarry that became a landfill site and then turned into a park for the townspeople, it sometimes feels like you're in a science fiction movie. The memories of quarry and recent landscaping mix to give impeccable views everywhere on this vast land. The peace and serenity of being outdoors ensue. I liked it and will return it. You have to see it to believe it.",1

"Unique place in Quebec for sports and nature enthusiasts. There is an exceptional canopy there, one of the rarest and oldest in Quebec, in fact, the park has a collection of rare and also heritage trees, to be discovered in the Jardin des Floralies and on the island of Ste-H√©l√®ne. . Espace 67 is a project set up for event promoters who wanted to improve the offer of public shows in a strategic location in the park (especially large programs that can accommodate thousands of people). As a result, the place for sport and nature comes second in the priorities of the park. For about 15 years, the park's infrastructure has been falling apart, one thinks of the pavilions of Expo 67 established in a temporary perspective at the time which have not undergone any major renovation. We think of the Roseraie d'H√©l√®ne de Champlain along the Mcdonals road which has ruined tonelles which threatens to fall. The Korea Pavilion which is located near the bus stop, the Place des Nations (although mentioned in the 2021 Master Plan) as well as various locations clearly visible to visitors. The park has in its head a future more focused on the environment, mobility and awareness of biodiversity for the next decade. The catering offer is in the sights but it is always better to plan a lunch or a picnic before the trip. It's to do.",1

Nice park for children 2 sections for small and bigger Do not forget the first community fridge that is in the center of the park,1
One of Outremont's best small parks with great water features that make good use of the incline for little ponds and streams. Remember them fondly as a child spending time following the water down from the top to the pond at the bottom. Often used for wedding pictures.,1

I don't advise taking a swim in the artificial lake since it's notoriously very dirty, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal! Other than that, feel free to eat your lunch there, or go biking. For a more impressive parc, visit the Mont Royal, or even the Parc Maisonneuve.",1

"A wonderful journey into nature, right in the middle of our beautiful city !

Strolling through the numerous paths, enjoying the view, the astonishing greenery, the breeze, the peaceful silence mixed with families sounds and laughter, even hearing opera singers sharing their divine talent on a Sunday. It was/is all there, for our enjoyment, yet we often ignore these gifts, choosing social media or shopping malls. (not that there's anything terribly wrong with that...)
Angrignon Park is just a lovelier option, a moment to cherish, remember, and share. You will not regret the detour, plus it's free: bring a picnic basket, a banket to lie under the weeping willow by the water, and I promise that you will, just like we did, find yourself truly smiling, breathing again, grateful to be alive.
Someone is surely taking care of one of my new favorite spots: so THANK YOU to those City of Montreal workers!",1
Good for kids,1
I do not really remember this park ...,0
Very cute kiddies park.,1
"Very drinkable # 1 baseball / softball field, but far too many SMOKING CURSES around and in the stands, despite clearly displayed prohibition signs. Land # 2 is a disgrace to him. Even a camping league would give up on it. Fence (in hay spit ...) much too small and close to the game and platforms too. Dangerous even for the Atom caliber, which plays there (T√©traultville) ...",0
Very restful,1
"It's an Olmstead park, just like Central Park and Prospect Park in NYC.  I recommend going into one of the less traveled paths to feel like you are in a forest. Some of the paths have a a few stories worth of stairs so be prepared. Came here when on the hottest day or the year. There are not many water fountains so bring water if you are going to spend a lot of time was walking, which is ready to do.",1

Several activities take place throughout the summer season such as, among other shows and fireworks for St-Jean and Canada Day. NEW FOR SUMMER 2017 Brand new water play area finished installed !!! NEGATIVE POINT LAMENTALLY missing a picnic table. Access to toilets impossible, especially in early summer, when elsewhere they are open. At the start of the evening, the doors of the main building close to leave the many people still present with a single toilet accessible by another door on the side which gets out too early. When you know that several other parks still offer the possibility of relieving the bladder .... go to know why .....",1

"Certainly this park has no remarkable attraction, nor the reputation of a Laurier or Lafontaine park. Yet it exudes a special atmosphere in this Angus district in full revival.  The sunsets here are second to none in the heart of the city. The view is astonishingly clear in several directions: on Mont Royal, on the leaning tower, and the twilight brightness that exhales in the distance is surprising. We must take advantage of this before the construction boom completely obstructs visibility.  Services available: tennis, volleyball, p√©tanque, water games for children, large central plain for playing ball or frisbee.  As a bonus, the Angus market for local products which is held on Friday afternoons from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. from June to the end of October.",1

Beautiful park . Must when you visit in Montr√©al ‚úåÔ∏è,1
"Beautiful little place. Even in -15¬∞C, it is worth it.",1

The pool also has an adjoining kids sprinkler play area that also has a lifeguard. The swimming pool is heated but the kids area is not. The only downside is parking; there is no parking lot so you have to find something on the nearby streets.",1
"My comments are for the beach. The general location is good but the beach is not large. You can rent kayaks or paddle boards. The beach could be better maintained and cleaned. Be advised that there is no running water and the facilities are minimal. Good luck washing your hands if your child does # 2 and none of the chemical toilets have toilet paper. I notified the person, but the city is in charge, not the beach staff. At $ 10 for parking and $ 5 per adult, I expected much better.",0
"Sandy, often wet, crowded and LOTS of smokers, also, don't watch the fireworks there, the music is not in sync but delayed. And even though there's a non-smoking area, since it's an open space, smoke gets carried by the wind... and I wouldn't bring kids there because of the loud music also. Nice ambiance but not for everyone.",0
"Good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in some other places.

Good quality stuff!

"A park that should be a model to follow for future [re] developments of other parks; it is really the evolution of this type of commonplace that we find there!  There is something for every taste ; ""cross-fit"" facilities (physical training which only requires the weight of the person and solid surfaces and bars), the children's play facilities are of high quality, well thought out, modern and attractive.  The interest of my children having recently passed the age of the younger sections mentioned above, we took advantage of the multiple ""surfaces and obstacles"" (rock trails, plants and grasses, trees and shrubs) to - in our case - trying with pleasure and success our new remote-controlled car (that of the children :) and although there were several people in the park, the latter being relatively very large for a neighborhood park, it didn't bother anyone.  Everyone got their own: their mother was doing her exercises while we had fun and we noticed the installation of a ping-pong table and plan to meet there with rackets and balls! (Great! The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãping-pong tables)!  Twenty years ago and before, on the island of Montreal, there were only about Outremont and in certain privileged municipalities of the kind that one found such ‚Äúsuper-parks‚Äù. Today, it is a pleasure to see that the City of Montreal is finally making good use of the budgets made available to it.  At least in the Plateau Mont-Royal where yes, ‚Äútourists‚Äù (alias those who don't live there and frustrated motorists) can protest against the redevelopment of the neighborhood; For my part I find it great that finally real cycle paths are available in numbers to the point of being able to be described as part of a cycling NETWORK - versus the dangerous white paint lines of the Tremblay administration which was drawing a few million dollars each time 100 mothers of white lines had been spanned, thus scamming citizens and at the same time putting the lives of citizens in danger, the best example being the ‚Äú‚Äú cycle path ‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äùof boulevard Saint-Urbain: one of those famous white ""cycle"" lines which must have cost the lives of at least ten people ...  In conclusion: the ex-Mayor Fernandez whom so many people liked to criticize (and worse) is an example of what has been done well and what is wrong, the latter having to resign - out of integrity and respect for his own political values ‚Äã‚Äã- because he has clearly spent enough time in municipal politics to realize - at least I wish him - that he did more than anyone before him - and that unfortunately it will take a long time before Montreal can benefit of such a citizen welfare guard lieutenant.",1

It would be nice to renovate the toilets. Have more picnic tables especially by the river. And speaking of the river. We can no longer see it because all kinds of trees have invaded the banks. We would have to find a compromise in terms of trees and access to our majestic river and allow us to admire it. Just like the new footbridge has 14 million .... It is lower than the trees and we only saw on the 132 ....,0

To visit,1
"Small park where it is good to stop for a few moments to observe the wildlife of Saint-Laurent Boulevard. Also, on a windy day, you can take refuge there to read; unlike Parc Jeanne-Mance, the buildings can shelter us and protect us (a little!) against goose bumps. Bandstand where amateur musicians can spontaneously perform. Does it owe it to its name, this park is very gregarious, and several people gather there to exchange, in particular the elderly ... First generation Portuguese still living in the neighborhood?",1

Great place of green space that we still have despite all the development projects that never stop growing after we complain about climate change.

Family park for almost 15 years for us! ‚ù§,1
To have a good time in the summer.,0

Nice place!.. Small park and quiet.,1

Probably the best park in Montreal,1
"Nice facilities, lots of greenery, but it was very dirty the few times I went there.",1
I really like !,1
Nice fields,1
Beautiful square on the Plateau. To visit if you are visiting Montreal.,1
"First time to this park.  There are a lot of games that are suitable for ages 18 months to 5 years old.  However, there is no public toilet. They are children, not adults. Moreover, I understand that we are in a time of covid. On the other hand, that does not prevent children from being children. Adding tough restrictions won't help.  There are good tables with a lot of space, we were pleasantly surprised to see this.  The games are safe and my children love it.",1
Tennis court,1
Great outdoor venue and park.,1
"The place is well taken care of, but here the tourist needs attention, especially those, who like me, walk alone. I was followed by two people, nothing happened, because I went to a more crowded area and I was more attentive (I gave up because of the photos). There are many drug users of all kinds (see user profile of cracker, ethanol). Some stop you to ask for something. There is a very vulnerable population that needs attention from the city's social policies. Marijuana is legalized, so the square smells of marijuana, lots of people using it. There is a harmony between vulnerable users and recreational users, at this point I did not see anything disturbing.",1
Beautiful,1
This place offers an island of nature in an ocean of concrete. Very appreciable especially during lockdown,1
Beautiful place,1
I really like walking in this park. Nice view of the river. Well-groomed trails.,1
Very nice park on the river. It is possible to practice several activities for all ages,1
Big beautiful park.  There are plenty of hiking paths leading to scenic views of Montreal.   You can also drive and ride your bike throughout the park.  There is also a city transit bus that has pickup and drop-off spots throughout.    There is also a rest area with restrooms near the lake.  The lake is small but cute and is filled with gold fish.   There is plenty of picnic areas throughout the park as well.   The park is big but walkable.   There is a water fountain in the rest area but I'd recommend if hiking the park to bring water.   Plenty if fields for the dogs and kids to play .,1

Beautiful park for children,1
"Parc Judith-Jasmin is a charming neighborhood public space that impresses with its beauty. There are three rocks that are placed in such a way as to convey the mystique of a Zen garden. If you are walking by or if you just need to relax, make sure to visit and relax on oen of its benches.",1

Really a great idea!",1
An incomparable calm better place to relax,1
The park has a separated playground area for kids 18MO - 5 yrs old and another one for kids 5 to 12. The skilled playground for the big kids (with a lot of rope climbing) is specially challenging and fun üòä,1

"It is a great place if you just want to hang out with friends and spend the day relaxing. Bring your food and a blanket and just spend the time socializing with family and friends. Visually the park is okay. There is a lot of open grassy areas to sit down on but not much else. There's a man made lake in the middle but even that looks a bit gross. It is a green colour and I don't find that very appealing. There isn't that many trees but other than that, it's a good place to just spend the day outdoors.",1

"All perfectly . there are chess tables, a basketball court, a swing for different ages, etc.",1

"As far as parks go, it's okay. Not much for kids to do, not much space to play, located by the tracks and lachine's industrial district.

This would function a lot better as a dog park in my personal opinion but I doubt we'd ever see that again. Here's hoping the change will eventually get made",0

"If there is a paradise in Montreal, it‚Äôs here and it‚Äôs now. Get up there!!!",1

A nice little park which has been under restoration since May. It is the children who are penalized. How come that pocket-sized games take so long to be handed out to their users?,0
"C'est le parc de mon enfance/adolescence. Aujourd'hui, j'y am√®ne mon fils de 3 ans. Il s'y amuse comme un petit fou. Il y a toujours pas mal d'enfants les soirs de semaine et les fins de semaine. C'est un parc o√π r√®gne la gaiet√©. La seule chose qui serait un bonus dans ce parc, c'est s'ils ajoutaient des jeux d'eau. Alors l√†, l'exp√©rience serait parfaite pour les tout-petits.",1

"Another of LaSalle's parks in need of a little attention. Impact/landing zones are below grade for CSA standards. Anyone can fact check that little nugget of knowledge by the way, just research it. The equipments been updated over the years so that's nice at least. And this park is wonderfully located near a busy street, and yet still is a nice quiet park. Definitely a park worth taking younger kids too. For the record though, there's not a lot in the nearby area, so if you want to take your kids for ice cream or a treat afterwards, your options are a nearby depanneur, Marash (from what I understand, worth the visit) or hop in a car and go to Place LaSalle.",0

Def recommend for a breather.",1

"Great Park, feels like far away in the wilderness yet only 5 minutes drive from the Metro and a WOW view of Montreal and the St-Laurence River. I visit this park frequently one of my favorite places I noticed over the years that wildlife is becoming more abundant than ever, just last year I notice lynx tracks +  cub tracks along side of the river in the mud, the the feline paws were so larg that I thought it was the Eastern Puma making √† new come-back but still unsure about that last one, also there are sightings coyotes. There is lots of deer throughout the near by parks of the St-Laurence River. Just hope they will protect one of so many last areas like Park Marie-Victorin

Pictures of the new Normandie passerelle just before the 21h30 curfew, they have a 24h parking at the entrance of the Normandie bridge (passerelle) from Bord de l'eau street very super nice, it will lead you right into  Marie-Victorin park.

This bridge is about a year or so old replacing an older one that was really basic until in February of 2015 it got struck by a dumpster truck coming from the highway with his dumpster still up and destroying it on one side of the highway.",1

The children's section is really big and the play modules are impressive: chimes to play music with a mallet, water and sand basins to create waterfalls and dams, swings of all kinds and I pass. The proximity to Mount Royal and the traditional tam-tams make it a destination of choice for the whole family.",1

A super beautiful park to spend a day with the family. Ideal for spending the day with friends and practicing water sports. There is a charge for parking for the day.

"Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Park is a pretty, green park with lots of trees and lots of shade. Unfortunately the park is often full as soon as there is a little sun in the evenings and weekends. It gets very noisy. The park has a lot of infrastructure (children's play, neighborhood swimming pool, baseball field, soccer field, p√©tanque ...) I regularly go to the dog park which is clean and functional. I wish there were a little more trees and grass in this place because when the sun is present it is very hot and the animals suffer a bit. If you want to play with your animal with a toy, I do not recommend this dog park because there are very regular people in this park who do not like it and who will tell you to stop even if the cohabitation between the dogs is good. I go there regularly but it's not my favorite dog park in Montreal.",0

"This place is awesome!  As you can see I was here in the winter.  So many great walking trails, great view over the city near the summit.  Lots of people use this, skiing, mountain bike riding, joggers, walkers, sledding, such a great place.  Despite the snow, trails are well maintained.  Very safe to walk around... I went up here at 3am one morning (couldn't sleep jet lag), I did take a torch but didn't need it as the lights from McGill University and the hospital shone up this way, so was able to see the trail no problems.  Near the top there is some more lights (where communication tower is) and against the white snow I didn‚Äôt need my torch.  Not sure how it goes during summer.  I went up this hill many times during my stay,  ice skating rink, the stone art, the cross at top, plus the awesome view of the city, so many things in this area so close to the city.  Need to take care if you going up the stairs, very icy, very steep, I preferred to go via the wide trail that winds its way up the hill, as much as the stairs are a great heart burner and good for getting heart rate up, too slippery and had a close call, so the slow burn up the trail incline was for me.  Well worth the effort.",1

Just drove through. Looks really nice,1
"First and foremost, the oversized chairs! Undeniably fun for all ages to snap a picture beside or climbing up to 'site's down.
Dispite being alongside two main artery for driving in the area, the park feels like a mini (midsized) oasis all year round. There's no intrusive sense of surrounding cars both audibly and visually.
There is always parking, which is a huge plus. Public transit seems easy enough, a bus stop at the far corner behind the building next to the park.
Lots of trees and greenery/bushes throughout the place, most notably the tall trees surrounding the place.
Adult and kid friendly with curious artwork and walking winding walking paths on one end and a playground at the far end for kids (and parents!).
The contrast of open areas, nooks of interest along the trails and once again the placement of trees and plantlife make for a lovely destination for some 'outdoorsy' time right amidst the city.",1

It's incredible, it's like being on the west coast with all these concrete modules and the very intuitive configuration, which leaves room for the imagination of any skateboarder at any level.

It's 9$ to park for more than 2hours, unless you know another entrance from accross the park, then you can park on the residential streets. We appreciated the Japanese walkway and how well covered the biggest part of the park was. Some small  educational part of the park also seems to still be working. Takes about 3 hours do do the entire park, and will do it again one day soon!",1

"This is a very nice park, without much furniture: only the odd bench or picnic table. It is flat and wide, and has some nice but sparse trees. It is crisscrossed by many foot paths, and is traversed by the Lachine canal bicycle path. Dogs are allowed on a leash, but not only during the daytime. It‚Äôs a wide part of the otherwise narrow public lakefront strip that spans almost all of the burrow of Lachine‚Äôs lakefront. This strip exists thanks to the old city of Lachine that had a policy to return the banks of lac St-Louis to the citizens.  There is a war memorial statue, dedicated ‚ÄúTo our Soldier‚Äù at the top end. This 1925 piece by Alfred Lalibert√© was recently moved here by the burrow of Lachine, which is somewhat fitting considering that during the first world war, this park was used as a depot for military horses in transit to the European battlefields.",1
Beautiful park! It's good if you want to relax.,0

Also pickleball and basketball courts are not maintained, the grounds tend to accumulate a lot of sand and dirt, they should really clean up the concrete play areas, and remove the sand/dirt, because it makes the grounds more slippy, and when playing with a ball the sand / dirt adheres to the ball - My children play basketball there and come back with black hands because their ball accumulates mud and dust as the courts are really in bad shape.   Please use our damn tax dollars to clean the play areas once in a while.",0

"The view from the ""mountain"" is spectacular. I'm from Utah and live in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, so a 600+ foot peak is more of a hill than a mountain. That being said, it's worth the trip.  You have to pass through the cemetery to get to the top, but it's one of those old, interesting cemeteries that invites you to read the headstones as you pass.

Once on top you can see nearly all of Montreal and the river. There's also an old art gallery with a gift shop and some paintings still there although most have been removed. For me it was a place to warm up after a cold walk.

Take the trip to the top, you won't be disappointed.",1

It offers visitors to immerse them in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgreenery teeming with birds, squirrels and mushrooms. The park is well maintained and its trails offer many possibilities for walking or cycling. There are several entrances to the park, including the following: 1- at the end of rue Douglas B. Floreani, in Saint-Laurent (where there is a parking lot and a reception chalet) and 2-next to boulevard Sunnybrooke in Dollard-des-Ormeaux. Without forgetting these other accesses: on Basswood and C√©r√®s streets, in Pierrefonds; on Gouin Ouest, before Highway 13 (there is a parking lot and another chalet) and at the end of rue Du Ruisseau, in Saraguay. I recommend visiting this area if you want to stop to observe turtles!",1

The pavilion is run on weekdays by a hardworking lady who is always very caring and very professional. There are large tennis courts, children's practice soccer fields, ping-pong table on Boulevard Robert's side, near the basketball court. The winter ice rink (hockey) is very busy. There are exercisers left by the city so that citizens can keep fit!",1
Always cool!,1
Good place to walk.,1
"Beautiful beach, it‚Äôs like a well kept secret on the island. Sandy beach, pleasant, with surveillance (sometimes a little intense because of all the rules to follow), Max depth 1m 60 but you get there slowly so it's ideal for families, picnic area, barbecue, rental of 'equipment (canoe, etc.). Begins to be less secret; we are hot in summer, there are a lot of people :-( victim of its success .. but I recommend without hesitation",1

There's a water fountain near the bus stop along Sherbrooke O.

Two soccer fields, two playgrounds, a splashpad and a gymnasium that often doubles as a polling station.

In the winter, there's an outdoor ice rink.",1

BUT

It has a stunning view, beautiful waterfront picnic spots, picnic tables, and you can park right close to your spot.

Sunsets and fishing are common attractions almost everyday. People will either fish or sit romantically enjoying the setting sun.

The park joins with a series of paths that lead all around the island. It's truly a stellar place to run, bike, or meander.",1
"Water games and play modules for children in summer, softball and soccer field, winter arena, multifunction room and toilets accessible during park opening hours.",1
Lovely place to spend the afternoon,1
Very nice park with water games,1
"This pinpointed location on Google Maps is by the Mont Royal parking lot. If you're here for the observation deck to enjoy panoramic views of downtown Montreal AND are arriving by car, definitely drive to this location. The observation deck is another 800 meters from here, and can only be reached by foot. Because this location sits at a higher elevation, the hike shouldn't be too daunting. My 55-year old aunt did just fine.

Of course, there are other ways to reach the observation deck, but all of them require some hiking. If you're downtown, you can start hiking at the foothills along Pine Ave or Cedar Ave. That hike is more uphill and might be daunting for some.

Wear comfortable walking shoes, bring water and provisions, and enjoy the view! There are visitor amenities at the observation deck, including restrooms, a gift shop, and a small cafe.",1
Very lovely. During the sunset it can definitely get crowded but totally worth it.,1
In love with this park...its near my place so I am always walking around there or just hanging around soaking in the sun in the summer.,1

Yes small but clean with public toilets (with children it is practical),1

So beautiful,1
Children's games and picnic tables,1
"The water games are so unknown that we spent many summer days there without crowds. Yet they are great, there are tables and benches under a roof which gives us shade, access to chemical toilets not used. You just have to find the post in front of the tables and have a very steep trip. People don't see them because they are just jets coming out of the ground. To discover while keeping the place a secret.",1
Lovely view!,1
Absolutely amazing.  So many things to do.  Great for everyone!,1

"The Bois de Jubilation is a great place for a family walk! I recommend the black maple trail which, in my opinion, is nicer than on the side of the Japanese footbridge. It should also be mentioned that some sections are closed for redevelopment, but I also saw several trails closed for no apparent reason. All in all, a natural wood to visit on the island of Montreal.",1
"A nice big green space out of alignment with the city. A tad difficult to access but worth the trip. Activities that can be practiced are tennis, basketball, baseball, soccer and even kite flying. However, they lack toilets and few restaurants are nearby.",1

Very nice place to visit. But be very careful of the parking spot. There is a big Stone right infront of the parking machine. And I had a vig scratch in my car beacuse of these. This is such a irresponsibility of the parking authority.  Please guys be careful of this stupid stone.,0

Love this gem of nature nicely tucked on our island. It's a bit hidden away and that's what makes it great. It's quiet and not overly crowded. Walks are decently long and most of the time you forget that you are in Montr√©al.,1
It is a beautiful park ... Unfortunately there is the proximity of a large volume of traffic that causes visual pollution and it also makes bike paths much less safe.,0

People who live in the town or don't have that long to drive use Turtle Wharf Park regularly, be it for walks along the river, bike rides along its very long and very spacious bicycle paths, as a picnic site with the family, for its petanque courts,  or simply as a place to relax and watch the world go by.",1

One of my favorite walks on the way to the Champlain Bridge estacade,1
"5 stars for how close you can sit by the water and the amazing waves of water on the south side. There is a significant variety of nooks to stop and sit or simply take in the many panoramic views along the peninsula. The walkway, starting a short distance from the adjacent bike path towards the water begins with a calm lake on the right (west side) and then marsh-like scenery to the left once you start heading towards the peninsula.",1

"Great Park, Close to Montreal, Close to the City.
Reasons to go:
1. The Variety of Birds, Turtles and Wildlife
2. Nice Swamps, Nice Ponds

Yet the park can take you less than 2:30 hours to do almost all the routes, also parts of the park are close to the main road, and you can hear cars a lot. Also parts of the park are not well maintained, the bridges where down and dangerous when I went there.

But all in all worth a one time visit, I did it walking, yet biking seems to also be a fun option.",1

In the summer there are also various performances (such as dance shows, theatre, movies) several times a week, free of charge. There are tennis courts, p√©tanque play areas, beach volleyball, a soccer field, a baseball field, and even an enclosed dog park. There‚Äôs also a large field to play whichever sport you want (in front of the dog park, probably need to book it unless no one is using it) and plenty of space to play outdoor games or make bbq, though it can get crowded despite how large the park is. And of course there‚Äôs a large pond with a fountain and ducks. You don‚Äôt even need to come with food ‚Äî there‚Äôs Ma Poule Mouill√©e and La Banquise right next to it and a d√©panneur to buy drinks. Pretty much everything you would ever want from a park.",1

"There is a community garden with 200 plots, tennis courts, a baseball diamond, an astroturf soccer field, skateboard ramps, a skating rink in the arena and outside during the winter. There's a fair bit of garbage that gets mowed instead of picked up, the swings need painting, and dog owners let their dogs off the leash to terrorize joggers, and we could do with an exercise area for adults...but it's still pretty great park.",1
So a nice place for children and family! Love this.place,1
"Parc Saint-Jacques is an outdoor location near the west of the city of Montreal. We go there for cross country skiing. The tracks are drawn mechanically. Our comment relates to the layout of the cross-country ski trails. These tracks follow the layout of the exploitation of the agricultural territory on which the park is established. At the junction of the plots of land, these agricultural paths turn at right angles that the cross-country ski trails follow scrupulously which requires the skier to follow these tracks at a right angle. The practice of cross-country skiing prefers a more harmonious course contrary to these right angles which impose a break in the rhythm of the alternative step that all practice. These angles therefore require engaging in these angles incompatible with the practice of an alternative ski step. It would not be difficult to correct these routes to optimize the cross-country ski trails. Why is it not done? It would not be difficult to correct these routes to make them better trails, better designed and more compatible with cross-country skiing. A second comment: where the tracks must cross the roads, the Park administrators should put snow to cover the asphalt ... curious about a cross-country ski center requires skiers to remove their skis in the middle of the course. As if the park administration did not know the attributes of cross-country skiing. Let's see what the Park will respond to my comment.",0
Nice place,1
It has soccer fields that are being used by NDG soccer. You can register your kids at ndg soccer in March/April for playing and practicing soccer. Also there is a nice playground and water play area.

"It's a great dog park. Finally something useful for the tax dollars!

However, a couple of caveats:
- If you go there late, lights won't turn on until it's been dark for an hour or so. They'll be on during the night, though.
- There's always a bad apple or two, even among the dog owners. You'll always have to look after your dog or he/she will get bitten, humped or both.
- Not all of the owners pick up after their dogs (one even angrily yelled at me that dog excrements belong in the dog park, he's not the one to disturb natural order of things), so better look at your feet while you're walking around!
- The park has no different sections for different sized dogs, which just means you'll have to be even more careful if your dog is tiny.

Anyway, overall it's a great park with a great community. Almost all of the regulars are decent people with nice and well-behaved dogs.",1

Youth can gather there to play a game , soccer or whatever that fit their mood.

"It's huge as it's spread on both sides of the road. The biggest negative I find is that there is a lot of noise and people do a lot of drugs there (although I still felt safe with my kid). There is a swimming pool (sorta), lots of options for kids of all ages (the most I have ever seen in any park). It is also very convenient located, as it's closer to a metro station and bus stops. You can go to the top of the mountain from here.",1

The best attractions in my opinion are those that successfully combine nature(outdoors) and modern fun, and this one more that fits the bill.

LA (because there is only one) cross-country ski trail is at most 4km and not 11km so the information on the site is false.

Go elsewhere if you want to have fun cross-country skiing and not have to constantly pass people.,0

I hit the road all the way to get there, paid the parking lot and the beach entrance ($$), to make me say that, while I was going for a long kayak trip. What a desappointment! In addition, they rent boats at great prices, to turn in circles in a small bay that crosses the swimming. You can kayak in your own pool ...

Even in the forest, the suburbs are never far away. We had to cross a road to continue on the trail and the priority to pedestrians and cyclist is not respected. In short this park is not worth the detour for these activities.",0

"*** This review is only for the dog park ***
There is a dog park on the corner Poirier and Decarie.  I previously thought that this one is so-so, but after moving to West Island realised that this one is actually good.  First, it's spacious.  Second, it's grassy, so you can walk even after rain and won't mix mud.  Third, there are free poopy bags - I think it's nice, since people may forget to bring their own sometime.
There are 2 big picnic tables - not that you're going there for a picnic, but it shows that the city has provided, not the dog owners bringing their own.
Sometime when I drive by and my dog is with me, we stop there for a while.",1

This is a really nice neighborhood park. it is large and has a lot of place to sit or to play a game. They have a baseball field that host a couple of friendly matches. It is a great place to bring your kids since here is some playground for them. It is also a nice place to go for a picnic with friends.

The little homeland ca is worth the detour as much as the plateau,1

Their parents must be smokers as likely. In addition that education is free in Quebec .. bizzard ...",1
Don' be visit christmas season,0
Absolute beauty and peaceful surroundings.  Sunset is the most spectacular time of the day because the reflections off the water in addition to the ducks and Canada geese gracefully gliding and flying add to the tranquility this location has to offer.,1
The local vegetables and artisanal products are really great!,1
I really like,1
"Nothing against park wardens, they do a great job. However, they should work for the city instead of the private one. It seems to me that it would really optimize the quality. By separating and structuring with the work of city employees. The bocce fields, the lines of the soccer fields and baseball are tough. Before the other boroughs had to take notes of how we were doing !!!",0
Superb place in town. The city campaign.,1
"During winter time, there has a nice snow ramp. It's perfect for snowboarding! For kids!",1
"Great place to play volleyball! Very clean, nice park.",1

I didn't say anything even though I was mad....so I'm playing with my kids and was approached again by a male lifeguard at that point I got mad...started saying look around...I'm the only person with a bathing suit! My burkini is clearly a bathing suit made of Lycra....it's unbelievable how racist people can be..I live in the Plateau....stupidity has no limit...will not go back.",0

"Where: Vauquelin Place, Montreal
What: A square with fountains just beside City hall
How was it: It's a nice place to check out while you are heading towards the Old Port.  It's especially nice if you are coming from Champ de Mars and you climb up the stairs.
Sadly this year there are huge renovations and you cannot go through.  It was nice before and it will be again...

"Walking, running, biking, picnic and bbq, play sports, walk and run with your pets, it can all be done in this incredibly big park filled with nice spots to enjoy some quiet time or interact with other people. Whatever you enjoy you can do in this park. On average I have never seen this park completely full or packed unless it was a festival. If you search well enough you might just get lucky and find yourself a spot to make you forget you are in the city. ENJOY!!!",1

A new park for children and adults.,1

Very welcoming park for both children and adults despite its small size.  A small flat: we could not put a button to activate the water for a certain period rather than wasting it during the long day when there is no one? : /,1

It's good,1
"Beautiful park with beautiful modules and beautiful water games. Young woman working for the city with a first aid kit, very practical for minor ailments in children.",1
Some really old trees are in this park.,1
"It is a beautiful and relaxing park with  a recently renovated dog park, a small water park and a playground for kids, which are now open. Sometimes atmosphere feels like Woodstock. Before the freak microbursting  windstorm of August 22nd, 2017, there were lots of old trees but they did do a nice job making the park beautiful again. Having a play in the park was a good idea, and has become a pleasant but distant memory of the old days. Considering many people in this neighborhood don't have backyards or balconies, going to a park is crucial for their well being, especially when so much has been stopped and may not restart as expected or promised. One thing missing in this park is an official skateboard area/rink so there is a lot of random skateboarding going on sometimes even on the cenotaph and obstructing the walking area around the cenotaph. Sometimes the distancing rules are not remembered and some boarders wiz by other park goers within inches so there is a potential for a future accident waiting to happen, IMO. You also have to keep an eye on the path when walking because, like most of Montreal there are a lot of  pot holes, skateboarders whizzing by and people who stand in the path talking to each other 6 feet apart  so you have to walk around them. Sometimes not much respect for social distancing and a small number of  frisbee throwers, not  wearing masks, tend to be inconsiderate of others sitting on benches, while apologizing every time they almost hit them with a possibly contaminated frisbee, sometimes crawling under the bench the person is sitting on to retrieve the possibly contaminated frisbee, so only safe option is to find another bench. Similar with taking a bus nearby. An unmasked person putting their hands on the back of your seat  gives you  no other safe option but to find another seat, cause someone saying that they are sorry while they are possibly spreading, instead of trying to prevent the spreading and the fear of spreading Covid-19 to possibly vulnerable people is not enough IMO & rather stupid if not hypocritical. We have gone through all this for 3 months, putting millions out of work & many businesses could go bankrupt, to prevent spread of Covid-19, so an umasked stranger can whimsically throw a possibly contaminated frisbee so another can  crawl under your bench to retrieve it. For a moment a beautiful park feels like a sad place to be.",1
"It was written that us a perfect place for bbq. But as a first visitor, I found it a mess. It was a bbq every where as well as interdiction sign. Very confused and unsatisfy.",0

"Nice park, space for small kids, bigger, tennis courts, basketball, sprinkles and pool. Bathrooms are an issue though when the tennis court one is closed...or the pool.",1
Nice and breezy,1
"Really nice parc. It has a section for kids, a section for water games and a huge and clean soccer field for practices and games. At night the lights turn on and you feel like you are in a completely different place. The soccer field is made of synthetic grass which means that shoes with cleats are strongly recommended if you don't want to slip and embarrass yourself in front of everyone. I would definitely go back there and play with friends or family.",1
Most of the trails are closed or inaccessible currently.,1
"I really enjoyed the ambiance of this park. A crowd of young people having fun and it is important to say, in this time of pandemic, everyone was following the instructions of the government. We had a BBQ to celebrate a friend's birthday. Excellent.",1

"I don't know the history of this park or the reason it was built. But it has the feeling of a park created by politicians to get a story in the newspaper about the city creating more parks.

It's only the size of a single or double lot, half of it is covered in poorly maintained stone (which is surprising how close it is to the public works yard down the road), a handful of benches and a small strip of grass. It's right beside a busy road and rather inhospitable. And the fact it's only a block away from a real park, it just doesn't make sense why anyone decided to build this park in the first place. Popular with homeless guys though.",0

"English / French; Google asking me oh was that place .. I thought they were keeping a closer look at us then this. Since during summer time I passed there 2-3 times a week. But this week-end will be the blossom of the Lila 'hallway 8 feet tall on both side of the bike ride just Lila at there peak. I am not trusting the information about what they say about the animal we found in those wood since already in 2011 200% of the birds in the world had died, make the math and call the nwo, example ecerything that got 3 ""6"" in there loge like googlr for insteance, they would be better for a coherent answer to that strange news. Or Start by the city, they showed us 4 times of flower that are no where to be found but here we read that as we are smeeling the nature in lila form. Go figure it out. Again those information are for people thay can she but are blind. But dispute the totalitarianism that even reach nature information on bike trail this place will make you forget the regret you all secretly keep inside about having your shot of the ""vacine"". So go out, if your scare bright it with you .. You will be set fre for the time of a walk.  English French ; Google ask me oh how was this place .. I thought they were taking a closer look at us. All summer I went there 2-3 times a week. But this weekend will be the peak of the 8ft high Lila Corridor budding on both sides of the bike ride. I am disappointed by the signs that rely on the information on what they say about the animals that we should find in these woods since already in 2011 200% of the birds in the world were dead, do the math and call the nwo, for example any what a mega company that have 3 ""6"" in their logo like google for example, they would be the best place for a consistent response to this strange news. Or Start with the city, they showed us 4 times of flowers that are nowhere to be found but surrounded by lilac no comment on this plant. Go find out. Again, this information is intended for people who can; see, but who are blind. But to challenge totalitarianism which even accesses information about nature on cycle paths, we perhaps deserve the loss of our rights and their grandiose display of domination over us the people. Regardless, this place will make you forget the regret that you all keep secretly inside of you for having had your dose of the ""vacin"". So go out, if you're afraid to go out, bring it with you. You will be free for a walk.",1

"Very nice park to meet with family or friends. Practically this park represents an extension of the residences and condominiums which surround this place. Several arches (street furniture) are installed there so that you can hang your personal hammock on it. (Many visitors already consider them as personal property and reserve them by hanging up their goods early ... Too bad ...) A beautiful small central fountain adds a lot of charm and some large century-old maple trees bring a shaded light very appreciated during the days of bright sun ... In short, everything is there to please and enjoy lazy days or evenings as we all like to do. Good to hear.",1

"Other than Mont-Royal, best urban park on the Island of Montreal for all kind of summer and winter activities. Large and expansive, you will soon forget that you are in a major city. Best place to learn cross-country ski and try out snowshoeing. Sure, there is also Cap-St-Jacques but it is a little too out of the way and tucked in the Northwest corner of the island. This one is smack in the western middle.",1

For the : The recent chalet that simplifies things Dynamic administration of activities  The cons: The dog enclosure which completely disfigured the northern part",0

"Have gone here for years to celebrate family birthdays. This year there has been a severe decrease in park cleanliness, specifically overflowing garbage bins and bathrooms out of service, porta-potties full to the max and not clean. There is also a severe red ant infestation (beyond the normal amount of ants you expect in a park). Parking has historically been inadequate as well.

On the plus side, it has 2 well maintained soccer fields on the maisonneuve side of the park, a wide-open grassy patch for sunning, yoga, or frisbee, and a small play area with slides and water games for kids.

Beautiful nature,1
"This park is the first one I visited when I arrived in Montreal 33 years ago.  It went through a lot of good and bad times, nice and not so nice crowds but the spirit is still there.  It is a great place to hangout, to relax, to play many different sports with friends or simply sit down and enjoy a book or the scenery.  Ponds and waterfalls have been restore, fountains have multicolor LEDs, ducks can chase colored toe nails (just kidding).  It can sometimes be a bit like Woodstock since covid19 outbreak but hey, I don't know anyone complaining about that but the police.  LaFontaine Park is an oasis when heatwaves hit Montreal and everyone would miss it if disappeared.  That's it!  Now go.",1

I went there last Christmas, and when I went up there, I remember a little raccoon going through the trash can for food, But there was a warning sign on the parking area that said no feed raccoons, so we didn't feed it, we just watched it. and my friend said that on summer nights, raccoons would come out for food or a walk and she told me that every night the Jews from the church would come here to see the scenery and have a chat.

Great for sports,1
Nice bike path.,1
"The notice concerns the Ile-des-Soeurs cycle path  I have been a resident of the Island for 35 years. At the beginning, the cycle path which goes around the island was pleasant. It has never been maintained, which means that, today, the track is disgusting, particularly along the Parc de l'Or√©e-du-Fleuve. The track is crevassed in multiple places or overgrown with vegetation, which makes it almost dangerous. Several cyclists have also chosen to ride on Boulevard de l'Ile-des-Soeurs instead of using the parallel tracks. As the residents of Ile-des-Soeurs provide more than 60% of the taxes of the Verdun borough, one wonders what its mayor, member of the Executive Committee of Montreal, is waiting for to give back to the island of bicycle paths. ..... easily cyclable !!!!",0
Quiet park,1
Beautiful place,1
"Has a pool and is usually pretty crowded. Lately the cops have been cracking down on alcohol consumption without meals, so if you are looking to continue drinking beers after you picnic ends, you may be best heading to a different park.

The park also closes at 11 or 12, and this is pretty strictly enforced (ie. cop cars literally driving through the park). An ok park but not one of my favourites.",0

The park is divided into two sections separated by Henri-Bourassa Blvd. The first section has basketball and tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, indoor ice-skating arena, outdoor swimming pool and a small skating park. In January 2021, a pond has frozen forming an outdoor ice skating field. The second and smaller section has a track for walking and relaxing. Both sections have a playground for small children, benches and areas for picnic.",1

"This park is so large!!!  Soccer fields for different ages, a baseball field/pitch? Lots of light when it gets darker and friendly staff who set up fields and take them down.",1
"Yes this is a big park with lots of space to let your dogs run around. However this dog park needs to be better organized or regulated. Dog owners come and leave their dogs to run around without any oversight. We saw 15-20 dogs running around and only 5-6 people in the park. There needs to be a small dog sectioned off area. Our small puppy got attacked by an aggressive German Shepard who kept trampling on him and biting him. Thank god I was right near my pup and was able to wrestle him away after a few minutes.

When we yelled whose german Shepard this was, No one would claim him. Someone told us it belongs to an old guy but he was nowhere in the park.

Long story short- big park but beware of irresponsible dog owners with aggressive dogs because it is an off leash park.",0

"Great small park with lots of activities for kids of any age. Great waterfall area where kids can play, rope activities to climb, good water fountains area and LOTS of tables and benches! Must visit with kids if nearby!",1
"A part is in complete repair and transformation, therefore inaccessible for the moment. If, when finished, it's like on the map then that should be fine for a large city park. But strangely, several concrete structures will remain in place leaving much less space for the greenery so lacking in the city. Unfortunately, the park is crossed by 3 cross streets and is surrounded by 2 boulevards, which makes 3 small noisy parks. Eventually the other two parts will be renovated in the hope that they will no longer be isolated by walls which make the spaces worrying for users. Ideally, I would like to eliminate the cross streets to link the 3 parts and make a single more user-friendly park.",0
A wonderful family place for children and adults,1
"Superb park. Victim of their success, children's play modules are always crowded. Adding one more would not be too much. The skating rink is quiet, but lacks a suitable space to put on and take off the skates ...",1

"Nice place, always busy when it's nice out though!",1
The best dog park district,1
"The park is well worth a visit, has an abundance of natural beauty, some of which are truly breathtaking. The amenities are pretty organized and well thought out. But if you're planning to visit the place with family, by all means avoid going there on the weekends. No matter what time of the day you choose on a weekend, you'll find the park cramped with visitors, which is certainly not something you want to see in a nature park. And if you're driving, lo and behold! You'll find yourself playing some sort of a musical chair game with other drivers in the parking area. Not to mention that the parking is ridiculously expensive.",1
During the summer always nice activities to do,1
Very beautiful and large PArc,1

You're sick,1
I love this park!!,1

too much mosquito today but it is a very beautiful park,1
"Large park for the neighborhood. Early in the morning you can see the fog or the sun seeping through the trees, it's really beautiful !! In the summer, there are some events such as outdoor music or family activities. It is sorely lacking plants and flowers. In summer, the pool and the events take a lot of parking around, it becomes difficult for residents who need a vehicle to park, it bothers. I think there is a bad urban planning and lack of revitalization. The park is very clean but regular monitoring should be done for large branches that fall to the ground.",0

"Good place for soccer players, convenient parking place",1
Good area. Nice for walks or a bike ride. In the evening people tend to get drunk down by the river lol.,1
"I always make it a point to come here everytime I visit Montreal. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, and see it from a comfortable distance. Being the site of the World Expo in 1967, you'll see remnants of that event as you walk around, including Alexander Calder's towering art installation called ""Trois disques"" and the Biospehere geodesic dome. The park is served by a metro station (yellow line), convenient for those reliant on public transportation to move around the city.

For our most recent trip, we skipped the top attractions and just did some light hiking. From the metro station, we headed toward the ""Trois disques"" and enjoyed the scenic views of downtown Montreal. From there, we followed a tree-covered walk path toward the southern tip of the island, and then made our way back to the metro station. 1.5 hours in total.

We were tempted to rent those Bixi bikes near the metro station and bike it to downtown, but the fierce winds deterred us. There aren't a lot of food places around here so be sure to bring some with you if you're planning to be here for a few hours.",1

There is nothing wrong with that, try to be generous, even if you know they will spend it on the wrong thing try not to judge or be upset when they ask. It is truly very hard to be hooked on a substance especially when these people are in constant despair...something to tink about. Not recomend to hang there at night alone.",1
Ideal for families friends etc. Many resources,1
Very nice quiet park,1
"You have to pay for the parking there. Its a calm place near the stressfull area of downtown.
You can allways count on finding a parking there. But if you have a metro card, come with bus.

"My wife and I particularly liked this place. This is a very beautiful trail that runs along the edge of the Rivi√®re des Prairies in Montreal North. As you can even see the photos that I have published, You can admire not only the wonderful ducks but also a nice glimpse of the trail which stretches for several kilometers. During my walk with my better half, a ü¶ã even arises on my forearm for a few minutes. However, you can even have a picnic along the course because there are tables there for this purpose. There are even benches at certain places on the path to sit down to rest a bit. Do not be satisfied with my comment because I may be preaching for my parish as the saying goes. So go and enjoy a beautiful day of sun and a magical landscape",1
"Large play area, overall very nice. Too bad it is sorely lacking in shade and trees. And above all a pity for the huge amount of cigarette ends around the tables.",0
I go there pretty much every day with my 2 daughters. The small children park with is enclosed so you can let them play in the sand and relax on the benches. There is also a bigger kids area. The water fountain works fine and the are public bathrooms. It's also a space often used for community initiatives.,1

"This was a really neat place located smack dab in the middle of Montreal. It was quite a trek to get to the top, something not for the faint of heart or those not used to walking/climbing. That said, the view once you were at the top was fantastic! You are able to get drinks and light food once you're at the top and there are restrooms, too. Here's a tip: the restrooms are located in the basement of the building. There is one family style restroom on the main floor and a drinking fountain located close by. I saw several people that brought picnic food to enjoy, which is a great idea!  Another thing to note...the number of people. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and it was super, super busy. I'd recommend visiting if you are in town visiting.",1
Always nice to be there it's like getting back to the woods!,1

"I am disappointed with the clinic.  They followed my 2 cats for over 3 years now. Last week, I needed them to see my cat and they charged me as an emergency.  They change the politics, they only accept emergencies now and they didnt advice. I left the clinic with an invoice of almost 500$.

"Small nice place for a walk in the ""wilderness"". As in all the parks of Montreal visited so far, strong presence of squirrels, which as usual flee when you approach too much. It is a quiet place ideal for a romantic stroll, a jogging or a short bike ride, or even a picnic or a photo shoot if the weather is with you. Small flat, a tower found at one of the highest points of the park, and impossible to visit or approach the latter because of a dam grid! Hence my 4 stars and not 5.",1

There are no fountains here, however, or a lake or a romantic little bridge. We go there especially for tennis and less to dream about it. The whole thing lacks fountains and I don't know what makes a park bewitching",0

It has 2 basketball courts and a splashing pad for summer. You can bring snacks, cause they also have tables for sitting. I just didn't give 5 stars, cause you find some garbage and many squirrels trying to sneak food.",1
Montreal fireworks,1

Nice beach and clean place,1
"Came here after the rain, so the sky was still a bit cloudy so I couldn't really take good pictures. I wasn't sure which way I should go to see the best view, but this one wasn't pretty bad.

In summer a piano thrones there and pianists make the notes fly to the heavens for our lost friends and for the pleasure of the living who have not forgotten. A fountain would be appropriate. Better floral maintenance too.",0

"This is a large park north of Ave Laurier. It's excellent for people watching and dog observation. If you are lucky, a Chihuahua will come up to your ankle and smell it. The next thing you know, you will have made a new friend. I don't recommend trying this yourself with a fellow human. In the age of covid, smelling stranger's ankles is not only a social distancing taboo, but it's also kind of creepy. Unless you have been invited to do so, in which case, it's none of my business. You will be observed however: this is a public park.",1
Heritage beauty!,1

Excellent for practicing archery,1
Beautiful place zenitude,1
"It's where I skateboard, it's like the closest, decent place from my house, it's nice usually no problem skating, can accommodate up to maybe 50 skaters on both sides of all ability level, from grass ollies to curved ledge down a 15 set, also a big overpass to get manuals and stuff.  Ground is uneven it's like small tiles, but I find that's an advantage, though skatepark skaters probably will find the ride pretty bumpy, I recommend ditch wheels, but even park wheels are fine, just a bit slow.

Just my go-to skatepark near where I live...  Pretty chill crowd come here, too.  I like it...  *shrugs*",1

"One of my favourite places to be when meditating with the ancient trees. Unfortunately, this used to be a beautiful forest that was destroyed for the construction of the hideous A25 bridge. What's also unfortunate is that people litter a lot, and I spend a good portion of my time when visiting to be cleaning up after humans. If you visit, I ask that the greenery be respected.",1
The best park in Montreal. There is entrance fee.,1

one of the biggest parks i have been too. Couldnt really explore it much but it was quite enjoyable :),1
A calm location,1
Nice and calm. The early September air was crisp and rather chilly for a late summer evening. Heartening to see a lot of folks being active on a weekday. It was a bit early for the music to kick in the park else I would have hung around a bit more.,1

"Super very well equipped dog park! There is a good number of benches where the masters can sit. The fence is a very good height, I have never seen a dog successfully jumped over the fence. The majority of the park (95% l) is on the grass so our dear doggies do not come back all dirty and tasty from a good activity session at the dog park! The people who frequent the park usually all have good handlers who watch their dogs and know how to manage their dogs to avoid incidents. Water is accessible for dogs! So I highly recommend this park to people and their companions this lovely dog ‚Äã‚Äãpark.",1

There's a nice walk to a point where you can see the rapids. Best in the spring when the water is high.,1
"One of my favourite nature trails at any time of year with my kids. Lots of areas with picnic benches. By the water. There is a beach. My kids love the farm. You can buy vegetables and eggs from the farm. There are indoor toilets by the farm and outhouses along the trails. There is a nice diversity of trees if you're learning about nature with your kids. Also, this is part of a network of nature parks on this island. If you like going to these places regularly you can buy a year pass to save money.",1
Close to the water where you can go for a nice walk and naturally a great park for kids.,1

Lovely. Well maintained & preserved. Spacious & green,1
"It's a nice park with an open swimming pool close by. However I would personally suggest to avoid going during the late spring/summer. It gets way too crowded to have any enjoyment, with loud groups everywhere. It gets more quiet (less people) and enjoyable during fall season with the falling leaves.",1
Just beautiful‚ù§,1
Nice place with colorful furniture. Beautiful place of life. Too bad it isn't greener. I really like the illuminated pendant light which provides a lot of warmth in winter.,0

Too much dust in the summer. It‚Äôs a little silly to maintain a gravel field almost as big as a football field. Why not just plant grass? It would make more sense.,0

"Great little park for the community. Basketball court seems to be used quite frequently and the skatepark was once more popular than it is. I think it even has a legal graffiti wall which I think is a great alternative to tagging the cabane in the middle.

Even though it says no dogs, I have never seen it to be a problem as cops drive by constantly",1
"Sub par child's playground with few and unexciting structures. No shade around playground, but large brushes that obstruct parents' view. Loyola park, and Confederation park playgrounds are much better. Numerous trees were cut down some years ago (2010) to build an enclosed, year round pool. They were never replanted/replaced. There is a small, nice water-park next to the playground that had some shade. A recent microburst (2017) brought down those trees. There is a skateboard park that sees a lot of use.",0

The beach itself is very children friendly and my toddlers were able to play without any worry. As an added bonus there is a lifeguard on duty at all times.
The port-o-potties were surprisingly clean and devoid of smell, which was a great added bonus.
At 11am there was still plenty of room but by 2pm it was pretty packed on Sunday so arrive early to get a good spot!
All in all a pleasant experience at a decent price. Will redo for sure.",1

"The woodsiness is magnificent but there are double standards. The few people who go there with their dogs, at the risk of a huge ticket because it is prohibited, are all very polite. This is not the case with cyclists, also banned, who are extremely aggressive, who brush against you or touch you while passing at full speed and as a bonus send you for a walk ...",0

To all the parents who accompany the children to the park it is useful to be present if you are not really .... especially in the winter period teach your children to climb the mountain by the side and not in the middle .

My son to go into a little girl and boom the sleigh in the. figure .... it is very damaged üò† So please stay with your children and especially show them the good sense of life !!!!!! An angry mom,0
