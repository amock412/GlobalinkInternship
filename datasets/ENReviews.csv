"One of the nicest entry points to this inviting waterfront promenade along the St-Lawrence river.  Chalet also offers a public toilet during this Pandemic...much appreciated...just don't forget your mask.
Plenty of parking in the area.
A very enjoyable November day was had here today."
"Waterfront to fish or just relax, great place to picnic, hangout and watch the sunset. Amazing place."
Everything except the parking is good here.
"Defenely the best park in Montreal East, Tetreauville area. I love this park because it s big, plenty of space, loads of kids playgrounds, nice scenery, festivals and many other activities going on And there s a. Shuttle to go to ile de Charron...what elseüòÇ"
It's so peaceful and happy place near the water

Nice place to relax
Very nice place

Cool
Correct...
Very nice rivershore park!
Picnic
Tr√®s beau mes j'aimerais pouvoir descendre au bord de l'eau pour baigner mon chien il a pas d'acc√®s au fauteuil √©lectrique
"Magnifique, super endroit que ce soit pour faire du v√©lo ou du sport ou m√™me avoir une date ou juste chiller avec ces amis.
Une vue prenantes sur le fleuveüòç"
Tres belle place sur le bord de leau
"This little park is a great place to meditate, the traffic isn't too loud due to low speeds. It's tranquil"
Good place to sit and drink socially distanced coffees.
"It's not exactly a park, nor is it even a square. Nice place to sit while you wait for a bus or cool in the shade in the few seats available, nice green space but rather small."
Nice place but not my favourite
Very nice view for the sunsets
Solid
"Tennis courts, soccer field, 1 basketball net. Great local park."
Playing soccer
"Reasonably good neighborhood park.
Tennis, dog park, soccer fields"
"Field is uneven, represents risks for players. House is OK and convenient, but users/visitors do not care to respect it."
Great place for kids soccer has tennis courts
Good soccer pitch... maintained by the LaSalle council
"Great place to go play tennis, soccer or half court basketball."
Great hidden spot.. not much parking though
Soccer nets/Tennis court/Basketball net
Large empty field with soccer markings and nets. No seating available and no lights for evening games.
Can the Tennis courts be reserved?
Nice park
No lights
Basics
"grass not cut, big pile of durt in front of basketball net making impossible to use"
üòä
"This is a five star park.
Reason is simple. It fulfills irs basic function as a park, providing a clean friendly and multidimensional  option to all users, no matter their age.
Kids can play in the playground, enjoying outdoor and nature. The park is huge, more than enough for all the kids in the neighborhood.
Youth can gather there to play a game , soccer or whatever that fit their mood.
Couples can take a walk or find a bench and chat.
For runners and joggers, there is a  1.5 km route or a 2 km route, whatever they want. Or combine them for a few round to make 5 km.
For students, the park is by the side of a library. It is convenient to do something else beside studying.
For a family, just go there. Free to choose whatever.
Cream on the icing, there is a beautiful lake."
"Best place in Saint Laurent.
Jogging, tennis, soccer, skateboarding, a small hike, a small party place....you name it!
They maintain it very well. Lots of school games done here. You can come with your kids sit around and they play, fly kite etc.
Come with your dog for walking. Overall good public place for gathering."
"An enchanting place for all.  I took a most enjoyable stroll admiring the lush green throughout the park.  The ducks, fish and turtles swam contently in their pond adding to the charm of this most scenic park.
Impeccably clean and suitable for all tastes.  The numerous athletic fields, indoor ice-rink, and jogging and cycling paths welcome the sporty type.  As for us romantics, a blanket under the rich foliage of one of the many trees is more than enough to reward any nature-lover."
It's a great little park for a walk with your lady (or gentleman if you are a lady) in the evening or very early in the morning.
Good park for kids üòú because there's zones reserved for a certain age so there's not other kids disturbing your childs
It's a wonderful place to do sports and enjoy nature
Love this skatepark   also lots of soccer fields
"Great place to be with friends and family.
Lots of open space for kids to play while maintaining social distancing."
Spacious enough for large outdoor activities ‚úå
This place is so peaceful specially near the pound. It feels cool near water and it's worth to visit if you don't like crowd. Then you should visit this parc.
Beautiful walk through the woods!
"Beautiful little oasis in the middle of residential, commercial and industrial area. Lots of wild life and remnants of a creek that used to drain the wetlands of the area. A library was built next to it a few years ago and looks out on it."
It's a park and you can have a picnic I think . There's a couple of people there normally and close to bus stop
"A nice piece of nature in the city. The only place to see some unique bird species, as well."
The track has been redone and isn't disgusting anymore. Large empty soccer fields to activities.
"Nice quiet place to go for a walk or jog, just not when it snows super slippery and the signs say no dogs but that doesn't help people from walking them n not cleaning up after them."
"A very large beautiful park full of amenities. Soccer fields, running track, tennis courts, plus beautiful paths for walking and running along pond with ducks and geese and a waterfall, or through forested wooded areas."
Hidden oasis in the heart of an industrial area
"I love this place, so quiet and amazing views"
Nice and calm place. Beautiful scene.
"Beautiful place to walk around or take pictures, even for weddings"
"Perfect in every possible way, except that the toilets close at 6pm."
Beautiful landscape and lake. A little bit crowded.
Nice track
"I really loved this park, because their is a lot  of space to play tennis, to walk around and to have pique-nique."
"The park is great. It is clean and big. You should definitely walk through the section found into Bois-Franc. Many birds and other wildlife spend their time in the pond making it a very calming escape. There is also another similar space at a 10 minute walk from there, deeper into Bois-Franc."
"I would have rated it a 5 but for the fact that there is no signage anywhere. The place is huge and has at least 13 soccer fields. Had there not been city employees to direct me, i'd still be looking for the correct field."
Best park ever
Beautiful park
Made snowman with my grandchildren.
Amazing walks with your first date
ML was very quite today and I loved that...üåû
Beautiful park.
Enjoyed the place
best free open running track!
Amazing landscaping and great neighborhood.  Perfect for younger families with kids. Plenty of outdoor activities for everyone.
I love the green space. Though I wish the city would spend capital on implementing turf soccer fields. In this climate it is difficult and expensive to properly maintain grass fields.
"Has everything tennis, soccer, running track, baseball. An athlete's dream place to go to."
Very beautiful park. In the pond you can find carp fish. Kids will love it. There is a well maintained path way around the pond.
Nice place to go for a quiet walk or a romantic walk and a nice big park for your kids to go play
A lovely walk near the airport hotels.  There is a thousand meter loop walk through nice woods with a small Creek and signs describing the flona. Don't miss the pond and fountain on the north separated from the woods. It's an easy 30 minute walk from the crown plaza and nearby hotels. Great place to kill a couple hours in an otherwise desolate industrial area.
"Spacious, varied and well kept"
"This park is pretty large compared to others near it. It has a swimming pool, a playground, a basketball terrain, a baseball terrain, as well as a football field. I'm found of sitting in the shadows of the trees in this park, I really like it!"
Very relaxing and nice view
Beautiful üòç
"Loads of soccer field, arena, sports complex and library are next to it. Although grass need a little treatment. There is also a nice little woods right beside it."
"Love this park, unfortunately ignorant people keep throwing their garbage after eating and feeding the birds and fish even if there's a clear sign not to do so!"
"Very good prices, good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in Europe.

Good quality stuff!

I would go there every time in the future for all their products as they are very good.

Every time I go there I take the special of the day which is good all time, winter and summer, especially in the eveningk when the parking is available."
Nice big park with lot‚Äôs of facilities and a dog park as well.
Nice park although not very many dogs go there it depends on the day. Lots of owners do not want pick up after their dog.
"Beautiful park in the heart of ville saint Laurent. Civic center with pool, tennis courts and other facilities. Library ."
It's so nice but after sunset there is so many mustc
"This park is so large!!!  Soccer fields for different ages, a baseball field/pitch? Lots of light when it gets darker and friendly staff who set up fields and take them down."
Softball game. The field is nice and well taken care of but there was trash pretty much everywhere near the fields. The garbage was overflowing and people didn't seem to mind it.
It's calm and relaxing but there is sometimes a bad odour
Great park with lots of soccer fields as well as a track and field location. It's adjacent to a library and small nature reserve. It's quite clean with lots of parking and beautiful scenery
Nice trails to walk in and it's just a block away from my work!
"Still under development. Not a park to leave kids unsupervised, as it is rather exposed on all sides and close to two rat run streets. Gives good views of Vanier and nearby buildings. Nice place for sunset summer walks."
Very nice park. Always enjoy it when we have practice there or games. Parking is not always easy.
Park is beautiful and excellent but the security gard is an idiot.
Great urban park with a ton of place to play sports
Great place to spend a whole day in there...
"PROS: near shopping malls\ well kept \ free\right beside police station
CONS: none"
Great atmosphere and quiet good to relax üòÄüòÅ
"Great place to go for a walk, clean and friendly environment"
A very relaxing place and it's perfect for kids...
This is the parc I went to every day to eat while I was in high school. I still go there multiple times a month to enjoy the scenery and take pictures. Go there when the weather allows you and take a walk on the path that surrounds the path and threw the forest.
This is an amazing park but it seriously needs more garbage bins.
"Great place to play soccer. Reserving a field is difficult, but try to reserve one if you can. You might be kicked out by someone with a reservation otherwise :("
Very good
"Great place for soccer, football and tennis. They also have a indoor sport center where you can play soccer, a swimming pool, basketball court, a weight training room."
Very good place to relax fie everyone
Clean beautiful well maintained. You can have a pleasant time if you don't mind the noise of the airplanes descending torwards the the nearby airport.
Ppl can be disrespectful at times
"A decent park during the day with okay scenery. The path through the woods is nothing special. Watch out at night as it tends to be filled with ""rats"" from the nearby crappy area."
Beautiful. Love walking around here.
Nice park with pic nic tables
Nice place to go for a walk and take a load off
"A lot of things to do in this park, biking, skating, jogging, etc. Location is convenient, parking, library, sport center and a mall is just walking distance."
Awrsome design.  Beautiful park. Great place to spend the afternoon
Fantastic library. An added bonus is their free art gallery
Amazing park. Better than Disney land.
"Great parc for sports. Tennis, soccer, baseball, track and field"
AMBIANCE! EXCELLENT PLACE FOR KIDS
Lovely park. A forest in our neighborhood which our kids loved to go
Really Cozy...big thx to the Municipality
Nice park in Nouveau Saint-Laurent awaiy from the city turmoil....
"Went there for a kids soccer game. Didn't really get to see all of the park but it seems huge. Lots of fields, arena and tennis courts."
Lots of open area for kids to play and even a cute little place for picnics
Haven't seen the whole thing but the waterside is cool. For anything.
"Nice big park , with a big pond , skate park, several soccer field and a conditioned running track. It is also linked to the ""bois√©"" wich is a small wooded area , a little urban forest. Although, have good rain boots or shoes on rainy days, some parts of the ground on the park have bad water retention so there are small puddles on the grass that can get your shoes, socks wet."
So far so good till now . all is going well
Great place for sports and family activities
Nice park with many soccer fields and a large dog park. Dogs are unfortunately not allowed in the park itself.
Beautiful
Hard to find what you need. A map would be helpful.
A nice quiet place to walk and relax
Lovely peaceful location in a residential area
"A nice parc, with lots of fields for sports. The only knock is the softball diamond had a lip around the infield that tends to kick the ball up towards people's faces..."
Good park

Very dirty but it is only beginning of spring
Peaceful & cute

"Verdun is a town that does not lack public spaces, especially the long green stretches that run along the St-Lawrence. People who live in the town or don't have that long to drive use Turtle Wharf Park regularly, be it for walks along the river, bike rides along its very long and very spacious bicycle paths, as a picnic site with the family, for its petanque courts,  or simply as a place to relax and watch the world go by."
Great big park. Great for cooling off on a hot summer day or to have a picnic. A beautiful walk or a bike ride!
Beautiful cold Canadian day.
"Really relaxing here, they took away the dock from. Here though!. But always people here. Fishing and chilling üòå"
"Beautiful place to enjoy strolling with friends and family all four seasons. Yup, even in the winter !"
"Spacious, very accessible by car and public transit, nicely situated near the river. There is everything that you need to organize a picnic, outdoor games and so much more. The bicycle path makes it easy access and fun for the seekers of an active lifestyle and exercise. The playground is nice, safe to use for the young children and the sprinklers are very appreciated by the kids of every age."
Great to spend time with love ones
Beaitiful spot to witness the sun rise or the moon rise. Magic every morning waiting for you to discover. Stay blessed. Stay grateful.
I live in the area and love it. There are kilometers of trail along the waterfront that you can take advantage of.
"Beautiful place to walk, relax or to have meal."
Really a great park with water splash for kids
Good for outing.
Great view of the moon rise
Great place for a pique nique. Lots of room for everyone and social distancing is not a challenge. Also the grounds are usually quite clean and haven't seen any broken glass or any other dangers on the ground.
Really lovely area. Bit of a strong current but still quite nice ^_^
Beautiful place to see the sunset with a special someone.
"The nature in the city! A walk will conquer you. In all season this place has charms. When tired from the busy life, this place will free your mind. A walk along the shore is like magic."
Saw the Solar and Lunar eclipse ascend over the waters horizon. It was beautiful
"Beautiful outdoors for picnic, sports, and ALL else"
Spectacular üòä
Nice views
"Walk this place almost daily year 'round. Love it. The best part outside the summer season is that there is almost nobody, it is clean(no thrash left behind by all these summer people) and ...there is absolutely no bugs!"
Is a very peaceful place.
Nice place
Great place to chill
"Its one of many parcs stretched  on verdun  river area,  often quit and good for biking and long walks."
"This park is great in the summer. Locals in the area gather for some rest and relaxation, or just to have fun. There's a long and scenic bicycle path that extends all the way to Lachine. There are also a couple of public pools, a skate park, and public art installations. I love coming here in the summer to hang in my hammock next to the Saint Lawrence. The best of all is that it's tourist-free."
"Good place to relax in summer
It also has cycling track"
Best park in the west
Nice walk to chase the blues away.
Very nice quiet park
So beautiful place
Great place!
"A well kept park! Perhaps a few more sitting areas, but all in all honesty I like the open green space."
Gotta love the view and the people! Walk down a paved road or a dirt road the choice is yours! Just as nice in winter as summer
Great view.
Beautiful parc with water views.  Great for picnics.  They have a splash pad as well.

"Nice to walk,jog, bike and play. Remember to wear insect repellents üòÖüòÇ"
Beutiful! There is a great place to go with family a lot of fun!

Beautiful spot for lots of activities. You can visit this park all year long. Sunrises and sunsets are the best times.
Absolutly beautifull¬°¬°¬°my granddaughter and me love going there¬°
"Lovely.  I walk here almost every day.  The mornings are perfect and a great dose of nature therapy.  Excellent for family outings, picnics, exercise, etc."
I love this guys.They are my family.Will miss me a lot
This is a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of these times
"Nice spot to enjoy the sun beside the water. There's not many toilets across the whole park, so be prepared. Not many fountain either. But the view is still worth it."
Absolutely beautiful.  Great place to distress
It was peaceful and super close to the bike path. There's also benches to have an easy picnic :)
"If love the water and nature, this is a good trail to explore, enjoy nature, have picnics. Connected via the cycling trail."
It was family friendly and fun to just go and picnic. There's tons of space for kids and the water parks a plus
Beautiful spot for birding. Great for walks.
Nice place to park it and munch some lunch.
Good area. Nice for walks or a bike ride. In the evening people tend to get drunk down by the river lol.
Great place for a pitstop but a lot of heavy drinkers are hanging there. The park is big enough to get a different spot for a family piknik.
"Too much people party there in the afternoon, might not be the best place if you're looking for a calm and soothing place to enjoy the view (which is quite nice, unfortunately). Beware of the smell of joints and smoke is also very present which is quite nauseating."
Multiple bike connections.
I like turtles
Amazing
Pleasant place
"Love the fresh air here and the views,  can easily spend a hole afternoon strolling or biking!"
"It's a park near the fleuve st-laurant,it's vast and it has a few benches and tables."
Very good place with a nice background!
Nice place to walking and breathing
No problem
Nice to revisit the place of my childhood
Nice once the water & road construction ends
"This park is perfect, there is a little water park for the kids."

Was a great area with places next to the water
"Great Family park to bring your kids and have a bday party or a family picnic
Open space to play games picnic tables to eat. Garbage cans to clean up."
Un lieu de pr√©dilection quand on √©tait jeune...
"A really nice little hike up where you can have a really nice overview of the city.

For anyone concerned that it might be difficult there is a short cut route with stairs to make it a bit easier going up there. Alternatively if you have a bike or want to challenge yourself there is a long route as well."
"Mt. Royal park was truly an adventure with an awesome staircase to the top and a spectacular lookout on the top of the hill.  At the top there is a concession coffee shop, wooded trails and a road for walking.  Whether you are looking for a ‚Ä¶"
"""Beautifully awesome!' Mobile bathrooms clean enough with sanitizers. Lots of dancers and drummers on Sundays only. Summer is quite short."
"The most valuable, colorful and enjoyable outdoor space in Montreal. Worth visiting again and again in four season.It is the real version of the classical music Four Season in real life.
Whether you are tourist or local, there are too many ways to enjoy this park, by car, by foot, by bike , alone or with friends and family.The path you choose each will be a different experience.
Consult Google map to pick your starting point. Have fun.
Life is beautiful."
"Large, beautiful space. Nice hiking trails criss-cross more main paths and roads."
"Pretty chill, pretty nice. We were on the top of Beaver Lake.

The new tables are pretty amazing and we'll designed. They just dirty a bit but I mean what can you do.

Thrash bins are all around so very practical for BBQs and parties"
"A must-visit when you want to experience Montreal. Even as a local, the view is never less than breathtaking. Worth going at least twice - once during the day, then again at night; Romantic spot when not overwhelmed with people."
I do love going there on a week day. But try to avoid weekends when weather is too nice there's too many people and gets too crowded.
Nice relaxing walk from parking area (not too steep). The big cross that lights up is close to the highest point but the lookout view point that you might recognize from the Google picture is by the Mount royal chalet in the direction of ' Smith House ' . The signs will help guide you. Its an amazing place to take pictures andsoak in the view.
This place is astonishing. Worth walking to the top where you can overlook the city and it's so relaxing.
"A real treasure. Can easily spend a day cycling or walking through beautiful forested areas, with the crown on top, being the lookout over the city."
"The Park is a super attraction in the city, a huge green area just a few minutes from downtown.
During the spring and summer, when visited, is a quite nice place to play sports, walk around or just rest.
The view of Montreal city is definitely gorgeous."
Great place for sunset and sunrise . You can view the entire downtown from here.
Amazing piece of nature in the middle of bustling downtown Montreal. Hiking up the mountain on a crisp early morning is healing for the soul.
We had a free day in Montreal so we headed up the path to Mt. Royal. What a lovely place to see the city. Beautiful forests and wonderful path. Not too steep and certainly doable by all ages!
Great park. Perfect for a family picnic or just to walk around and escape the city even though it's all around you.
"You have to pay for the parking there. Its a calm place near the stressfull area of downtown.
You can allways count on finding a parking there. But if you have a metro card, come with bus.
There are a lot of people running here everyday.
Sometimes people come here after graduation party. Or sometimes after wedding party."
Good place to ride your mtb or jogging. About 5 km from the foot of the mountain. Also have great autumn leaves. Highly recommended if you are visiting montreal
"The experience:
Visited the park during spring 2021. The trails leading up to the great house and lookout has beautiful trees and lots of birds and some wildlife. It is definitely a closer walk to nature in the middle of the city. The walk from parking to the top is approximately 15 mins at regular pace with kids. At the top of the lookout you are able to see all of downtown Montreal, The historic bridges and the harbour. If you have binoculars I highly recommend bringing them.

Other:
There were bathrooms on site, I can't speak to cleanliness though. And there's a small cafe that sells coffee and a few small food items. But bring your own water though, prices are touristy."
How beautiful. Better than central park in new York city. Many peaceful spots. Great for excercise.
Go to spot for a nice panoramic view of Montreal. Chose an evening with a clear sky to enjoy the beautiful sunset. Gets super busy due to popularity.
Really great place to unwind alone or with friends just enjoy to view. Much better at sun down or sunrise. Whether you‚Äôre in your car or outside. Due to these day and age it‚Äôs getting harder to stay inside
Great hiking spot and the view is great. Took some nice pictures üòä
It's a great place to go and spend the day just having a lot of fun things to do
Beautiful park at the top of Mont-Royal where you‚Äôll find 2-3 little coffee/bistros to grab a drink or bite to eat. The park is well kept and offers and clean environment. Public bathrooms are also available and are surprisingly clean!
Mount-Royal is the most beautiful place in Montreal. Must visit. Love it. I can write pages and pages and neber enought to describe the beauty of this place
"Amid the stress brought on by the pandemic,  it is nice to have an outdoor location to enjoy nature within the city."
Lovely park. The only issue is that there is no cafe or proper washroom up there since Covid. So bring some snacks or drinks if you want to stay longer. There are mobile washroom cabins in the area.
"It was very good place. A big area with lots of tress, grasses & flowers.
Benches to sit. Places to make BBQ. A big lake. Totally it is different part in Montreal"
"the climb is not an easy stroll but it's not a gruelling march either. It's just the best way to climb the mountain. Coming back down, we meandered through the mountain paths which led us to Park Avenue but you may choose to explore the western part of the park"
A nice place to walk and jog. You can view the stunning downtown Montreal.
"Cool place with nice trekking areas , castor lake you can rent a boat and wild animals. Pay parking with credit card or coins. Debit card doesn't work"
"We were two adults two pre-teen and one teen. It was as a gorgeous day, still icy but the view was amazing. Everybody enjoyed the peaceful tracks."
"Went jogging this morning a bit before the sunrise. Only a half dozen of people were in the area. This park is amazing, there is a small lake at the top with boats to be rented, large picnic area and a small decent playground for children. I was impressed with the cleanness of the paths and the amazing view. I was luck and saw a real beaver walking around. Just beside you find a cemetery. If you like arts, there are some sculptures spread out in the park."
"my visit was beautiful; the leaves had mostly fallen, so you could see the bones of the mountain, and the leaves and their aroma created a completely autumnal duet. it was a precious moment, in the soft 18C¬∞ November day. I was once again very thankful for this oasis in the middle of our beautiful city."
"Great place for enjoying sunrise and sunset.
Great place for walking around the lake and the mount.
You can see large parts of Montreal whe you reach the Mountain top. I love this place , Summer and Winter"
"Best place in downtown Montreal for immersing urself in nature after a long day at work. Outstanding views and lookouts, lots of tracks for working out. Best time to visit during Summer and Fall"
"It's a beautiful park, lots of tree's a lake in the middle,  places for a BBQ, there's car parking, bike trails, walking trails, great for long boarding. Easily reached by bus too"
Very nice place to visit. But be very careful of the parking spot. There is a big Stone right infront of the parking machine. And I had a vig scratch in my car beacuse of these. This is such a irresponsibility of the parking authority.  Please guys be careful of this stupid stone.
"We are sooooo lucky to have such a beautiful Parc in the heart of montreal. Thank you to all those that work hard to keep it clean, that work hard to keep it out of developers hands.
Definitely worth exploring Mount Royal. The nature trails are easy and well kept.
Go out and enjoy. Bring your furry friend too."
"Wow! What a nice park. Just traveling through Montreal and happened to stop by the park on the way into town. This is a huge park. There is plenty of parking and some awesome views of the city.

There is also a fantastic lake with a small man made waterfall. It is a great spot for a walk on a hot summer day. They also have a large hill that is all grass to relax and enjoy the day."
"Breathtaking! We are all so fortunate to have this incredible mountain right in the heart of our city.  The lake, trees, paths  the lookout.  It's the perfect place to escape to and reenergize   even just for a moment."
A very beautiful place. Nice little trek and an awesome lake.
"Usually I don't go up to mount royal Park during the winter months ( I drive a three wheeler electric bike) but the first few weeks of January were mild so I decided to go, went to beaver lake and the look out with the chalet, both places had a lot of people, beaver lake people were skating but no was tobogganing, the look out was a great place to see the downtown core, there was even a guy flying a drone, these areas were clear enough so that I had access with my bike.
I have fun that day."
"Huge park right in the heart of Montreal. There's lots of trails, bike paths, and even cross country skiing in the winter. The pond at south of the mountain is really nice if you want to have a picnic or just enjoy the nice weather. The chalet can get a little crowded but the view at the top is very nice. You see the Downtown Montreal skyline, the water, and bridges. This park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted (who also co-designed New York City's Central Park) and the park is just beautiful."
It's a beautiful park but parking at the top is really a pain. The ticket machines don't always accept credit cards so be sure to bring lots of change. (No bills)
"A place too comfortable, everyone is happy.  Whether in winter or summer, this is a good choice for the whole family."
"Classic attraction of Montreal that offers trails for walking and cross-country skiing as well as a skating area, a lake, amazing views, a cafe, several famous landmarks like the cross and an incredible diversity of animals. Accessible by car, bike, bus and by foot. You'll have a great time in this park on Mount Royal."
"Really nice, big and well protected. Stay on the paths to protect the wildlife!"
Great place with some awesome views of the city! Always enjoy being there!
Great spot for a short hike or a full day picnic or watch the sunset or just to get away from the city noise. All right in the middle of the city.
"Nice long walking trails. A variety of ways to get up the mountain, from relatively gentle slopes to steep mud trails. Large green fields and plenty of places to picnic or chill."
"Amazingly place to escape the city life. Great place to visit during all seasons. Lots to do and explore. Always something to see and discovery. The view is amazing, relaxing area, great trails, easy access.
Mother nature is beautiful.
I have taken a few friends here to show the fee and to explore the mountain.
Never a bad time to go :)"
"Amazing place for every one to visit and see the very very nice view for Montreal , and you can see amazing sunset"
"Reachable from any part of Montreal..you can walk down from Mon Royal chalet to Peel avenue via stairs,even winters,though one has to be more careful"
"Beautiful experience, it is a awesome place to stay in the afternoon, we can prepare food and walk around the lake."
Great place to bring your family for a walk or picnic.
"Beautiful place to relax and let go the mind, an amazing spot to have the best view of montreal. Perfect to do some ice skating, slides with the kids, and have a beer or hot chocolate depending on your mood."
Could use more accessible options. Husband and I couldn't get to the viewing platform due to my health issues.  Still managed to walk the trails for an hour and a half enjoying the great fall colors!
"Beaver lake is a great place to spend the afternoon with the kids. The picnic tables, playground, open area and the pond keep are perfect for families."
"Went sliding, it was super fun and safe. Beautiful park. Covid restrictions make it impossible to ice skate. The line is 1 to 2 hours long and when you finally get to the lake it's not even free skating. You have to skate in a circle which is kind of boring."
"One of the best spot to see Montreal cityscape!

This is one of the places that I bring all my visitors to when they come to Montreal for the first time or many time thereafter. I just love the views of the city and St Lawrence river.

The terrace is big and always exuberant, great spot to relax, chill out in the summer."
"Pride of Montreal, beautiful and very well equipped park. Great city overlooking terrace."
This place is so magical! An oasis in the city all year round!
Nice view but should have more water fountains and more washrooms
"Beautiful during the summer. Proposed to my now wife here :) Dress appropriately though, because hiking 3 hours in 25+ heat in jeans was probably the worst idea of my life."
Beautifull view of montreal
Great place to enjoy the outdoors in the middle of the city
The park is incredible until you waited 30-45 mins for the bathroom.
The best getaway within the island...green open spaces and nice cozy walkways
This place gives you a true touristy spot feel as a local....absolutely stunning views of the city. You can also spot huge raccoons. Sunset is phenomenal. Night view is stunning as well. Place is absolutely worth it!
"An amazing place to visit. Must see. There's a fantastic view of the city once you get at the top. Difficult to get a good photo spot since everyone is taking photos but some people are considerate and will move on and let you take a photo. Some people have tripods during dusk so they wouldn't be moving. The walk from the car park isn't that bad. There are raccoons on the way that kids will love. There's a piano in the open at the top so you can play it, if you want, once you're done taking photos and enjoying the city skyline."
"Beautiful scenery as always. We always take our social media agency clients from out of town to this location.

Gives them a gorgeous overview of Montreal City! With all the lights and skyscrapers.  Its something you must seee when visiting or living in the great city of Montreal!

Looking forward to going back next spring!"
Absolutely beautiful in winter! Grab a sled and have some fun! It's nice to know that despite the pandemic we can still find ways to enjoy ourselves
Terrace views were beautiful. There are several walking paths of varying difficulties. The ‚Äúhouse‚Äù right by the terrace is pretty with good sized restrooms and a small gift shop. We walked one of the trails and did not find it real well marked.
"Quite nice. Is definetely nice to be able to walk around, unlike summer that is soooo full of people."
"Very large and nice area to visit! I enjoyed seeing Montreal city from up high to view the landscape. There is a cafe as well, which is not to bad, but wished there was more options in the menu."
Awesome but it started raining so couldn't enjoy.
Amazing park right in the middle of the city. Great views of the city skyline. Decently short hike just a lot of stairs. There are spots to break and sit. Would highly recommend this park to anyone in the area!
"Truly a gem in the middle of a city. Woods, open green space, a spectacular look out viewing beautiful Montreal from above...the list goes on. Best to go during the week as the weekends can be super busy and hard to find parking."
It was fantastic and mind blowing place to visit with family and friends.. nice place for jogging and BBQ on spring and summer... Love this park.. best place to have fun‚Å∏
Busy in the park on a sunny afternoon.  Good views.  Fresh air.
"One of the best place in montreal to go if your a tourist or a traveler. Or if your a local person, this place is the most "" nature friendly "" area in the entire city. Paths are well made for everyone to walk or to jog or to hike .. or to ski during winter. In summer time , you can BBQ with your family... or simply walk and take pictures of nature... or simply rest and tan your awesome body on the Hills or Lac Des Castors. There is also a place where you can see the city view of Montreal if you walk all the way up to the north side ( just follow everyone ). There, you can take pictures and enjoy the view as family, friends... or as a couple in love. It's very beautiful either in summer, spring, fall or even winter."
A nice paronamic view over MTL.
"Mount Royal is the most beautiful place you can hike in Montreal. There's a map in the Jean Mance Park which outlines the varying degrees of height and steepness of different parts of the mountain which is useful in choosing which route to take. Regardless of your choice, if you can try to stray off the trails, though stay safe! There's lots of glass in the non-paved areas of the mountain, though these areas make for an exciting climb!"
The short hike was great! Make sure to bring some warm clothes as I can get very cold up there
The park is very beautiful at the top. You can see the entire city of Montreal from here.
"Spectacular scenery with lots of fun. It is better to be there for sunrise or sunset. For me, it can be said as the ""eye of Montreal""."
Great vue but get ready for a long walk if your going all the way up
Perfect at this time of day. Not too crowded
Lovely place to enjoy an evening for a walk or picnic.
"Beautiful park for all kinds of activities, and with a beautiful view of downtown."
"Perfect for hiking, there‚Äôs so many paths to take a hike/walk. We walked 12k steps from Lac-Des-Castors to Belv√©d√®re Camillien-Houde. A MUST specially during Fall, all trees starts changing color."
"Such a privilege to have a diverse,  luxuriant, maintained and safe piece of nature the size of Mount Royal in the heart of a city this size.
Summer or winter, from 06:00 to midnight it is open and one can do so many different activities from simple walking and sightseeing in summer to cross country skewing and racket walks in winter and everything in between.
I would definitely improve the signage buy otherwise (again) what a privilege <3"
"Montreal Canada is blessed with a mountain in the middle of the city.   Bike trails,  walking trails,  picnic and more"
"Great place to walk, jog, relax, exercise, picnic...must go!"
Beautiful park with hiking and amazing views. Good place to sit and relax near the lake at the top. Nice view of the city from the top as well. Kids had fun on the playground and waterfall near the top too.
Absolutely amazing spot to see the city. Tres tres biane
Best place in Montr√©al! Would be sick if we could shoot with a drone there! But the law doesn't permit it ü•∫
"Beautiful park, Great lookout view of downtown Montreal!"
Beautiful location with plenty of space for social distancing. Definitely a great place to enjoy a nice day out. The walk up the mountain takes a good chunk of time as well so you'll definitely get your step count higher.
The best part of Montreal is Mont Royal. No wonder they named the city after it!! The hike was moderate ‚Äî lots of stairs. But the view from the top was really nice. We squeezed the whole hike into a couple of hours before dinner ‚Äî totally doable.
"The mountain (Mount Royal Park), was absolutetly enchanting. The trails for walking were well groomed even after the snow fall and another parallel trail for cross country skiers was in mint condition. Children and dogs (on leashes) were plentiful which really made the walk come alive. If however, you want more tranquility a myriad of trails are there for the walking in the forest. The views of the city can't be beat and at the end Beaver Lake with it's Waltzes playing and skaters not to mention the hot chocolate. Simply the best way to spend a Sunday afternoon. No wonder this jewel of a park is so prized by Montrealers and visitors alike.
By the way did you know that Montreal is the only city built entirely around a Mountain?"
Wonderfully well maintained paths to the top and around the mountain. Be careful it can be a bit slippy so wear shoes with grip.
"Nice place to visit from April to October. Wide trails taking you to all sides of the mountain, great views at different locations on the mountain. Must visit if you love walking and jogging in nature. Best park on the island of Montreal and easily accessible by car."
"Designed by the same guy who designed the Central Park (Olmsted) the park has a plethora of activities to offer. Ranging from jogging/biking trails to easy hikes and cross country skiing paths during the winter. During summer, it's a good spot to barbecue and chill with family/friends."
"This is the place from where this city name called as Montreal, it's the main tourist attraction in this city, beautiful mesmerizing view of downtown and wide view of Montreal and nearby locations, fresh air with all natural sights, it has lake, bike rides, tracks, all small activities with friends and family you can enjoy here. Beware from Racoons üòÜüòÜüëçüëçüòöüòöü•∞ü•∞"
Two summers since I was here and I loved the park! It is worth walking/hiking to gravel road to the top and there is small lake just below the top. I was with my sister and she was not down with exploring the side trails but they looked interesting to explore. I like this park more than Central Park in NYC.
Great park to walk around enjoying the outdoors nice place for a picnic as well very family oriented
Definitely a amazing view of downtown Montreal especially at night but during the day it can be crowded with people taking pics but definitely worth a visit
The park is not really for sledders  primarily for cross country skiers.  You and your children will have more fun sliding down your local neighborhood hill.
"Great place to visit in Montreal, two main parking on site and charge 3.5$ for one hour. Besides the top view, there are good trails and  picnic areas. Would spend more time here next time."
"Not very full grass to sit on, bring a blanket. But very peaceful. Great trails for walking."
Great views of the city all year round. Bring a picnic or try the food on site... basic stuff.  Great hiking spot with lots of trails.  Parking is not free.  Lots to do no matter the weather.    Do not recommend walking up the road from the bottom though... can be dangerous with cars busses and cyclists all sharing the space
"I enjoyed the experience a lot
And Montr√©al looks charming from the top"
"Went for a nice hike/walk during the winter. There were many activities for all ages. Tobogganing/tubing cross country skiing, snowshoeing, skating, walking and you can bring your dogs for a nice walk. I haven't been during the summer, but I can only imagine how nice it would be as well. The staff were very nice and answered questions I had."
Awesome family-friendly environment that has amazing views. Definitely should check it out while in town. My daughter had a blast! Love Montreal!
Great spot to go by yourself or with loved ones.  Amazing view of the city
"Mount Royal owes its name to Jacques Cartier who then turned the name Mont Royal to name the city Montreal! It is nicknamed the ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô by Montrealers. The park atop the mountain created in 1876 and designed by the same landscape architect as the Central Park in New York, Frederick Law Olmsted."
"Beautiful üíï They put in trailer bathrooms near the Belvedere, but sadly the caf√© is closed."
It feels like you are on the top of the world will recommend you guys to visit this place at night the city of Montreal looks perfectly splendid. If you want to visit it with car make sure to pit Mount royale parking in your google maps. The lights in the night is just so mesmerizing.
"Great place for a hike, the effort pays when you get to the top and get to see a glimpse of Montreal from one spot. Its quite a hike but truly worth it. I'd recommend to go there when its not that hot outside, you'll be left panting."
"Incredibly beautiful scenery and amazing park in general, especially during Winter it's just manificent but there are plenty of people that litter everywhere which is ruining the scenery and may even dangerous/deadly to the animals living there, but again, apart from that, I think this park is absolutely wonderful"
"Never got tired of this place. Make sure to walk in all the walking tracks, you‚Äôll find some beautiful spots if you try them."
Fresh air green spaces relaxing atmosphere lovely people walking running bicycling all ages splendid time for everyone. But there can be many people at times
Very good place nice view. A view of Montreal downtown is perfect.
"Loved the view from this place. The walk or run up is completely worth it. There are a couple levels. One overlooking Montr√©al, the second is the cross, the third is a tower of some kind, there is a rock before reaching the summit with a nice sunset view, and lastly there is the summit with another tower. Had fun with my family and great exercise. Completely recommend it and everyone can go at their own pace."
Great place to ride slow and enjoy surroundings
Charming place with hiking and biking opportunities. You will get a view of the whole Montreal city from the top. Different views in daytime and nighttime. A must try.
Great big park for a picnic and a bottle of wine!
"Nice trails, very popular on weekends.
Tobogganing on Parc side is fun.
Good skating well maintained rink at Beaver lake."
Very beautiful park to visit. There are so many people doing different activities and there's also a spot where you can see the whole city.
"Spectacular view of Montreal from here.

You can drive or just climb some stairs to get to the top. I was there in the mornng after a snowstorm and it is a fairly easy mountain to go. Though the snow was a bit thick which made it hard to find the trail, the path to the top isn't long at all (around 45 minutes for a first time visitor I guess).

A reminder is to wear boots for snowy days.   I didn't wear a snowboot cause I only brought one pair of shoes with me and my feet were soaked with snow.

Other than that there is no reason for not going there honestly. Easy to go and great view.

Pick a day with good weather and blue sky. Definitely worth it !"
"Looking up just made me want to go up. Then when I got there,  I was happy. Truly worth the experience of walking up. Spent some time wondering around but even that was nice. Good to run,  ride your bike,  or walk with people."
Always a nice break from the daily grind.
Wow a wonderful place to spend the day with family and friends.
Excellent view
"A must visit place for canadians and tourist people. A lot to walk and the result at the end.  Place for leisure along with family, freinds or even alone. Water is available at top. People use the path for jogging. Many random places for clicks. You can experince the inner side of mount royal if ready to travel into the woods (be safe)."
"The view from the ""mountain"" is spectacular. I'm from Utah and live in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, so a 600+ foot peak is more of a hill than a mountain. That being said, it's worth the trip.  You have to pass through the cemetery to get to the top, but it's one of those old, interesting cemeteries that invites you to read the headstones as you pass.

Once on top you can see nearly all of Montreal and the river. There's also an old art gallery with a gift shop and some paintings still there although most have been removed. For me it was a place to warm up after a cold walk.

Take the trip to the top, you won't be disappointed."
"Beautiful nature for do different things like camping, sports like cycling üöµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. And now in autumn üçÇ you will love the colours"
Loved the peace and quiet here in otherwise noisy Montreal. A green oasis in the heart of the city. Good views of the city from one of the multiple viewpoints. I imagine the canopy of trees would look really colourful in fall.
"Love to stop here whenever I'm in Montreal. Exceptionally beautiful at night. Drive up ( there is a walking path, but it's long and can be difficult for some) and have some hot chocolate)/iced coffee while enjoying the view. Is it worth it? Yes."
View of whole Montreal city is fabulous
"Great views of the city, lots of trails and nice paths to walk, not much else to say about it. It can get a little busy, so if you want a good picture I'd say to come in the morning, or at night. I haven't been at sunset, but I'd assume it's quite busy then as the pictures would be fantastic."
Lovely place to see the city from above.
"Really nice place to go with friends or family. The way up might be hard if you don't have a car, you either have to take the bus or walk. The view near the lake is amazing, you have a closer view of Montreal downtown. The people there are kind and respect the rules. The area is large so you can explore the Mount on your own. Great place for picnic. Recommended if you have a chance to go there."
Great hike up the hill behind McGill university. Beautiful view of Montreal city.
"One of the most incredible views I've ever seen in a city. It's totally worth the 45 minutes that it took me to get to the summit, but I went on winter and apparently it was one of the coldest, so many paths were closed. In normal conditions it should be easier. I'm definitely coming back in summer."
It looks good when we visit with your friends or family..Nice place to spent some quality time around there.
"Lovely hikes, wonderful energy and I feel safe to walk around on my own as a woman.  Beaver lake is gorgeous and lots of room to find a beautiful reading nook and have incredible views.  Also lots of picnic tables and easy to bring kids"
"Best view
Clean air
Quiet and relaxing"
Great staff and the juiciest crunchier chicken in Montreal!
"A lovely park with a fairly moderate climb to the summit for a breathtaking panoramic view. At the top there's are toilets and cafe, though it was closed when I visited.

Not far from the viewing point there is the cross that lights up in the evening.

Would recommend to come here to get away from the bustling city and for a great view at the top."
Busy park with fantastic view! Very much worth the hike up and the trails are well maintained.
Rental of snowshoes simple and fast! Took us 1h to do the 3km with 9 year old.
"Always beautiful.
Right in the middle of Montreal.
A peaceful place to walk, run, go for a bicycle ride.
A perfect place for the family or a cute date.
Lots and lots of space to enjoy the fresh air."
"The best park in Montreal, if only people would stop littering..."
"Definitely worth the ""hike"".

Let's be honest. It's less of a mountain and more of a large hill, but the sights it provides is absolutely amazing.

Go during the weekday evenings so you can see the twinkling lights of downtown.

There are washrooms BEHIND the large building - you have to go down a few steps.

If you walk along the path, you can walk past the observation deck, and into a large open grass field - perfect for groups or couples who want peace and quiet."
"Mont Royal is absolutely amazing! I was recently here in February and there were hundreds of people out running, walking, skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, biking and more! in the summer there are THOUSANDS enjoying just as many outdoor activities as well as all the amazing festivals.  Enjoy views over the entire city and across the river! the views are amazing,"
"Great place to go for fresh air, jogging and beautiful scenery."
"Nice park to relax and see the whole city.

In the winter months, there are great attractions like skiing and snow tubing which are $10 an hour which is a great price.

They were open in the lockdown so it was nice to go somewhere during Covid-19."
More comfortable on the other side of Park ave
"This is a beautiful place, DiscoverMyBusiness want to thanks everyone to handle such a good job to clean this park."
"So spacious and serene and lovely. People were cross-country skiing, hiking, tobogganing, skating all with tons os space to socially distanced and feel secure, no matter what your beliefs or politics. üî•‚≠ê‚ù§"
"Very nice view from the top and there are not many people. It‚Äôs very relaxing and it only takes about 15 minutes to get to the top. It‚Äôs good for running and for biking, because there is a road that goes around the mountain. At the top there is a very nice chalet where you can sit down and there are fountains for drinking and bathrooms."
"Great place to go for a run, especially in the fall, the trees are such a beautiful colour! The only thing is that the walk up the mountain can get pretty busy on sunny, warmer days. Would recommend going earlier in the morning or before dinner to avoid traffic and so that you can get a better view at the top!"
"I've heard so much about Mount Royal Park, that my expectations of it had skyrocketed...so I was slightly disappointed when we got there only to find it was a normal park. The hiking trails are gorgeous (but nothing extraordinary about them). The view from the top of the mountain was absolutely breathtaking, hence why I gave them a 4 star. So overall, if you're visiting Montreal for the first time, I would definitely recommend this place."
"I too these photos while both enjoying some very nice Montreal scenic spots and doing a Geocache lab Adventure. If you like scavenger hunts this might be a new thing for you. Check out Geocaching.com to see what it is!  Fun, excercise ."
Love this place and visit this regularly
"Big park with many hiking paths, once in the you won't even feel like you're in the middle of a big city and once in the top, the view is incredible. This is a must go for anyone visiting Montreal. The Belvedere has all the information needed and a cafe where you can chill and refill your energy after hiking. It also has bathrooms and the most amazing view of the city. It can be busy during weekends but it's very nice to go on week days and have a calm nice stroll."
"Best view ever for Montr√©al Downtown, recommended for newcomers"
"Spectacular place to go to see the city of Montreal from the top of the mountain.
I recommend doing the ascent route on foot or by bike, for the adventurous. So you can test your physical resistance.
There are also public buses that transport it."
"Situated on The Hart of Montreal the view is spectacular. Great place to walk, run or bike safe for kids. And a lot of parking (pay)"
We love Mont Royal!!! It's our second time here and this time we brought our little one. This is a beautiful place. You can rent a paddle boat and go around the lake. It's very relaxing and enjoyable on a sunny day!
"Whether you are local, on vacation or passing by stop by Mount Royal park  with amazing views of the city!"
"Awesome, I really l‚ù§ve the place, even my dog is enjoying when we are there üëçüëç‚ù§"
"Very stunning, like always it's a place to enjoy a good walk. Montreal at its best."
One of the best places in Montr√©al for relaxing and enjoying barbecue
Clean! Delicious snacks and beverages. Beutiful sights!!
"This place is awesome!  As you can see I was here in the winter.  So many great walking trails, great view over the city near the summit.  Lots of people use this, skiing, mountain bike riding, joggers, walkers, sledding, such a great place.  Despite the snow, trails are well maintained.  Very safe to walk around... I went up here at 3am one morning (couldn't sleep jet lag), I did take a torch but didn't need it as the lights from McGill University and the hospital shone up this way, so was able to see the trail no problems.  Near the top there is some more lights (where communication tower is) and against the white snow I didn‚Äôt need my torch.  Not sure how it goes during summer.  I went up this hill many times during my stay,  ice skating rink, the stone art, the cross at top, plus the awesome view of the city, so many things in this area so close to the city.  Need to take care if you going up the stairs, very icy, very steep, I preferred to go via the wide trail that winds its way up the hill, as much as the stairs are a great heart burner and good for getting heart rate up, too slippery and had a close call, so the slow burn up the trail incline was for me.  Well worth the effort."
"Lovely place to go picnic, hike, relax and anything that nature related. Lovely place to go spend a sunny day either with friends or your family."
"WINTER ACTIVITIES - plenty of Covid friendly activities to do here. Skating, tobogganing, walking/hiking, and cross country skiing. Kilometres of well-packed snowy trails and paths, uncleared in the winter can be icy, at times: requires you to slow down or use icers for extra traction. Clean indoor, heated washrooms available."
Indeed a Royal mountain ‚õ∞... Beautiful scene of downtown and you can see the sunset üåá.
Very nice park to walk around. I didn't have a lot of time to take in the whole park but the pond is very calming. So pretty once dusk rolls around. Would be great to pack a picnic and just chill on the grass.
"I believe this place to be the best spot for an overview of Downtown Montreal! You'll be mesmerized by the view! Just Amazing! Definitely worth the hike! If just visiting the city, you CAN'T leave without going there!"
"4 tubing lanes in the winter that you can do rentals from. Only down side is there isn't any to bring you up the hill so you do have to walk it yourself after each slide. Lots of other outdoor activities to do like skating, snow shoeing and cross country skiing."
"Super beautiful sight but do not recommend the cafeteria in the chalet, the serv8ce was slow and my cappuccino lacked flavor."
Fantastic views of the city on a clear day. The walk up to the top is aided by stairs but some may find it strenuous. Refreshments and toilets available at the summit to enjoy whilst taking in the spectacular views.
There‚Äôs no need to put more words! Just love this place since the first day I came to Montr√©al!
Great way to get outside and enjoy in any season
Great place beautiful view.üòÄ
"Beautiful place. Gorgeous views, pleasant for walking, running, having a picnic and walking your dog. Stairs to go down/up make it super accessible. A must-see in Montreal!"
A must see when in Montreal IMHO! Had a cloudy day and it was still a beautiful view of the city! Only explored a small portion of the park and its really nice!  Wide walkways and beautiful scenery.
"Very good park. Especially for biking, jogging enjoying in nature. Spring and summer is the best choice to spend a day. And view to the city is amazing."
"Cardio!
Ok, not all the time. Sometimes you just want to relax and spread out.
Spots for chilling with a picnic, taking a leisurely stroll, cycling, jogging, step cardio, skating, catching up on some z's in the sun or just getting from Cote des Neiges to downtown.
Enjoy this park that was originally designed by the architect of New York's Central Park."
"Always amazing!! Many beautiful trails to walk, jog or/and cross-country ski."
"Nice little in the city hike, lots of picnic areas along the way to the top!"
"My favourite place in the city . You have the whole view of the city,with tourists and people of all backgrounds intermingling together . It is also very easy to walk from Mount Royal chalet to the newly renovated Beaver Lake. Best place to take a stroll, do some light exercise and relax. Also great place for families !"
"Great for walking, jogging and biking during the summer. Lots of off route paths and main paths. Don't go late if you do not enjoy walking in the pitch black. No lights on certain paths."
After the chairs and desks on site the place became more perfect day and night. people visit the place early morning than before to take breakfast on site.
It's a great place to have a panoramic view of the city. In Spring must be better
Amazing view from the top üòç
"Always a great place to visit, even  in the muddy messiness of spring."
"I wish we had parks as beautiful as this back home. There's lots to do, and an amazing view at the top of a medium-difficult hike. It took us about an hour to get to the top, but it's not so bad if you grab a bit to eat or drink in their Cafe before you head up. It's definitely worth it. The walk down took half as long."
"Awesome skyline view. Went once and came back again at night, worth it both times as parking is quite cheap. $3.50 for an hour."
"This place was GORGEOUS during sunset.

It was a hike to get there by foot instead of driving. It was worth it in the end.

The place was packed full of people like myself, tourist.

But when you leave at night, be very careful since it gets dark very fast as you are walking around all the tall trees.

It was quite a hike for my family since my husband and I had our two young sons with us, one is 7 and the other is 1."
"Large number of trails and a good hike up the side of the mount. Classic design by Olmsted. If you are walking up from McGill, for this year, better to avoid the Peel Street entrance with all the construction."
It‚Äôs definitely a good place that worth‚Äôs your visits many times during the year. Good for exercising or a self time reading a book or with family or friends. Great place!
"The park is well worth a visit, has an abundance of natural beauty, some of which are truly breathtaking. The amenities are pretty organized and well thought out. But if you're planning to visit the place with family, by all means avoid going there on the weekends. No matter what time of the day you choose on a weekend, you'll find the park cramped with visitors, which is certainly not something you want to see in a nature park. And if you're driving, lo and behold! You'll find yourself playing some sort of a musical chair game with other drivers in the parking area. Not to mention that the parking is ridiculously expensive."
"If you are in Montr√©al, Mount Royal Park is a must. If you like long walks with the girl of your dream or looking for a place to do your morning run. This is the place. And if you can, go to the chalet there's the best view. And i personally thing it is even better at night."
Mount Royal has always something to offer even in the middle of brutal winter to the heart of hot summer. In my opinion cross country ski is the best of all activities you can do. Cheerful faces are real mood changer and beautiful vista points on top of the mountain are attracting all the time. This park is the immortal key characteristic of Montreal.
This morning was a perfect pre winter day to be at Beaver lake. The sun made an appearance and the wind was mild. It was a good start to the weekend.
Beautiful Place... Love it
"As someone who‚Äôs constantly downtown and living the city life, I love going to Mount Royal for a hike and a quick get away from stress and noise. It‚Äôs a pretty clean park with lots of nice trails and greenery and I simply love sitting at the lookouts and viewing the city from afar. The lookout can get crowded on peak time like during summer but early mornings are so nice to take a moment and to go on a hike on the smaller trails. Love relaxing there with a good book, one of my favourite spots ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù."
I had a nice walk around mount royal  it was pleasant their were a few people tobogganing.
"Always a beautiful place after a snow fall, the buzz of Montreal being alive was certainly felt by all the folks out enjoying the hill and snow with covid stopping folks from meeting in their homes."
"Took a little night tour @ Beaver lake on Mont Royal, the renovations look great! Great place to visit year round but especially fun to come skating in the winter!"
My only issue was walking up to the top.. poor signage and no clear path unless you take the 11 bus. Wonderful views though.  Don't miss the lake!
Great view of the city for just the price of parking. Highly recommend. Also great paths and places to hang out. Could easily spend a whole day here. Daily maximum for parking is $12. Hourly rate is $3.25.
Makes for a lovely stroll in a beautiful natural setting while in the heart of the big city...not to be missed if you need to relax a minute away from all hustle and bustle
Nice walks.  Quite relaxing bit also nice for sports.
This is just a perfect place for all Season. I love visiting this place every time I have a time to. I wish they could improve the lake though as it seems to be dirty and not properly maintained
Beautiful park!!! It‚Äôs awesome for running and for riding bikes.
"It is one of the best places in the Montreal that one must visit. You will find the best environment over there, and the best night look of the city at evening or night. If one visits this place in day,  one can see the best day-view of the Montreal. One can find the glimpse of tallest building of Montreal and assembly too."
Quite a bit of people on the weekend but it's worth the view. The park is beautiful and well taken care of.
"This park is big and beautiful. There are a lot of different paths and places to see. You can find a beautiful view of Montreal and a lake, this is perfect for a picnic with family and friends (if the weather permits). Also there is some drinking fountains in the way.
In the fall the trees are red and orange, it's very beautiful. Also you can find a lot of squirrels, seagulls and mushrooms in the forest. I recommend üòÑ"
It is great to enjoy a sunny day with kids. But keep in mind that parking could turn your mood down :)
"It is a beautiful place amidst the city but still further away from the downtown. I wouldn't have guessed such a place existed in the middle of Montreal !! It's serene and amazing to be there. The lake is beautiful and one can spend the entire day just looking around and not get bored of it...

But I just missed my dog... He would have loved it entirely and gone crazy in the entire area... But I missed him anyway üòä"
"Beautiful place, easily  accessable in the center of the city. I'd bring some change if you plan on parking the car in one of the lots. The pay machines there have problems reading cards and it could really turn your visit into a frustrating experience. Have fun. :)"
"Walk, run, xcountry ski, bike, hike, skate, snowshoe... possibilities endless. Plus the stairs are a great cardio workout. Views, sightlines spectacular."
"Noce place to espace the town near the town! Crosscountry skying, walking and iceskate are so nice in winter! The view is beautiful."
It's a nice relaxing walk up. Amazing view of the city.
"Amazing views, great place to finish your walk in the woods :)"
Very nice place for who would like to enjoy the scene of Montreal. Car park is available and washroom as well.
Gorgeous area lots of room for people to move around during Covid. Honestly I wish I lived in Montreal just to come here everyday.
Always a mind changer and amazing place to walk and connect with nature . üòä
"It‚Äôs a great place especially when visiting Montreal. A little bit of a hike but it‚Äôs worth because you‚Äôll see a great view of Montreal. I like how they have the historical learning spot where you can actually have a glimpse of Montreal‚Äôs history. Also, there‚Äôs a cafe so just in case you forgot to bring your coffee or snacks. I would definitely go back and visit this place everytime I visit Montreal. üíØ"
There were hundreds of stairs to get to the top from peel street it was clean. People were chilling with the barbecue around the lake. the most peaceful scenery evern seen in Montreal.
"This place has without a doubt the best view of downtown Montr√©al. Besides that, you can learn of the city's history and enjoy a hot chocolate by the warmth of a cozy fireplace during winter."
"Beautiful park and pathway.
Worth a visit"
"Fantastic place to visit in Montreal. Scenic views, astonishingly beautiful. Loved it, mainly when it's fall.

Be patient though. It's usually crowded. Avoid driving there. Use the transit, which is fast and you will be able to enjoy more all the views along the way."
"The park is beautiful with a ton of trails of various difficulties. You can meander up the mountain on the main trail, take the stairs, or take any of the paths through the dense woods. You forget you're in the city and it has great views from any path. There's a neat horse watering station thats near the top, its a good place to take a break for lunch!

Please. Please, clean up after yourself. Some folks leave trash and it ruins the experience for everyone."
"Always nice to go there, but now for sledding or skating is hard long lines and approx 45 minutes wait."
"What a wonderful area.  Designed by the creator of Central Park in Manhattan, the layout captures the majesty of the mountain in a gentlemanly layout perfect for a stroll or afternoon hike.  If you visit check out the chalet-style observatory at the peak of the mountain for some incredible views of the Montreal Skyline."
Great place for relaxing and enjoying time with friends and family.
"What's not to love? Giant park within downtown reach, beautiful Belvedere spots, gorgeous setting in all seasons (yes, including winter!!!), Wildlife, sculptures, biking and hiking options, crosscountry skiing, snowshoeing, small museum, perfect picnic setting, classical music orchestras playing in the summer (check these activities out!!), Picture worthy views, well maintained park.... It's truly a must see for any tourist visiting the city and for any bored local. Go at sunrise or sunset with your SO for a special evening. :) Highly recommended."
It's always great to visit mont royal!! I love this place ‚ù§Ô∏è
Really fun way to get outside and do something in Montreal.  Would recommend to anyone visiting because you get a really nice view of the city.  Or if you live in the city definitely is a go to place for a run or to walk the dog.
"Wonderful Place to visit for the aesthetics, the beauty and all the health benefits of walking, including up and down so many steps. I never heard so many people breathing out load for going up the stairs. then you can take a good rest and get all the photos you want. the view is just breath taking. You can just get to any area of the park, by bus and just keep walking."
"Loved how we could skate toboggan, cross country ski, snowshoe so active and awesome üëåüèæ"
"Surely one of the best place to hang out, hike, ski, skate or whatsoever in Montreal. Just wonderful view on top."
"Amazing place!! A grate mix of a very beautiful an protected nature, art, innovations an architectures, where you can do also a very nice sport trainings. I love it!"
Best green park on the island!
All good memories are there.
"Beautiful Park with some great views! We went in the fall and the foliage was breathtaking. It was a gorgeous day so we weren't too hot or too cold. Definitely recommend doing even a short hike if you're visiting Montreal! We ended up being dropped off right near the viewpoint so our hike wasn't too long at all. You could do a steep long hike to the viewpoint, which I believe starts somewhere on Pike street."
Very nice spot to take pictures at the Sunrise
Beautiful place!!
"Very good place to skate, toboggan,  ski and walk. Great view from the top"
"Great park. It is so refreshing to have this kind of a place within the city. You can walk around, go for a picnic, play something, or hike to the top from the bottom of the hill. The park looks wonderful in fall."
"Came here after the rain, so the sky was still a bit cloudy so I couldn't really take good pictures. I wasn't sure which way I should go to see the best view, but this one wasn't pretty bad. I guess the gray sky made it less fun to see the whole city, but the pretty view still made me stop and stare for some time. Might've been better if I went there on a sunny day but oh well! Will definitely come back next time!"
"My favorite place in Montreal.
Perfect to relax and enjoy the view from the top. The hiking is a little bit difficult, is better to do it slowly.
I really like it when snow!"
"Very nice place overlooking the downtown Montreal. You can have a nice hike through the park. Enjoy the fresh air, the flowers, birds and trees. Of course don't forget to pay for your parking,  meter maids comes by often to check on unpaid parking. Then enjoy the evening looking at the skyline of Montreal under the stars."
"To have this beautiful park, mountain and trail system right in the middle of a major city-Montral"
"Visited for the Tam Tams, the vibe reminded me of the Grateful Dead shows."
This is my go-to place Everytime I feel any kinda of emotion. View of the city is mesmerizing all 4 seasons.
Really nice park with very wide trails! The view of downtown is great. Enough space for everyone during covid
Must see if you only have a day in Montreal! Easy walk for kids
"One of the high altitude Scenic place to roam around to see historical fort covering almost an entire view of the Montreal City, Like 10 mins walk from the parking station(nominal fees). Would be amazed to see the view and feel the fresh breeze......"
"Great place to spend the day with family.
Great open space with a coffee shop and a bit of food. There are picnic tables with space to ot a stove top bbq.
Paying isn't free but reasonable.
Great view of the park and of Montreal downtown with a short walk.
For those who like a more likes a challenge,  you can ride a bike up or hike up the mountain.
Have fun"
"Always beautiful all seasons. Lots of trails to enjoy nature within the city. Easy to avoid crowds, just make sure to get there early in the morning."
"Great place! It is an amazing urban park, the beaver pond is nice, the trails are well marked, and in good condition, and there is a good amount of people there, but definitely not overcrowded.
The walk to the observatory is relatively easy, especially if you park on the parking lot, it is about a ten minute walk to the observatory.
The view of the city is great, you can take amazing pictures, and there's a nice caf√©. A place you must visit in Montreal"
Favorite place for a morning workout
A really beautiful spot to relax and take a break from the city. Some really nice views of the city with trails and open areas to enjoy some nature. You haven‚Äôt visited Montreal until you‚Äôve been to Mount Royal
"As a visitor from the states I was so taken by the mass of multi cultural locals, young and old, able and challenged, every shape and size who made it to the plaza at the top and just hung out to enjoy being out- together.  We Americans could learn alot from you Quebecers."
Amazing area to spend a family day even during the winter.
Must visit place if you are going on a trip to Montreal. Been there twice and it‚Äôs been amazing both times. You will not get a better view of Montreal city from anywhere else. Sunset is the best time to go there.
It s a very beautiful park you can see the city from there u can walk for hours . I recommand it for people who love nature.
You can run for miles/kilom√®tres and still have more routes to discover!
Jaw dropping view of the city - especially at night with the twinkling lights. There is a small parking lot at the top if you drive. It‚Äôs about a 45 minute hike to the top. Lovey snowy or summer time.
Great scenic location for walks and enjoying the city views
Very nice place to walk in the summer
Gorgeous view and nice running trails!
Gorgeous Lookout of the city. Especially at night. Fastest way to get here is to go north on peel. Keep walking after the road ends and climb up the stairs
It's a very good park for walking.
"Good  sight.
Peaceful."
Cool we ad fun.
"Good place with family  friends , trekking , jogging"
If you want to skate be aware the wait time is kind of long but worth it.
Mont Royal during sunrise. It's beautiful. It's quiet. Go up about 30-45 minutes before the sunrise to watch the sky slowly brighten over the city.
One heck of a hike. Too many stairs. Not sure if there is a better way to reach the top. I took the peel st entrance. Pretty good view.  Grab an Ice cream and hike down as you deserve it.
Large walk paths and super clean. Good place for a walk or run and the sight over the city especially at night is much worth it. Just be aware that you need to pay for parking if you take your car up.
Such a nice view.
As a tourist you will love the views and the extensive paths. As well as a Montreal local you will love the hiking and the ability to find places away from crowds!
"Still, no decent direction to the place. Something should be done about finding it on gmaps. The belv√©d√®re was nice though."
"This was a highlight for our trip.  We went hiking on a brisk day through this area. It was so beautiful, well maintained and marked even with snowfall.  The expansive park is good for multiple activities.  We were walking and hiking but saw skiers and sleds too. We walked up to the cafe, which was a pleasant surprise! The poutine was some of the best we had while vacationing in Canada.  They had good service and many food options. Beautiful area to visit.  Moderate to not strenuous."
We must have missed the crowd. It was a bit cool out but a lovely spot to rest and relax. It was very peaceful without the crowd that we heard is usually there. The service desk guy was very informative and friendly.
"A great place to spend a couple hours hiking in the woods but also get a great view of the city.  A very peaceful place after the bustle of the city.

If you‚Äôre a tourist (as I was) I‚Äôd recommend you take bus 11 up to the top of the hill to get out and look around but then take bus 711 down so you can stop at St. Joseph‚Äôs Oratory.  üòä"
It's nice butbasontreals most famous park many improvements can be made. 1) Install many many more garbage and recycling cans 2) pave the main trail leading up and down 3) more lights for night 4) invest in more benches just about everywhere 5) Have more staff to clean up garbage
"Looking for a little paradise to chill out and hang your hammock on weekdays or to dance to the sound of drums at the Tam Tams on Sunday afternoon?  Look no further, Mont-Royal Park is the place to hangout, walk, climb or even cycle to the top and enjoy the most beautiful view of Montreal."
Amazing view of downtown Montreal
"Very nice place to go for a walk. There are many trails, a lake and lookout points where you can see the city! Also the beautiful fall colours are great this time of year!"
Beautiful place and more advanture activities in winter
"Great for picnic, dogs allowed on leash, great views, public restrooms, and small easy hikes."
"One of the largest park situated in the heart of the great Montreal city. There are many out-standing landscapes. Great for walking, jogging, running, and bikong! Give it a try and you'll see what I mean!"
"It's nothing short of majestic. Definitely recommend it. Few key things to note:

-Getting in and out of the mountain can take time as there is construction going on (as of August 2019)
-Parking can be tight on weekends and evenings also there is a fee to park with a $11 max rate
-Bring your own snacks as the food place on the viewing platform is sub-par
-The sunset is breathtaking"
Great place to relax and barbecue
A hilly park with lots of trees and trails. I prefer leaving the paved path and making my way through the forest paths.
"One of the best place to visit in Montreal. If you are visitors in Montreal, then one must vist this place at evening or in morning.

From this place you can see the beautiful view of the city, and at night it you can view amazing city lights."
"Mont Royal is beautiful but you have to find the right places to see the best views! The busy, tourist places can be a bit disappointing but if you follow some of the nature trails you will stumble upon some really cute lookouts!"
"Amazing park right in the middle of the city. Worth it to take a walk, specially with you go to the top of the park for city view. Good structure with bathrooms at the top."
"Beautiful. Parking is a bit far. The view point shows the beautiful skyline of Montreal. The park around it is gorgeous for walking around, biking, picnic etc. They have  a coffee shop, a museum and a restaurant nearby."
Lovely place and well worth visiting in Montreal! Lovely uphill walk to great views with gorgeous fall colours! Would highly recommend. There is also a nice coffee shop near the top with nice views for a quick rest!
"A must if you are visiting Montreal, amazing views of the city, hiking, lake and much more! Great spot for picnics, BBQs. Park for kids and benches to sit down."
"Beautiful recreational location within the city. There are a couple of activities for every age you can do during the winter season like cross country skiing, ice skating, sledging and more. Equipment can be rented on site. There is also a cafe that has hot and cold beverages."
"Beautiful place all year round. Autumn leafs are definitely beautiful. Summer time picnic is great. And winter time, you see kids on sleighs and adults enjoying cross country skiing. Definitely the heart of the city."
"Walked up from the old town (~1hr) to Mount Royal Park.
Was Autumn, so not as beautiful as Spring I guess.
Nevertheless, enjoyed the tour in the Park.
Saw squirrels, Raccoons, Woodpeckers."
An oasis of nature in the middle of the city. A beautiful drive.
"Nice view, relaxing!"
"Anytime of the year, this area of Montreal is a real delight."
"Must to visit if you are in Montreal! Perfect view on the downtown, pretty stair at the top, but its not easy to reach it. Dont give up and you can! Great park on route toward here. Its first place i visited in Montreal"
Great views of the city. I don't recommend walking up from the north through the cemetery when it's icy especially if you don't have the proper footwear. Crampons or boots with treads recommended.
Such stunning views over the whole city. Recommend visiting at sunset. The last of the sun's light is beautiful to watch as it disappears behind the buildings. Very easy to get there using the metro and number 11 bus which takes you straight up the mountain to the top. There are also some walk ways and a lovely interpretation centre with washrooms on site.
Lush green scene in the heart of an urban city - gotta love it! Perfect view of the city and tons of cycling routes around.
"My favorite part of Montreal. It's a beautiful loop if you start from downtown hotels (up peel st.), Hit the viewpoint (follow the stairs), then head east (gradual paths down). Pick a nice restaurant on st. Laurent, then head back south and west to your hotel. Even nice in cooler weather."
"It's awesome, but I found it difficult at first to reach  and find a parking space, but it's well worth the trouble"
"I was really surprised with all the things they have added to the park, it looks pretty noce and as clean as always a very good place to bring people for the first time they know montreal, but a very good place to enjoy the view of the city too"
Nice park with beautiful mountain top view of Montreal.
This place is magical. The taste of nature in the heart of our beautiful city.
Wonderfull all seasons
Beautiful and most stunning place to visit in Montreal. On a clear sunny day you can see all of downtown. Walking distance to view point is not too bad. I would reccomend visiting this place during the week.
"Must visit! There are many trails, for walking and biking. There's a really nice lake, plenty of space around to relax and enjoy nature."
"Great view on the city üëç perfect for biking, hiking and walk with family and friends. Fresh air and beautiful scenery üòçüåûüëå. Chateau Mount Royal is  one of the must seen places in Montreal."
Amazing park with amazing view of Montreal city.
It was an enjoyable afternoon hike.
"It‚Äôs a nice place to visit where you can do something else other that walking around and exercise. This small museum is a pretty idea and have a gift store, restaurant and washrooms."
"It's beautiful;it's free and when it's dark with all the lights, it feels like a Fairy tale. One thing, there's about a million steps and stairs that you have to climb. So  be prepared for hiking..))"
"Beautiful climb up the top. Moderate effort required. Great that you can vary the number of ways you can climb up or down: walk up a paved incline, hike through woods, or climb stairs. Once you get to the top, a breathtaking view of Montreal is right below."
Big beautiful park.  There are plenty of hiking paths leading to scenic views of Montreal.   You can also drive and ride your bike throughout the park.  There is also a city transit bus that has pickup and drop-off spots throughout.    There is also a rest area with restrooms near the lake.  The lake is small but cute and is filled with gold fish.   There is plenty of picnic areas throughout the park as well.   The park is big but walkable.   There is a water fountain in the rest area but I'd recommend if hiking the park to bring water.   Plenty if fields for the dogs and kids to play .
"What else could I add, the park is big, well maintained and a great escape from the city without leaving it.

It's just awesome to be able to ride my longboard down this awesome hill on well maintained path or get inside the woods on foot the get the more paisible experience.

Best of both world, it‚Äôs like our Central Park in the middle of a bustling city, just not at the same level."
Best place in Montreal. Fabulous place to run :).
amzing place beautiful and closest place for hiking.
"Amazing view , for free! I recommend going at sun set and climbing up the stairs from peel street. But bring your drinks with you as no place to buy any at the top . Also, there are no lights at night when you are going down so prepare your phone's flashlight."
"This park offer alot of things . Well maintained garden with a big pond of water . Ducks . Clean washrooms with lockers.
Plenty of parking.
Easy access.
Nice walk
And bring something to spend whole day here.
U will enjoy the ice cream to."
Great place for a walk or hike
Great views.. once you get there.  Be prepared for a bit of a hike.. they have stairs though... so not too terribly rugged...
Great views! Well worth the stress of parking
"Beautiful views, tobogganing and skating in the winter, tamtams in the summer."
I love the serenity and view of this park. Lots of shades and trees.
Perfect place for family and friends. Good areas for picnic!
Always a great place to have a good walk.
One of the best park I've been to. Summer and Fall seasons are so wonderful that you would want to stay for longer
Awesome place to spend some time üëåüèªüëåüèª
Great place..if you are in Montr√©al you have to come here
Countryside within the city. My daughter loves the trail. Great for running and family fun.
"Great place to go for a walk, any season !"
Nice amazing place ..lot of trails and stairs for walk and workout.
Went for a run in the evening. The track to the summit gives a mild but consistent incline and there is roughly 300 steps at the top. Views are awesome and the crowd is active.
"Gorgeous hike and excellent views of the city from the viewing platform and from the steps of the visitor center.

There were no tours when we went up, but the woman giving advice and guidance was very knowledgeable about the history and current day information of the building and the park.

Heaps of stairs so if you're not in reasonable physical condition you will want to take it slow."
"What a great place to spend the day! Beautiful.sights, interesting people and a great place to exercise and get some photos!"
"Today was a beautiful day to walk in the woods on the mountain. Not as crowded as on the main roads, but lovely in the golden light reflected from the trees."
Peaceful away from the city noise
"Great views over the city with lots of open space, a short walk from the parking lot, but it's a fairly easy walk. Can get crowded on nice days"
This place has some breathtaking views of the city of Montreal. The best part was the hiking in order to get to the top but it can be a little strenuous. There are no food trucks on the top except for water. Worth visiting when in Montreal...
It's usually pretty crowded but with the pandemic measures it is a lot more since must be one of the last legal and safe things to do in the city. Some winter activities were closed.
Had a wonderful time here with my wife tubing. Awesome. Very big park with activities to keep you entertained and there's even a cafe.
Great place to exercise and relax....
Perfect place for family picnic. Lots of open space to play for kids. Beautiful pond!
Any Season is beautiful on Mount Royal. Not to be missed when visiting Montreal
A great walk on the hill over the city. Great lookout point! Many photo opportunities.
"Absolutely breath taking views. At the top of the stair climb, there is a massive ‚Äúhall‚Äù with a cafe for refreshments and a gift shop. Stairs are a challenge but the views are well worth the effort."
A nice experience and amazing view of downtown Montreal.
"When you drive into mount royal park at night, it takes you about ten minutes to reach the parking lot at the top, where you can see the whole Montreal city at night. I went there last Christmas, and when I went up there, I remember a little raccoon going through the trash can for food, But there was a warning sign on the parking area that said no feed raccoons, so we didn't feed it, we just watched it. and my friend said that on summer nights, raccoons would come out for food or a walk and she told me that every night the Jews from the church would come here to see the scenery and have a chat. When i saw them that time, i felt life is easy."
"Beautiful place and very extraordinary view of Montreal city. There's two coffee shops, however I wouldn't recommend bith of them (cold untasty coffee and small selection of edibles, plus pricy). There are also hiking paths and cycling routes. In addition, huge area for picnics with nice views and space for kids to run and play."
Very nice and clean in Summer
"Such a beautiful place to visit for refreshment and fun. Wonderful view for Montreal people and for tourists f'course. You can see the whole city from this mountain. Night views are really awesome, love to go there everyday if possible, atleast if you have some company, it would be really an exciting place to go."
"Amazing place in the middle of Montreal.
At night you can spot fireflies."
"A very good place to see the whole of Montreal downtown. Different views for different seasons! During summer/autumn, lots of people on the grass and by the lake to enjoy the sun and wind. During winter, it turns into a winter wonderland!"
Really nice park on Mount Royal. Some call this area Beaver Lake. Park has gotten some huge upgrades recently.
"Avoid the main paths and you'll have a much better time, there's loads of smaller trails winding through here that allow you to get away from the crowds, they tend to be smaller and more natural as well. Unfortunately there's not many viewing points to get a photo over the city, so you'll have to elbow your way through to get a good snap"
"Spectacular view of Montreal. I highly recommend both the day and night view. The Chalet is a wonderful cozy place to rest, read, and get a snack. Great place to walk around and enjoy nature."
"I love to walk around here, it's beautiful üòç one of my favourite places to go and relax üòå"
"This park is an absolute gem. I especially enjoyed the hike up to the summit, where I enjoyed a view of the city. There were plenty of people when I visited, but even so, this park felt ""wild"" at times--very different compared to a place like Central Park in New York City. It was hilarious to see the same cyclists several times as I ascended and descended the park; I guess it must be a great place to go biking! Overall, I loved this park and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a scenic stroll away from the city."
"Superior view to see Downtown of Montreal.
The best place of all season."
"Amazing park with great view over Montreal city, also many activities available during winter"
The sleigh sliding is very fun.
The view from up there is breathtaking ! Especially during the sun down time. Make sure you have your camera because you definitely gonna need it ! Enjoy.
"Definitely a must visit when in Montreal,  the city gets its name from the mount royal park, panaromic views of the city and a pleasant park makes it worthwhile coming here"
A wonderful day.
Good view. Better have good boots when visiting during the winter. Paths can get slippery.
"Been there in winter. It's a very nice park, overlooking the city of Montreal. Always good for a little walk or a run."
As must go for anyone visiting Montreal. The park is the name giver of the city. It bursts a beautiful view over Montreal and is a great photo opportunity.
"A must, short walk from Lac des Castors to a breathtaking city view. Don't miss any time of year."
"One of the beautiful parks in Montreal and my favourite.
You get the amazing view that should every one appreciate
Very clean atmosphere
Various activities can be done here, running, skiing in winter, barbecue in summer, watching the  view , taking pictures .... Ext"
Excellent view of Montreal city. In summer use sunscreen and umbrella. The walk from parking is not long and has many trails that you can enjoy.
Beautiful view of the city. Also found friendly Racoons.
Best view of overall Montreal
One can get best view in night.
Beautiful place to walk and see a great view of the city.
"Beautiful walking trails, that are well maintained even in the winter time. Bring on some good boots though! Easily accessible from downtown if you wanna power through a whole lotta steps.

The main chalet on top has some beautiful rooms, amenities and art pieces; the craftsmanship on it is great for a building that's as old as this. I had a great time just walking around it for a while. The bathrooms in there might be useful!

You can enjoy Beaver Lake, Maison Smith, the giant Cross on top of Mount Royal and of course the lookout right by Chalet Mont-Royal. The cemeteries nearby are also really beautiful and make for a nice afternoon or even as a day activity if you like nature and hiking!

Would recommend 11/10"
"Hiking in Mont Royal was one of the things I enjoyed the most while visiting Montreal. This is a must-do! Well maintained trails, this is a relaxing walk, a huge green space - and a gorgeous view of the city once you reach the top."
Nice View of island of MTL
"Beautiful view of the City of Montreal. Must visit place; though, we had to climb 100s of stairs to get there."
"Lovely place, we were there in November, and so lucky that to see snow in November. Happy üòçüå®Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑ"
"Best spot to look through the beautiful view of the city! Be careful the ice on the road though, very slippery."
Nice place.. love to be there..
Great city view from the mountain. Really nice park to relax in the grass.
"Incredible place! To start with is a privilege to have a place like that in the middle of the city. There are plenty of grass to have a picnic at different points, and there is a big forest in which you will feel transported outside town within minutes.
You can see the east part of town from the Cafe suspendu. As you keep going up you can visit the cross, quite impressive, but no views from there.
From the chalet you can see the south part of the city, with the skyline. In the caf√© you can have drinks and snacks, and there is also a souvenir shop with nice quality items.
My favourite place is the lac aux castors. As you can see in the photos, is beautiful. You can perfectly picnic there or just spend the afternoon with a nice book. There is a small Cascade that bring up the place.
If you need to disconnect but you can't leave town, this is the perfect place for you to reconnect with nature."
"My boyfriend and I had visited Montreal bank in November. I fell in love with the city, in general, but Mont Royal is just plain amazing. We enjoyed walking throughout, visiting the chateau, and taking in the view. Definitely recommended when visiting!"
Amazing park for being in the middle of a city. Good trails for waking and even skiing and ice skating.
The view is worth the hike. Great vantage point to see the Montreal skyline.
Very beautiful place. You have to visit this park if you go to Montreal. It has many walking tracks. Very beautiful in autumn.
"Cool, but to many People for a Sunday walk"
"Tulips!! Tulips everywhere!!
Beautiful view, won't spoil it with picture folks!"
"I would suggest going during the day and at night. It's a beautiful park to walk, run or bike. We went to watch fireworks which weren't very visible from the peak due to trees but the city was a wonderful sight."
Oh wow... such a beautiful place. Best place to view whole montreal. We went at evening time and felt amaze by the view. Only issue at later evening was mosquitoes.. but otherwise we were happy to visit this place.
Visited recently in winter which is a totally different landscape than summer. The whole experience was like walking in a winter wonderland and I wish I brought skiis! People who did will have an easier time getting around though walking is fine in winter boots. The less popular paths didn't have snow paved so just be careful. Views are beautiful with snow on the trees and paths. Very calming visit.
Lots of areas for looking out over the Montreal skyline. Guide pictures to show landmarks. Roads paved and lots of room for biking and walking. Tourist centre closed but signage helpful.
"Amazing view of the city, nice place to chill and spend the day."
"I'm love with this historical place. I enjoyed a large view of Montreal, but just went until the Chalet area and there is a lot more to visit. I must come back soon!"
Best view of Montr√©al !
Well worth the climb! We went there in the winter so the stairs were quite slippery. But the view was incredible!
Canada is a must visit country and I enjoyed thoroughly visiting all the historical sights. The weather was beautiful with the right amount of snow in November.
"Absolutely, great place to see entire Montreal. I would recommend this park, many other nice monuments around the park. Just depends how far you are willing to walk."
Nice place and beautiful view of Montreal
Its a very nice and clean park. Lots to explore and amazing views of the city
"Beautiful park in the middle of Montreal. The overlook is stunning, trails well maintained, and ski/skate rental. The quality of ski trails was incredible. Beautiful, I want to go back in the summer!"
Really nice place to walk around and enjoy the outside
"I loved this huge park, make sure to follow the road when you go there to the the amazing beautiful view of Montreal from the top ! An awesome park for BBQs, kids and adults. There is also a small water park where kids can play & enjoy their time."
An absolutely incredible day at the park
"Absolutely Beautiful!

That's all I need to say.

Go See"
"A nice park, great for a run and quite hilly for you to feel like you deserve the view on the city. The beaver castor had no beavers but this was worth our afternoon just to chill in a bit of green."
"Great place for a walk, hike or just a spot to sit and have a coffee."
"This is the place to escape the city in the city.  Beaver Lake is one of Montreal's best parks to spend with the family or alone with a book.  Sunshine, birds, the rustle of the trees.  Great place to be"
"Beautiful Overlooking Montreal
Plenty of parking and washrooms are tidy!
Great way to spend time here!"
Beautiful landscape. Parking is hard to find but even harder to pay for. Please consider an option to pay for parking through an app.
What amazing park!!! Every person who visit Montreal must to go there.
Good to walk or jog. Worthwhile to climb to the nice-view-spot
"This is a beautiful place for a hike any time of the year. The view of the city is iconic. You don't have to be a pro to get to the top, there are many paths and staircases that her you to the top in as little as half and hour at a leisurely pace. You can also go longer and go up and down in two hours or so. It's my favourite place to escape the busy city life without having to drive out."
"Beautiful park with water and toilets at the chateau, piano at the square and dells on which to picnic, play and lay. Well done Montreal!"
"Get vacation.in touch with nature, and see Leonard Cohen from the lookout."
"If you are in Montreal and didn't visit this place yet, then something is wrong for sure. Fairly, number one park in Montreal with huge area and a lot to do. The lookout area is marvelous. You can see most of Montreal from it. Visiting the park while it's snowing has a special taste üòä"
"Amazing park, nice lake, waterfall, and a small playground. Perfect for family picnic. Bussing is conveniently located close to it."
"The walk was intense, the park has wood trails that go up and down the mountain for those that are adventures as i am.
Once you reach the area with the city you'll be blown away but how beautiful it was and still is.
They even have a piano where people can freely go and play it. And while i was their a few teenagers were playing a catchy and happy song together."
"Mount Royal park is a beautiful place.
You will not be disappointed.
Fabulous vista view from atop the mountain that overlooks the whole panoramic view of Montreal and the Saint Lawrence river.
You have seen all you care to see there is a nice restaurant down below that you can enjoy a sandwich and a drink and just relax.
It is great to see so many people in the park enjoying all the beautiful attributes and surroundings the park has to offer.
When in Montreal do not mess this destination.
Lots of memories and take lots of pictures it is a great place"
"As a montrealer, this is one of my favorite parks. A must for everyone"
Love being here. It's just so mesmerizing! The hike is great. The trials are wonderful. The sunset is great here. Gives the best view of the city. I wish they had some more food stalls there.
The best place to walk and see Montreal from the top
The park is very lovely. Lots of picnic benches and places to set down a mat and sit in the grass. The washroom facility is still open with designated male and female entrance!
"If you want a great nature walk in the middle of the city, this is it! Especially in this time of COVID."
Had a great walk with beautiful weather. Lots of people at the chalet look out over Montreal. Really enjoyed our walk in the park.
"What an amazing view from here. You can see all of the city that is gorgeous. To reach the top is simple because there are the stairs close to the chalet, but if you like walking in the woods, there is a very nice path where you can see a lot of beautiful squirrels."
"Definitely worth the drive or the hike. Great, sweeping views of the city."
It‚Äôs really crowded on the weekends tho
"It's really beautiful part.
I advise to visit,  just bring your beer with you üòâ.
You can do BBQ
You can't fish there so don't get your rod with you."
Lovely hike. Don't cheat and drive up. Experience of meandering through a Forrest and reaching the top is great!
"Beautiful urban park. Lots of space to roam. Lovely landscaping, architecture, and art."
"Wonderful place to hike, whether taking the winding roads or going straight up the stairs. Wonderful view from the park above, and a little more walking will get you to the cross, which looks much bigger up close than from the city below!"
It's the best please in montreal for taking a walk and biking.
"It's Mount Royal.....
If anything it's MORE than 5 stars...
What, is nature not living up to your standards?"
Stunning skyline views. Great park in the middle of the city. Definitely worth the stop.
"For summer bar-b-q parties, its good"
"My Favorite place in Montreal. You can run, jog, hide and seek, do picnics, skate, play sports, hike, camp, and all  the fun outdoorsy stuff and forget that you're right in the heart of the city."
"Amazing Park! If you're in Montreal for a short period and need to choose 1 park, choose this one!
Have a beautiful view of the city, even with a bad weather is incredible to see Montreal from the top of the Mount Royal Park!
There's a lot is stairs, so be prepared to climb! Will worth it!"
Impressive views during winter. The walk all the way up is definitely worth it. A bit slippery in some places but with proper snow boots you should be fine.
"Beautiful place at the peripheral exit of Mont-Royal. In the summer and the fall, it's a lake with ducks, fish and all sorts of birds around and in the winter, it freezes over making it ideal for skating. Also has a cozy restaurant for a quick snack/meal. You can rent skates and skiing equipment in the winter and bring barbeque or picnic blankets in the summer to enjoy with family and friends. One of the best places to hang out in, in Montreal. Highly recommend it!"
We love to walk here..nice scenery and fresh air
Beautiful üèûÔ∏è
"Great experience, must do I went there in winter time totally fun tracking. City View from Chalet is worth it. Beautiful scenic Montreal in summation"
Breathtaking scenic views of Montreal! It is a bit of a trek getting up there but totally worth it! It has great hiking trails and bike paths! It even has a little shop at the top of the mountain and vending machines to buy drinks as well as washrooms! Plan to spend a few hours walking around.
"Are you planning to visit Montreal? Going to Mount Royal should be on your places-to-visit list. After walking/hiking all the way to the top, you'll be rewarded with this stunning view of Montreal and greather area. As a local, I love going there. Best place to be with mother nature and escape from your daily little life and city noise. Be prepared to do a little cardio if you use the stairs. There are many.üò•üòé"
"Very nice park to take a walk. There is a couple of large stairs, so if you are not used to exercise take it easy. The view of Montreal from the top totally worth it"
"Lovely place to hangout, may be crowded when the weather is lovely though"
"Such peaceful park. I love this park
I can go for a picnic
I can ride my bike there
I can also play lots of games. Its very nice you should check it out"
Great place to get fresh air
Beautiful park. Perfect location for a picnic on a sunny weekend with friends and relatives
"Good view of downtown Montreal, nice little stroll up the path, there's a building that has a little bistro and a bathroom. There are other paths for more strolls once up there. Only down side is gotta pay for parking if you came by car and it ain't cheap."
Classic view of the city .We went on a rainy day it was good but If you go on a sunny day you will love it .
Amazing city view from mount royal and best place to spend time for roaming!
"This is Montreal's central park. It's large, beautiful, and has many paved and dirt trails. You'll quickly forget that your in the middle of a busy city. The lake has rowboats for rent. Climb to the Chalet at the top of the hill for one of the best views of downtown Montreal and highest point in Montreal."
Great views of the city from the very clean viewing area!
"If u wanna runaway from city life for sometime, climb up Mont Royal and see the view of Montreal from an elevation with the st.lawrence quietly flowing in the background, the illuminated bridges.....yes this is the best hideout place in Montreal"
Awesome view. Could have some lights for the stairs.
Amazing walk. Squirrels everywhere. Little birds on all the feeders. Gorgeous views all around. Lots of joggers around but plenty of space for just walkers or even skiers in the snow. Great place to kill a few hours and just wander around while forgetting everything for a while :)
Great variety of scenic hiking trails for all ability levels with a beautiful view and chalet at the top!
The best place to overall montreal city
"The sliding aisles are dangerous,hard,
The park itself is great"

"Deserves a good few hours to chill around the park, if you are an early bird make it there for the sunrise, wish I had done that."
Very beautiful but crowded
Amazing park with an Amazing view ..!! A must visit..
Beautiful views of Montreal from the top. It is very close to the city (within walking distance) so it is easy to get to. The walk to the top is not steep so it is a very pleasant experience.
So many trails and great views on this beautiful mont Royal. right in the beautiful city of Montreal. Great experience for the whole family including fur babies.
"Great site to visit, lots of history and excellent view of the city."
"Beautiful park. Nice playground for the kids, lots of room to play and run around. Small lake with row boat rentals to amuse the kids"
This is a lovely location to watch the sunrise. We are from Europe and woke up early due to the time difference anywayüòÅ. Great view!
Wow!!! Its really a super place to spend ur time with family. U can plan for one day picnic too. Good place for kids to enjoy after the winter. There is view point where u can see the whole downtown city. Big Play area for kids.
"It's a great haven of peace in the middle of Montreal, just a quick walk away from downtown. The ""mountain"" is not tall, but it's still a bit of a climb of you're walking the whole way. Stairs and paths are mainly in very good condition, though!

Parking is a bit expensive and the chalet at the top is not very good - but the park is great for a picnic!"
Amazing park to go for a run. Lots of space and beautiful scenery
The whole vibe of Montreal is majestic but Mount Royal is the pearl of Montreal. The view gives you that feeling that It's city of Love.
Nice hike. Awesome autumn colors. The stairs are not for the weak!
"I would give a five star but the think of locking the street during the summer was the worse idea I never seen!

#letsguide"
"Cant go wrong in this park. Walking, hiking, sitting on thee grass. There are trails, the lake, piknik tables to BBQ. its all great!"

Wonderful place in autumn
"Just gorgeous! Must visit if you are in Montreal! Beautiful places to walk, great views, ample parking."
"Very nice place, if you come to Montreal you have to visit this place, fun fact the beaver lake doesnt have beavers."
Too many visitors. Very few wearing mask and walking with no distance. No a place to go at this time of pand√©mia
"Beautiful park! Fun to go biking, a walk, picnic, run or relax take pictures...there is something for everyone! Go and enjoy!"
"So busy! But so much to see and do. The trails are awesome and everywhere, or just make your own, like some people do. Last one up the mountain's a loser!

The chalet at the top has magnificent architecture, and the view over Montreal takes the breath away, everytime."
Nice place to visit with family
Beautiful and clean place to get an overview of the entire city. Luscious and green walk through the park with lots of people. Definitely worth going here to see the general appearance of Montreal!
"Breathtaking views of our beloved city of Montreal.
Great for walking and jogging!"
"Going out ti the top and to see a beautiful site of the city was well worth the journey. For any visitor, this is a place to go."
"Too busy. People litter, cigarette buds and beer bottles are in sight as soon as you find a nice place to chill. What a shame. Montreal city itself is filled with cigarette buds. Please change and be more responsible and respectful to mother nature."
With everything shut down it's nice to take a little walk here
Too icey but beautiful landscapes and scenery of downtown up 9n the belvederes
"Beautiful place to come, especially in mid fall when all the leaves are changing."
Lots of different paths to follow and beautiful sights. Its ideal to go and for a walk or jog.
Beautiful natural space. Make sure to enjoy the tam tams every Sunday in the park
Nice lookout we enjoyed it but  lots of stair steps
"Amazing piece of nature in the center of Montr√©al. You can reach the top by climbing the hundreds of stairs or by taking a bus, so it's very accessible. Views of the city in it's entirety! A must see!"
Beautiful lookout of the city accessible from so many different points of the city. Huge park space with lots of walking trails throughout.
Loved the winter activities. Fun! Fun!! Fun!!!
So beautiful üòç
The locals are very proud of this place and they should be. Very good hiking trails. They even have their own mounted police for the park.
"A beautiful place in which I can see the beauty of downtown of the montreal. Also, so many trees are there in which a person can feel himself/herself close to nature."
Mount Royal Park is amazing spot to view the landscape of the city of Montreal and provides a great way to get some hiking in. You can also add some amazing pictures to a great adventure once you get to the top.
Good spot to spend time with friends
Amazing views. This is a must do.
"Like every mountain, the view is nice but it's tiering to get there. I wish mountains were a bit more flat sometimes."
Amazing place for BBQ and relaxing!
"A beautiful place to spend time with family, located in the heart of downtown Montreal. It is very peaceful and romantic, and a perfect place to enjoy the weather."
"Great trail for biking, hiking and site seeing. There's a lot of people trekking up the stairs with you so you'll get plenty of encouragement. The view up top is worth it."
"Very nice park, the parking lot is quite busy on the weekends. Nice place for gatherings with friends and family"
amazing  hike within the city specially for autumn colors
Amazing views of the whole city from Mont Royal and it clears our mind by having such a great view of our new world
Serene lake and lush greens. Small kids play area.
"Nature is so green, easy parking (+/- 3,50$/hour)...but the view of the downtown is breathtaking!"
"If you are visiting Montreal,  this is a must visit place, have a wonderful view of the city. Also, if you love hiking,  this little mountain have a lot of trails with a lot of vegetation and little animals"
The most famous park I know. This is like a monument!
Good place for short hiking and a great view of the city
"It's an Olmstead park, just like Central Park and Prospect Park in NYC.  I recommend going into one of the less traveled paths to feel like you are in a forest. Some of the paths have a a few stories worth of stairs so be prepared. Came here when on the hottest day or the year. There are not many water fountains so bring water if you are going to spend a lot of time was walking, which is ready to do."
"An absolute must-visit spot in Montr√©al. The view from Chalet du Mont Royal is amazingly beautiful...going there just before sunset would give one an opportunity to witness the aerial day view and the night view of the city. The best place to park the car is at 1196 voie Camillien-Houde. Parking rates are 0.25 cents/15 minutes or $3/hour or $11 whole day. If someone is spending more than 3.75 hours, it is better buy a full day parking fare."
Here we can a good view of Montreal. excellent view
Great park in the downtown Montreal!
Always have the good memories there.... my favorite place in the city
You have to drive up the road and park in a lot closest to the hill. It cost $3 for the hour. The gps sends you nearby but you have to go up the hill while driving. Ask a local for directions they can point it out. Awesome view nice workout.
"Very beautiful place ,someone should keep climbing to grab pictures for these hidden treasure like that Cross statue"
Great park and so many trails to explore. Well worth the time to visit.
"Calm , nature and beautiful place to visit with kids and family even good for pets , bicycle running and jogging"
It may be touristy of me but this really is a spectacular view of Montreal! Especially at night. Highly recommend you go at least once or twice.
"Visit there during the morning hours take a long hike that takes about 2/3 hours. At the summit you'll see a wonderful gamut view of the Montreal city.  First photo (attached). There's also a coffee shop, gift shops and restrooms."
Great spot to get a panoramic view of Montreal. Lots of nice married trails.
Absolutely stunning and very fun place to take a walk.
Enjoyed the hike to the top. The pay off of seeing the Montr√©al skyline was well worth it!
"Great views from the top on a beautifully clear day. It was worth the climb - we went up the route with lots of stairs, so it was also a decent workout."
Beautiful park with good views. Lots of stairs if coming up from the north side. You can drive up from the northern side.
A lot a snow and a lot of fun activities
"Marvelous views of the city, especially at night. Easily accessible, free parking after a certain time on the weekends."
A nice viewpoint for breathtaking view of downtown Montreal!
Amazing views of the city! A must go when visiting Montr√©al. There is also a little lake at the bottom where you can rent canoes. It‚Äôs also a good spot to sit and just relax.
"The view at the top is absolutely breath taking. If on the top, visit the cafe for a fresh hot coco before you head back."
Very beautiful nature and a great view of city
Too many people gathered in same place. We changed our plan because of covid19
A great spot to view the city. Its a quite nice hike toward the chalet too.
Very awesome place to overlook Montreal. There is plenty of parking. And it's about a 10 minute walk to an amazing overlook. A in
"Pretty great park, good trails, wish I could race a car through there"
"Amazing views, but there‚Äôs a lot of people even though it‚Äôs quarantine"
Love the hike up. Love the view. Love the rest area at the top. Love it. Love it. Love it!!
"Simply gorgeous.  Nature at it's best, especially these days as indoor activities are not the safest."
The most beautiful spot in Montreal.
"A lovely park - I imagine it must be truly beautiful in the spring, summer, and fall. We visited mid-May and nothing was blooming yet and it was quite chilly, but it was still a lovely view."
Great big park right DT Montreal. Beautiful any time of the year
I've never seen such a beautiful place in my whole life
Love this place so much!
"Gorgeous park

"The park to go for all types of hikers, for tourist, for the #montrealaise who wants to go for bbq, picnic. Just enjoy the sun, enjoy the beautiful color of the leaves. ‚ù§"
Great vue
#1 place to visit in Montreal. Loved it
Most beautiful park. We got a bit lost as it was a blizzard the the trails were covered. The view from the Chalet was world class
To get a best view of the busy city! Both day time and night time views would be a treat to one's eyes.. We even had a chance of getting a view of a tiny bit of the Aurora Borealis! Just got lucky!
Mesmerising and very nice environment
Great views of the city. Good to go hiking or cycling
Such a beautiful view from up here
"The view is the best of Montreal but neither ""espectacular"" Specially we dont understand why this hill is called a ""Mountain"".
Beautiful building, it consists of s hughe hall. There is a little cafeteria in the back but they only got a very small variety of choiced. We missed hotwine st this cold time of the year in such a place! Also it would be nice, specially for the older visitors, if there would be some more seating possibilities..like couches with loungetabled!"
"A perfect way to exercise and enjoy the view of Montreal. Starting from McGill university, and climb stairs and you will reach chalet du mont royal. Lots of runners and bikers along the trails."
Amazing park. Great view.
Take a walk on the wild side
Nice place to visit
Beautiful view of the city at the end of a nice trail hike.
Best park in Montreal
Lovely views of city and river. Bring sun block if sunny warm day.
"What's not to love, this is my favorite mountain in Montreal, beautiful view of the city and a beautiful trail."
Beautiful any time of the year.
"Cool place with a great view, but I never understood the significance of the squirrels."
"Bike, walk, ski your way to the top each time is a new amazing experience!!"
"One of the best parks in Montr√©al. Must visit this park that was designed by the same designer of Central Park in New York. A lake, a great view of Montreal, a nice place to walk your dog, ride a bike, have a walk, or just chill on the grass. In winter, that lake becomes a nice ice skating place as well! Definetely a must for anyone living and viaiting Montreal!"
"Ice skating, sliding games.., good view point,, long forest walk"
Well one of the favorite place I love to visit in Montreal.
Great place to run up. We leave our place and run a solid 10k every Sunday. 5k up and 5k down. It's quite the nice treat on top :)
"Took a guided tour up the mountain, really just a hill, on electric fat tire bikes.  Awesome way to do it, just dress warm.  Our guide from Dyad bikes made sure we were all were dressed appropriately, and he even took along some extra gloves, scarves, and hats just in case ours weren't sufficient.  Our whole group was fine the whole time.  David was an excellent guide, and the trip was one of the highlights of our trip.  If you're thinking it might be too cold or rough, don't be afraid.  Go for it!"
Beatiful and breathtakingüíû
The park is great. These little raccoons aren‚Äôt afraid of people and come out to greet everyone and beg for food .
I do recommend this place for natural view and family barbecue.
Beautiful and great . I love this place
You are going to spend almost two hours in long traffic lines trying to find a parking spot. Later you should have a nice walk within the park and around the lake smelling fresh air. The kids' playground is also nice but there is no nearby washroom so little kids will be disappointed!
Most beautiful place you should visit befor death
Lucky me crossing it every day on my walk to work. Unique green island on this beautiful island called Montreal.
Best views in town. Taking the stairs from Peele is great cardio!
"Well it's a beautiful location where you can climb up to see most of Montreal city.

It's a bit hard to walk up during winter"
A gem of Montreal. Great views of Montreal and a nice scenic walk anytime throughout the seasons. This place never gets old.
"As a Montrealer walking on the mountain never gets old, is beautiful and clean and enjoyable seeing so many locals and tourists alike enjoying this park by the same designer as Central Park in NYC."
Awesome view especially the night view. Loved the location. Must visit in Montreal üòç
"If you ever visit Montreal, this is surely a must-see. Anytime of year. There are different things and best times of day to visit the Belvedere at the summit, for instance (although evening/night to see Montreal's skyline is probably my favorite), and also depending on how adventurous you feel, trying out winter activities is probably gonna be a blast (at the very least, to your inner child ü§™). There's also ice skate renting right beside the Beaver Lake, and cross-country skiing across different parts of the park.
In short, visiting this place being a must, having fun while doing it is a great idea, too!"
Great place to hang out with friends and get a nice view of the city
"Mesmerizing views, Nice place to enjoy free time,  soothing experience"
Best place of Montreal üòéüòé  Atmosphere is very neat and clean. It's rejoice us.
Nice hiking place. Good for families. Beautiful lake and natural landscape.
"Wonderful platform with great views and scenery of the city of Montr√©al. There was a exercise group that had an outdoor class there. There are a lot of bicyclists, runners, and travellers. Great place to watch a sunset."
"Beautiful park with well maintained paths and some really excellent sights! The view from the big overlook provides probably the best view around of the Montreal skyline, I was really privileged to be able to see it. It was very very icy when I was there, those stairs get completely covered, so make sure you're careful if you go in the winter, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the trip!"
"A nice bit of exercise getting up the stairs. They do a good job of maintaining the facility during the wintertime, making sure the park is not overly dangerous for walking."
A must visit in autumn season. Best place to see fall leaves.
"Very wholesome place, also welcoming"
"Big, beautiful park with biking/hiking/walking trails, very nice to enjoy the autumn scenery, perfect for families and picnics"
"One of the best night view in north America. You can easily get here by Bus 11 from Mont royal metro station. From Remembrance / Chemin du Chalet bus stop, it takes 5 minites to reach the deck on foot. The path to the deck is almost flat and lightened."
"Beautiful views, the first bus stop is higher up and there is a bar. We walked 15 mins to the second stop which has a huge house, tourist office and cafe. Lovely spot to take pictures"
So much fun. Easy hike. Best views of the city.
"Very beautiful views of the city. Short easy walk from the parking lot. No food up there, so bring snacks!"
"It‚Äôs a nice place for a hike and good views of the city, especially at night."
Beautiful spot with great views of the city.  A bit of a hike but there are options to make the trek a bit easier.  It is well worth the trip.
Beautiful sights. Trails everywhere! Parking in many places and the entire sight is clean and maintained.
"peaceful spot to sit and people watch, if you like that sort of thing."
"It is great to see so many people in the park enjoying all the beautiful attributes and surroundings the park has to offer. Staff was as usual super friendly as you would expect in Montreal. You can have a nice hike in the park. It is great to enjoy the fresh air, flowers, birds, and trees."
"Peace, in the city.....realy fresh airüòâ"
"Fantastic park in downtown montreal. Great for picnics, bbq and outdoor activities."
"Went off-track during a thunderstorm, that was nice, then got lost up top looking for the observatory which was not very well indicated. The view from there is nice if you like cityscapes."
Great hike. Beautiful view.
Good walk all the way up
A wonderful place with the magic of nature and it is very suitable for all age groups. I spent a beautiful time and it is one of my favorite destinations
Great place for a walk or biking. Lac aux castors is perfect for relaxing
This location provides a perfect city view of Montreal. Great hiking trails nearby and a perfect location to have a stroll with your kids.
Its a pretty good place specially if u go on bike
That view was just amazing and the walk unbelievable...
"Lovely trails and multiple viewpoints. I wish the trails were marked more clearly, as it was difficult to get out!"
Nice walk up a hill they call a mountain.
Ok chalet amazing! Cross almost as dissapointing as Plymouth Rock!
I'm there every weekend
"Gorgeous park to visit, so many tourist but very beautiful views!"
It had nice view of the city but not downtown skyline.
"The park is gorgeous, with plenty of nature to experience. It can take quite a while to walk to the top, but it's worth it. You pass a lake along the way, and towards the top is the Chateau. From there you can get an amazing view of Montr√©al below.

The park is simultaneously very pretty and very accessible. It doesn't look like much from the entrances at the bottom, but in just a couple of minutes you are engulfed in trees, shade, and paths. If you enjoy the beauty and cleanliness of Montr√©al then you should not skip Mount Royal Park."
A nice place to experience and spend an evening..
Worth the walk up for a fantastic view of Montreal. The center attached isn't a sit down restaurant but has some good snacks and drinks.
"Very nice trail, and amazing views of the city.   The trail is well marked and all the steep areas had stairs so it was easy to up and down."
Fun little hike and hangout! Beware how slippery it gets in the winter!
"The view from the top is breathtaking and if you don't like the crowd on the view point, just slip in to the woods and enjoy the peace."
The only vantage point in Montreal. Gotta hike for 20 mins to reach the top (stairs). Worth it.
"Great views of the city, and a nice climb to get there."
An oasis of relaxing and cheerful vibes.
"Very nice views, you can see the city from here. Great spot for pictures with nice architecture in the building and terrace surrounded by nature. Truly beautiful at dawn/dusk.  Set in a quiet park that's great for a relaxed walk or run. Parking is easily accessible."
"Definitely worth the walk! This park is a cultural and historical monument and the view from the top is spectacular.  On the downside, it can be a bit busy during peak hours, but it‚Äôs nice to see so many people interested in walking outside up and down the hill"
Beautiful place and scenic view overlooking Montreal. Place you must visit.
Nice view of Montreal
Very beautiful place. Perfect to spend time at with your close ones.
"This was a really neat place located smack dab in the middle of Montreal. It was quite a trek to get to the top, something not for the faint of heart or those not used to walking/climbing. That said, the view once you were at the top was fantastic! You are able to get drinks and light food once you're at the top and there are restrooms, too. Here's a tip: the restrooms are located in the basement of the building. There is one family style restroom on the main floor and a drinking fountain located close by. I saw several people that brought picnic food to enjoy, which is a great idea!  Another thing to note...the number of people. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and it was super, super busy. I'd recommend visiting if you are in town visiting."
Really wonderful place with breathtaking view of downtown Montreal and Lawrence river. You can do hike and bicycling in near mountains. Most of the places can be spited at top of the mountain.
Must visit when in Montreal. The hike is short and can be reached by mostly going up stairs through the park. Beautiful view over Downton Montreal.
"Easy accessible via car. Great hiking with stunning views of Downtown Montreal. Refreshments, icecreams, stores, and food available."
"Amazing park, people are gathering here and playing."
Waoooo it is so beautiful
"A great view of the city! Fantastic for ski reacreative in winter, and for running in summer."
It's a great park where you can go tu run or just walk. The view is beautiful and I suggest to go to the chalet while sunset
"Beautiful little mountain in Montreal. Nice lake, and amazing view on downtown."
"Super pretty park. If you visit Montreal this is must see place. It offers spectular views of the city along parts of the trail and of course when you reach the top. Its worth taking the view in and admiring the city and visualizing what it must have looked like when it was first discovered. If you're an avid runner looking for a new place to conquer, this is the place for you. Plenty of trails, plenty of stairs, and plenty of rolling hills to add any degree of difficultly to your run."
Very nice park that is one of the go to spots for tourists for visiting montreal. It was fun exploring the trails and visiting Maison Smith.
Very crowded evenings and weekends.
Amazing outdoor playground. Great xc classic and skate trails.
A must visit place when you are in the Montreal. Walking up is easy and very pleasant!
"Mount Royal is the most beautiful park in the city. It is large and features a manmade lake (no swimming allowed) with a small rocky waterfall at one end and plenty of area for picnicking. There is also a playground nearby. Towards the center of the park is the chalet and an outlook over the city, which boasts one of the best views in town. There is also another lookout further north in the park. Finally, there are tons of beautiful trails that are well worth checking out."
Awesome view. Not too crowded
Beautiful park!!! I love the parks in Montreal. Big spent two days trekking around the park. The lake side is beautiful lots of people hanging out on the weekend. Lots of hikers joggers and cyclists. More trails than time to explore. The tall trees and shade on trails keep the forest floor cool on really hot days which still makes going out on those really hot days worth it! The view is incredible from the chalet a must see.
"Amazing place to visit, breathtaking beauty. Must visit in fall."
Nice scenery for top view of Montreal.
"I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how beautiful the view was at night I went there on a date pretty cool
Scenery for a date especially at night not a lot of people there atleast when I went it was quite quiet and peaceful you could look over and see the skyline of the city very nice and beautiful i loved everything about that place and Inside the big hall place there‚Äôs a little history thing going on there very nice place to go and the hike up to the hill is totally beautiful definitely going back there so see what it is like over the summer and in day light becAuss it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful at night and it‚Äôs free to enter .. if this helps you kindly like this comment and hope you have a great day !!"
"Perfect place to watch all the city, beautiful place and prefect choice to take pictures."
Beautiful views all over the place and great photography opportunities. Worth the stair climb or walk. Bundle up in the winter it gets breezy!
"Absolutely beautiful, it's a must-see if you're visiting Montreal."
A quiet place to take a walk in the city. I went in the morning and then park had just a few joggers and walkers enjoying the scenery. Great views of the city await you outside the chateau.
Great view of the city! Totally recommend the hike
"Very touristy of course, it's a very nice uphill park in the woods. It rewards visitors after they're challenging zigzag uphill climb, with a breathtaking view of the whole Montreal and more if you look further. Food at cabin is pricey, I feel like they would make even more money if they lowered the prices.
It can get icy during winter, many people have slipped on the hills, dangerous!"
Awsome panaromic view of the Montreal downtown with numerous trails for jogging & cycling.
"Beautiful, vast park that's surprisingly easy to walk through. Lots to see and close to the Plateau Mont Royal neighbourhood."
A spectacular view of Old Montreal and the Saint Lawrence River. There are great running and walking paths. Simply a beautiful park.
If you visite Montr√©al this is a must see. The view of the city from the chalet is spectacular.
Beautiful view of the city and today's weather made it wonderful. A must visit place in Montreal.
"Great views of the city, embrace your inner basic B and snap a couple profile photos at the top"
great natural place a winter wonderland
"Winter is here, might as well enjoy it!"
Awesome place to relax and a great picnic spot.
"I could find many people for BBQ and party. If you are going to Montreal, make the trip up the hill, it's worth it.  The challenge is worth it! The sweat is worth it, and if you have to shed some tears to accomplish it, they are also worth it! This is also a great place to be mentally motivated to become more fit, as you may see a good amount of regulars venturing through their workout."
Beautiful view to Montreal city.
Must visit view point if you are a tourist.
This was a fun and semi-intense hike. Lots of stairs beautiful sights when you get to the top and theres a coffee shop and gift shop with great products and great prices. I would definately recommend it and do it again. The total hike doesnt take too long if you go at a steady pace.
Have few nice trails. One of the best places to visit in Montreal.
good place to spend afternoon and evenings and bbq party
"So I have been to three view point of the city.
1. Ferris wheel at the port of an old city
2. Observatory 360 in the city centre
3. Mont royal park
I can say that observatory give you the biggest angle of view (360), so you can see everything in any direction possible. You can see Olympic stadium, old port, almost everything. So it is worth visiting.
2. Mont royal park view point is mainly facing city centre, but you can also view some other parts of the city, so it is not as good as observatory, but it is definitely worth visiting
3. From ferris wheel you can't see much because of the skyscrapers, so it is not really worth it."
"Beautiful view of the city and this weekend ,(Victoria Day) the tulips were just gorgeous"
Great place to relax
"Suitable for kids and adults. Vast area with greenery. Can do barbecue and have drinks enjoying the summer. For kids there are some climb-ups, seesaw type play items. There's a good refreshment area and snack store. A good place to find a sunny day's bliss!!"
Beautiful view! Short walk. Little cold on our trip.
Great hike up the mountain. And the view is nice
Great place for a walk. The park is huge with many trails to explore.
Beautiful day.
"This pinpointed location on Google Maps is by the Mont Royal parking lot. If you're here for the observation deck to enjoy panoramic views of downtown Montreal AND are arriving by car, definitely drive to this location. The observation deck is another 800 meters from here, and can only be reached by foot. Because this location sits at a higher elevation, the hike shouldn't be too daunting. My 55-year old aunt did just fine.

Of course, there are other ways to reach the observation deck, but all of them require some hiking. If you're downtown, you can start hiking at the foothills along Pine Ave or Cedar Ave. That hike is more uphill and might be daunting for some.

Wear comfortable walking shoes, bring water and provisions, and enjoy the view! There are visitor amenities at the observation deck, including restrooms, a gift shop, and a small cafe."
Great park to decompress
Best view in Montreal. About a 20 minute walk from the Loews hotel to the top but you will burn 5000 calories. You go up several flights of stairs.
"Best sunset view of the city!
Worth the walk to the Chalet!"
Good place to see eclipse haha.
So many stairs but definitely worth it for the view! Thankful for the cafe at the top with cold drinks.
Great view of the city. Great to ride your bike through.
Amazing park. Lots of happy people ^^ clean and nice lake üëç
Impressive views.  Nice open/spacious area
Crowded and a bit dirty. Trails require sime maintainance.
Great place for hiking with a beautiful view of the city at the peak.
"A beautiful view from this point, no matter what time of the year you go. From Jacques Cartier Bridge to Champlain Bridge, Montreal's finest beauties are visible from here."
Nice view other than that just a traditional city park
Excellent place to visit anytime.
"Love it, coffee, water tabs, washroom available"
"It was clean, quiet and peaceful. The views from the lookout are always great"
"One of the best urban parks in Quebec.
You get to be in the forests in 10 walking distance from downtown Montreal. Absolutely lovely"
"I believe Mount Royal park is unique in all aspects! Has trails, view points, bike lanes, piknik spots, events and one of the best thing is the tam-tam music collective on Sundays. The mountain is something we can call the all allowed to do, except for a fire. You can bring your bet, cat, dog and others without a problem just to take care of their necessities. Also it is allowed to drink and smoke weed on Sundays close to the Statue, which is Park Ave. between Ave des Pins and Mont-Royal street.
Every Montrealer should feel lucky in having such an amazing park like Mount Royal.
I hope you enjoy the mountain during the summer. For me the best time to take advantage of summer activities!"
"Must see in Montr√©al, awesome. Nice walks in the shadow of the park, pretty walk downstairs to the city."
Very romantic place. The best to go there is the after noon.
My favourite place to hike ~ relaxing ~ and walk. The view is amazing up there üëåüèΩ
Iconic location to hike and a must see for anyone visiting the city. It's the best spot to see the skyline. I also saw a groundhog there üòç
gorgeous day and splendid in the middle of heaven
I love this place when it's not that cold during the winter.
Great evening views of Montreal.  And we momentarily enjoyed the company of the biggest raccoon I've ever seen.
"beautiful park located above montr√©al, adjacent to one side to McGill uni. the wide gravel trails switchback to the top making for a moderate incline walk or run. great escape from the city and enjoy a walk, bike, run, or just sit!"
Great trails up the mountain.  Beautiful scenery.
Montreal's downtown look as heaven from here
Best outdoor hub in Montreal!
"Ice rink, sledding hills, music on loud speakers, great views.. A magical place with lots to keep you busy."
"From Mont Royal we were able to see Montreal by night and on top of that they had fireworks that night. It was beautiful.  We enjoyed the view and the weather was awesome.
Sad thing they were raccoons all over the garbage can doing what they know betterüòÇüòÇüòÇ.
Une place recommand√©e √† Montreal."
"Beautiful Park !!!
I just think it does need some Direction Signs! Easy to get lost in there!"
Love it here. Best to go mid week when there are few people.
No better place to visit in the fall. Love it!
It is mainly a nice view of the city. Other than that you will like it if you like hiking.
"Many walking, skiing, and snowshoeing trails in addition to the skating and sledding ‚úå"
What a great veiw of Montreal's skyline!
This park is beautiful. The views of the city are stunning no matter where you are. The hiking trails are easy to navigate too. You can pick up maps at the visitor center that detail trail lengths and difficulties so you can plan your visit accordingly.
"Great park for picnic, relaxing, music, hiking, yoga and any other outdoor activity."
Beautiful view of downtown. Nice greenery all around.
Wonderful in all seasons. Must see and do.
"Great views of the Montreal

Great place to go for a walk and a trek and of many people going for a run. This is definitely challenging depending on the route taken.

Well worth getting away from the hustle of the city for some peace and quiet. Definitely worth getting away from the vehicle pollution and sewage smell in downtown Montreal."
"Amazing views from the top, great for fresh air and for long walks in a forest, don't miss the beauty of the sunset!! I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't always filled with potheads!!"
"It's a nice park, went in October, beautiful colors, breathtaking view of Montreal from Lookout, so many trails to choose from, available parkings, and busses, Caf√©s for bites, had a good time."
Watching Montreal from the top will make you feel lucky for living here.
Great place for escaping the urban environment
"A must to go place if you are in montreal. It is ideal for any season. Many trails.. in summer for hiking, and in winter for cross country skiing. Once you on the top, the view is worth the hike. You can choose different legth of trails to hike, if not there is local bus no. 11 that goes from ""mont royal"" subway station close to the parking lot close to a short trail to the peak."
Great place to spend quality time. You can see the whole Montreal from top
"Decent climb to the top. Not like real mountain climbing , but plenty of stairs to trek to get to the top."
Walked to Mt. Royal Park. What a great view of the city.
"I was expecting a park, but found a piece of forest in the middle of the city.
Great trails and lookouts."
Great park to explore. Great in winter. Plenty of skiers about and paths are still very walkable
Must visit place if you‚Äôre in Montreal!
In the middle of downtown Montreal nice 360 degrees view of the beautiful city
A must-see for any visitor to Montreal.
The city of Montreal is named after it. A mount in the middle of the city.Offers a great view of the city. Worth a visit.
Beautiful lookout spot. You can see all of downtown Montreal  from here. The walk up here is awesome too. One of my favorite spots in the city. Dow
Beautiful views of the city! Great place to relax and enjoy the views
"Iconic historical natural mountain park in the heart of Montreal. Beautiful trails to walk all over, historical buildings housing museums, beautiful picnic grounds with majestic trees and spectacular views overlooking the city and the St-Laurence river."
"Interesting urban park, reasonable hiking and an interesting set it paths and biking trials into the park. It's at best a half days worth of roaming around. Would recommend walking as much of it as possible."
What an amazing view from the top. We visited on Dec 23 and it was chilly up there. Dress appropriately according to the weather. A must visit.
Stunning view of the city. Lots of people enjoying themselves and kids running around everywhere. My 2 year old loved it! Obligatory stop if you're in Montreal!
"It's so serene to go running , walking or simply people watching, great for children to run n play around too."
A good intermediate hike with a lovely view of Montreal to cap things off
Amazing place where you can enjoy beautiful vew.
Quite the view. The hikes are long but not difficult. I highly recommend bringing a picnic and some wine for at the top.
Best way to shred some weight by taking the staircase to reach top viewüòù
"Beautiful view ,a lot of small trails and clean washroom."
"I love Mount Royal Park.  Nice place to hike or jog or bike or walk.  Beautiful view of Montreal, probably the best view you can have.  Not too many cities offer the greenspace Montreal does, you have a great opportunity for some inter-city ecotourism here. On the other side of the park (park avenue side in front of the statue) you also a child's swimming pool and great recreational play area."
Very beautiful landscape
Always a nice place for a walk early in the day before the  crowds show up.
A bit icy on the walkways... could use some sand or salt. Great views of the city.
The best place to get relaxed.....I preffer going at nights or evenings...

The best place to visit in Montreal hands down....extremely beautiful and naturistic...feels like a hill station in the middle of the city.
"Visited in the fall, the colors all around were amazing! Everything is so well maintained that it's a pleasure just walking around and letting the kids enjoy the expansive open areas and rolling hills."
Beautiful place for all. Good spots for BBQ.
"Great view, it was easy to go there by bus, there is just one route, so you have to check the schedules for the last ones."
"Lots of space, good place for social distancing,   cool lake and nice statues"

Fun is to go in groups and climbing the hill during winter is lovely.

"An iconic place in Montreal, plenty of stuff do do, summer activities, winter activities. People are usually very kind and they don't mind passing on a full say parking ticket when the occasion arrises.

Lots of green spaces. Lots of trails for hiking.

Cars can now cross again!"
Nice views of the city! Perfect place to relax!
Worth to pay two hours of parking and go urban hiking or biking. Best views of the city are here.
I loved the hike (approx. 45 mins) and the view was worth it both during the day and at night. It was a little confusing figuring out how to get to the peak but that made for a fun adventure. Getting down was quick and easy if you use the stairs. Great place for a picnic or biking around if you're not feeling the hike.
Good to relax for a bit
One of my favorite spots in Montreal. Easy access and great views. Only bummer is paying for parking .
"Awesome view.
Maybe you walk a lot, but it's worth it.
Is pretty amazing and beautiful.
You need to go there at least one time when you arrive to Montreal"
nice hike and reaching the chalet was worth the uphill march.
Cool place. Iconic Montreal park
Really nice place to hike or take a break from the city with a breastaking view.
"Wide, open space to enjoy Montreal's landscape. Take the bus and enjoy your time walking the trails of Mount Royal. You won't be disappointed."
The gem of Montreal with the best views
you can enjoy the nature
Great views with so many different nature trails to explore
Once you climb to the top you'll be rewarded with outstanding views of Montreal and beyond.
"Lovely as always, perfect spot for a hike, stroll or picnic all year round"
"About an hour walk to the top( if you take the long way up ) or about 30-40 min if you take the stairs to the chalet. Best view in the city. Nice little coffee shop too for a quick drink and a snack. Bathrooms, water, and vending machines ‚Ä¶"
Perfect for the people that loves contact with nature and something like this... I loved and miss so much there
"A really beautiful park with lots of activities around snow in the winter. You can just walk through the park and around the frozen lake, or really get yourself excited while sliding, cross-country skiing etc.

Also such an amazing view over the whole city, it's really awesome! The small waterfalls of ice are really beautiful, too."
Good exercise reward with view overlooking Montreal downtown.
Great place to unwind
Picturesque panorama view over Montreal.
A great spot to see skylines in any reason!
Nice view of the city. And vantage point
Stunning iconic view on the downtown
Good place to take your family or host a children‚Äôs birthday event.
"Lots of history, great view. Nice place."
"Quite chuffed I climbed those stairs at my age, was worth it with amazing views, loved mount Royal park!!"
Amazing place to exercise in the heart-crown of the city.
Excellent place for outing. There is kids play area which is well maintained. Mostly busy and crowded on weekends. Very vibrant place. Lots of options for the entire family to enjoy.
"A wonderful park for walk and talk, with friends, family, dogs or even alone. The paths are nicely setup with various landscaping ideas. It is built to satisfy the senses. The environment will satisfy your eyes, nose and ears. With the wind slightly blowing and the water flowing, this is the kind of Feng Shui that will enrich your mind."
Very nice place!!
"I didn't like this park, it is so old"
"Great place! There is a playground for older kids, playground for younger ones, sprinklers, basketball court, soccer nets, fields and big benchs to watch people play and relax."
Crowded due to covid-19
"If you like pretty colors, especially the color green, this park got you covered! There is green grass on the ground, green leaves in the trees (during summer) but luckily no green asparagugus! The sky is very blue during a sunny day, grey on rainy day and a dark black at night (the park closes at 11pm though so no late night shenanigan!). There is a playground for kids complete with those water thingies to have fun (and annoy their parents) on a hot summer day. Overall, I'm very satisfaction concerning my park experience in this park."

Cool park with a nice flat area for some sports and activities... Floor is a little bit too slippery..
"No matter if it's Winter or Spring, this park is beautiful. Obviously, it is more appealing with a temperature that allows humans to be there at least one hour without problems, but nature has its beauty all the time. You can walk, take a sunbath or play p√©tanque! People from ""Universit√© de Montr√©al"" and the HEC, use to come at lunch time. Nice place!"

"They just redid the park and it looks great. A nicer layout, great places for children with a fenced in area for the younger ones, a water park and some open grass with a really nice monument. The Bixi station is also here so that adds some convenience also."
Great safe fenced in parks for children of all ages 3 different jungle gyms and a sprinkler! The only issue... over the summer was the big blue open top garbage bins all over the stretch of grass... they attracted a lot of wasps which made my experience less pleasant as I am allergic to bug bites and had to keep changing spots to sit down.
Great park .It has a big open field which is occupied most of the time.Many chairs to sit and enjoy the weather.A mini water park for kids and a calisthenic gym.

Beau parc tour pr√®s de plein de resto comme chocolat favoris
Nice place for a run and a view of the city. I am luck to kive just roubd the corner...
Nice panoramic place to visit for relaxing and meditation. This park seems clean and well maintained. The view of the Saint-Lawrence river is gorgeous whatever season you go. You can also find nice spots for fishing. There is a well maintained wooden bridge that takes you deep into the scene. There are also picnic tables and swings. Do not expect big square traditional park. It is more like a ribbon along nearby road that has a reasonable space to enjoy nature and superb view. Lot of parking spaces along the street. I didn't notice any toilets in the area. If you found this review helpful please don't forget to like it.  Enjoy your experience!
one of many nice open place near the river to relax. good for both family and friends.

Very nice place and I will go there again in the future, I like that is not far from where I live and it‚Äôs not very busy in the week-ends.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find it pleasant easy accessible and comforting."
The path is great to walk and the views are beautiful.
Sittin on the docks
Small park near the river with some sitting area. Relaxing spot for a great water view.
"If you love to watch the sunrise or the sunset,   this location is beautiful. This fall is a great time to go and find beautiful pictures.

üòä
Such a wonderful assembling area. The first time feels like in one of the European cities. Just needed a public restroom.
"No dogs allowed. Seems more for children, that's fine. People do picnic here on the limited tables."
Quite calm park even though Mont-Royal street is just south of the park. Great for kids. Small playground for young children.
"Perfect quiet neighborhood park, and a nice playground for the litte ones.
Koodo ‚úå"
Not very clean..garbage cans overflowing and no snow maintenance.
We love this parc to enjoy the water jets. It's precious when it's warm outside and you need a quick refresh. Plus it's right over the mont Royal Avenue so if you need to do shopping before or after it's a good spot
Very nice park with a lot of trees and a playground for kids. Very family friendly. We loved it!
Beautiful park
Good place to have a picnic with your friends!
Great family hideout close to mtl street however there are often times people passed out after a night of party and or different communities using the water park for hygenic purposes which I am actually ok with but it might not be your thing if you have small kids with you. When with the kido we opt out for water parks that are kids only.

Small park with the essential to play for babies and kids.
I love it very clean and cool
"Great place to bring young children! When the chalet is open, there is a bathroom, water fountain and various toys that the park allows the children to use.
Only problem is that I once went when there were some obnoxious teens smoking in the park, but if you tell them to get lost the park is a nice place again!
Many seats for adults to sit and a baseball field right next to the park if your child would like to practice. Overall cute Parc Petit is a cute little park."
I dislike this park. It is old and needs repairs. One of the worst parks in St-Laurent.
This park is a bit small but it has space for older kids and younger kids. There is space to run around or for a young child to use their bike. There is also a baseball field. My little sisters love this park.
Nice & pretty place
What a horific park. Needs a revamp  looks like it hasn't been touched since the 70s . All these taxes and this is what we get. Good job DeSousa.
Small kiddie park with a baseball field and few kid's games. It's hard to access due to lack of parking however.
Not bad
Nice place for  family and kids
Nice baseball field
Lieu Anglophone. TR√àS d√©sagr√©able. Je vais passer tout droit les prochaines fois.
Nice & clean park for everyone. Good variety in the kids' playgrounds. Nice to have a picnic by the trees in the shade. A splash pad or some form of water activity to stay cool would be a great addition.
"üëç ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The park is very calm and quiet. It is situated in residential area and has some essential and basic toys for children. They might need refreshing the paint and some maintenance but their situation is not too bad. The park has a sand place for kids to play as well üòÄ and people can bring their bicycle inside the park."

Great park but no 'usable'toilet.
Nice little park
"Nice little place to stop and take a break, while in transit or to just get out to have some outside time if you live in the area. If you have kids, the playground seems like it would be pretty fun given the layout and variety of games to play on the jungle gym."
Have been going to this park since I was a kid and now I am bringing my 2. Always super friendly parents and friendly people coming by and just genuinely my kids favorite park in the hood.
"For such a small park, it's decent. If you're close by with kids, it's worth while. Been here often."

Great selection of outdoor equipment for such a small park!
Excellent place to chill and relax. Excellent Park for the kids. Connected to the bike path and train station.
"It's a small park, good if you live near it, but not worth to drive from far. Good for a break if you are riding a bike in the Maisonneuve's bike lane."
Nicely maintained and shaded by nice trees on hot and humid days. Neighbourhood would look much different without it.
Used to be a great park. Now it's too dirty.
Adult size swings are in Peak existence

Small park in the West island
Beautiful main field. You should see if in the evenings once curfew is lifted. Great for casual walks with a soft bounce in your step due to the rubbery texture of the track and field 400m track.

Nice track and football field!
Relaxing.
It is a very nice place because everybody is able to be in touch with nature and feels relaxed.
There is everything that you need to do like for sport and a playground for children
"I went to the riverside park to exercise at 6 o'clock this afternoon. I don‚Äôt know what organization was taking up the entire playground. They kept escorting us away, completely occupying the entire playground to engage in their movements. They asked us to leave in a very rude language, and the attitude was very tough. However, when we came in, we did not see any announcement telling us that the playground was closed today. I really want to complain about them. But I don't know what organization they are and who is responsible. I only know that they were already there at 6 o'clock in the afternoon of 2019-06-12. I feel very angry. Other friends also feel unhappy."
"I've lived near this park my whole life. The football field still has issues, and has been replaced by a new field at the center of the racetrack. The playground itself has seen better days, and probably (definitely) needs a refresh. The facilities are adequate, but again, need refreshing. The running track itself is in fairly good condition thus far. Give it a few years, I'm certain it will fall into the state of disrepair it was in previously. This is LaSalle afterall."
Great place for workout and deep thinking
Really nice tracks to run. Lanes for sprints and long jump. Perfect place and we'll maintained.
Enjoyed the park great for my boys to play and get out for some fun

"It was such a good time! Splash parc, parc, bathroom, clean, picnic tables.... Its a gr8 place!"

"Great water fountains in summer, with plaground for the kids. Just off of pierrefonds blvd. Turn rightj on chemin sources going north to gouin blvd. On your right side. Cute smaller size parc."
This a great park for everyone. Swings and slides for different age groups. Nice picnic area also. And a huge splash pad with all sorts of different sprays.
It is very amazing park
Very nice kids are love it
Nice park since they add the water games but bathroom is often very dirty  but  overall a nice park to go with the family.Another good addittion to the park maybe it will be a water fountain to  drink some water.
Very nice park and the water games are amazing but the toilet is always filthy üò£
The kids were playing tennis and the tennis court was wery clean
Great place with moduls for all ages and with water play games
Nice park. No complaints except bathroom was filthy
"Very slow service, ordered just poutine, weighting over 15 min, then cancelled it because they care about service √† l'auto even only 2 customers in the restaurant. Very oily smell that stick to clothing. I won't step there are more."
The water park is a great addition...
"Nice park, with soccer field and water park."

"Great park place for young children, but it's a bit small for the community around."
"Very nice little park, family and kids oriented."
Love Ukraine! üá∫üá¶
"Beautiful small and cozy park. Well suited for children. You can enjoy a picnic, or eat on one of the tables. There is a pinpong table available for everyone."
Great Environnement! And a ping pong table!!
"Small cozy and family-friendly park with a pinpong table, a fenced park with swings for small kids and adults, and toy fortresses with sliding ramps. There are tables to have lunch or have a seat."
a good place to relax with your family
Great family friendly park.
Nicely renovated parc. Right next to a beautiful church.
Really cute park with water park for kids and a ping pong table
A nice little park that gets very busy at certain hours with kids but is usually quiet. No dogs allowed means cleaner grass too.
Nice park! Water fountain is fun.
"Park is not big but has everything for relaxing. Benches, children playground and trees for shade reading."
"This is a small parc, two main sections, one just grass they always take care and is always in good shape and the other is for the smaller kids. There is a small piscine that I never saw they activate."
"Dropped in on the Ukrainian festival. Great food, friendly people and a great event."
Nice park
Nice space but a bit rundown
Ping pong on cement table
Good park
Ukrainian festival
Very good Park there
Few modules in a derelict state
You can visit Annual Ukrainian Festival every September.
Great park
Nice spot to grab some Portuguese chicken and have a lunch. Kids park is a little old but still fun for the young ones.
Nice park to sit and relax.
We really enjoyed this park. It was right near our airbnb location and so easy to get to. It has lots of trees for shade which you don't often see in parks. The climbing structures are pretty new and the kids really enjoyed them. We had a picnic in the park (along with other people) and it was nice and cool and comfortable even though it was a hot day.
Too bad they don't allow dogs
Nice park :) a great spot to relax or grab some thing to eat and have it there.
A strange space but a classic in the neighborhood
New place it ok
Doing ‚öΩÔ∏è  for kids with Sports ball. Awesome
Cute small park
Beautiful compact park
Really good place.
Nice little park
Great
Good
"One of the reasons why I wanted to live close by. This park is amazing. Not just for families and children but for gym enthusiasts, as the park has structures to help in between A jog, some chin ups, etc etc. Its all so cleverly constructed. A mix of well manicured grassland mixed with the wilderness of the reeds and amazing for the wildlife. A true harmony between people and nature. A bit of everything for everyone!"
"Nice park with kids playground, artificial lake and small hills. Also perfect for picnic on a nice sunny day. It's surrounded by beautiful and typical houses style of Bois-franc."
Nice sunny and warm day for a walk on the path. Plenty of park benches and picnic tables. Needs more accessible garbage cans.
"Well designed with fitness circuit. Well maintained ice rink. Longer chairs, pond, water parc with fountains for kids and hill for sledding. Basketball court needs some sort of fence though to prevent ball from bouncing away all the time. More garbage cans close to basketball court is needed as there is tons of trash from kids too cool to pick it up. Remove the no dogs signs, let people have dogs on leashes in this dog hating city. People pick up after them and I never see them on the lawn anyways. Dog parc at the end of the lake is terrible with large rocks and they put grass every year that gets torn up by digging holes and running which turns to mud when it rains. Common sense eludes these parc planners."
"Pretty park in very rich neighborhood, there's something for everyone here. Could use a petanque court or two and more waste bins as inconsiderate people leave their trash on the ground"
Very good choice for children fun and ...parents relax
Absolutely beautiful. People social distancing. Very clean üëå
Great place to spend time outdoors with the family
Quiet and clean place

Beautiful place and amazing view to walk to
"Parc en d√©veloppement, tr√®s spacieux, juste les c√¢bles √©lectriques g√¢chent un peu le paysage"
Very nice and quiet park. Has lots of shades and a bike path. It also has a basketball court and a grass area for soccer. It is very well taken care of. It has a couple of picnic tables and some benches too
Its good but not that good
"Small, but we'll maintained"
Nice place
Take a break
It's a nice place for afternoon lunch outside
Unfortunately not a clean place at all which is sad for the kids living in the area :(
Really nice to chill out in the summer.
"Un espacio para que los ni√±os jueguen, no muy grande."
Bel endroit pour relaxer et pouvoir sarroser
It's a very nice parc. With different types of kids equipments.
"Very nice , has parking and is open still after10pm."
Good
"Parc F√©lix-Antoine-Savard is a small neighborhood park that happens to have a basketball hoop which is popular with residents. It could get noisy, so if you require a quieter setting, just walk down the block for a couple of similar public spaces minus the hoop. At the southern edge of the park, there's a huge mural that will impress you with its quality."
Cool and Beautiful place amazing to see it maintained here.
"A cool place to see when visiting Quebec City. Loved the beautiful grounds, the richness of heritage was amazing to see. It's incredible how much history is maintained here ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç"
"Located in an otherwise rather busy downtown area, this greenspace gives you a chance to chill out and relax. There are a number of benches to hang out, sip your coffee, eat lunch, etc. There is also a statue of Sir John A. MacDonald, Canada's first Prime Minister. Centrally located and close to a number of core downtown landmarks."
"Oldschool brew pub watering hole type of place.  Has a good selection of standard type of beers on tap brewed in the pub.  Solid good beers, but not outstanding. I liked the raspberry most, after trying most of them on tap.  You can get flights there and the poutine is good too."
Yes Montreal is crazy cold in winter but have fascinating landscapes in Summer.
"Beautiful small park in the center of downtown Montreal, perfect to have lunch in during summer :)"
Simple park where you can relax for a while and enjoy the city
"Located in the city center across from Cathedrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde and near the Bell Center.

Pleasant and serene with some nice sculptures and monuments."
Great place to relax! Almost like a Central Park in NYC
"Going to this park was a nice experience but now that the  J.A.Macdonald statue was toppled August 29th, 2020 the park won't be the same."
This is a really great spot to spend a few minutes exploring and walking around. You are steps away from some of the best shopping and local restaurant destinations the City of Montreal has to offer. Can't we all use a few minutes of calm in the midst of hustle and bustle? Be sure to check out some of the Canadian history found within the monuments here. You'll have to look up from this Google Review though. Enjoy
a must see in Montreal
Nice place to walk in rhe mornung and late afternoon. Clean and green.
Really good fish and chips!  Nice location too

"A really nice park it's honestly one of the nicest one in Montreal, clean peaceful and a great 20 minutes meditation area ! I recommend this park !"

Beautiful place in Montreal. Good to see on a sunny day.
Beautiful park in the winter!
"Beautiful green space with historic and amazing structures within and nearby. No washroom facilities directly in the space, but there are public washrooms in the nearby tourist information centre"
Centrally located and recently renovated square is a perfect spot to relax while appreciating the surrounding architectural point of interest.
Been a long long time they r doing renovation on the entrance door and its just so hard to get into the building. They are not finishing it. 1 star well deserved.

Pretty calm and fun there. However there are lots of weed smokers and vapers.
Good place....
"Well maitained park. Have very good memories. Two swings placed in the sandy play area are too close to those playing on the slide. The swings need to be placed elsewhere to avoid accidents. When I told the supervisor, he asked me, a visitor,  to write to the Mayor ! This review may please be sent to the right person who can do the needful."
Beautiful place and many space for kids to play and parents to rest

Breathtaking scenery of Montreal and Laval!
Beautiful scenic walk by the water.
"First time going out in the outside world to play Pokemon Go. Expected to find Perry the platypus, but found other creatures. Would visit again."
A little bit of nature in the big city... very relaxing. Some people even try to fish. Cool sunsets.
Easy access between Laval/Montr√©al for bikes/pedestrians. Nice views both sides. Toilets and some service on Laval.

Nice
"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much to say about this place. It‚Äôs great for a picnic, or an outside gathering with friends. Bixis and bike paths are near this place, as well as mount royal and many restaurants as you are between plateau and downtown."
"A little covid won't hold back the fun and games to be had at the park! Have a picnic, BBQ, watch people play tennis or hockey in winter, and tam tams whenever the weather is acceptable. There's softball as well, just bring all the equipment and teams. It's a great part of the city and I hope it never changes."
"Great place for family and friends. Lots of amenities, great playground, beach volleyball, soccer fields and skating rink."
Its a great place to play sports or to Barbecue. They finally reopen the Bathroom but there is only one outhouse. Yes one for hundreds of Park dwellers. Still a nice place to hang out and 420 with a couple of IPA's..
We enjoyed walking through the woods to the Mount Royal cross. It was an amazing experience.
I had such a great time today! Met a new friend here :) I must say this place is a few degrees vooler than the city! üòâ
"The park is close the mountain. If you like smoking weed, here is the popular spot. There is a bixi stop as well."
"Needs a few more open bathrooms for the amount of people taking advantage of the green space, but it's a beautiful park!"
"Great big park in the heart of Montreal. Lots of small shops around to grab a bite to eat. However, public bathrooms are HORRIBLE so make sure you do your business somewhere else or wait to get home!"
"a good park to hang out, you always hear the music and beats every sunday from across the street"
Very nice and well maintained park. So convenient for joggers as well as bicycling and of course walkers üòÅ
"I fell asleep here once in 2007, no one bothered me"
"Nice big park, beautiful trees for shade on a hot day"
Massive space. Relatively clean compared to other parks lately.
Great parc to hangout with friends and to play some beach volleyball.
"Fun place for young children (under 8). Many choices of play grounds.. and a chance to discover your fun. This park got many trees, so many shades too. Also there are few picnic tables too"
Loved it but didn't feel very covid safe. No one is wearing masks
Big and friendly park with activities for the family. Easily accessible
There is no parking around. And this parking doesn't have a relax environment because from every side is ended with the city. I went there with car but all the time i was having stress.
Very lively and leads to fantastic trails! Huge tennis court and field.
This park in the summer and so many good memories.
Great but the ground is littered with garbage so you cannot walk barefoot
Very beautiful and an ideal place to start a walk on the Mount Royal. Good place to go with the kids too
Beautiful park an mountain to jog..walk. Hike... picnic..or just enjoy outdoor

On the best parks in montreal. I love this place....
Like to go for a walk or bike ride on a nice sunny Sunday.
"Nice open large green area for walking, sporting actvities, relaxing or seeing the cross of Mont Royal especially at night. If you happen to find a Hippie party like I did, you will have great fun..."
"Gorgeous park! Always full of people having picnics, a lot of good dogs, and there's even an open mic there on Mondays! It has a football pitch and tennis courts as well, which are always busy through the late hours of the night. Nearby to a Bixi station, and right across the street from Mt Royal Park."
"Spacious park near McGill university. Located at the Plateau area, this lucious park hosts soccer fields, benches and open green spaces where many people kick it out and chill. You can see people having a pinic, playing spikeball, dancing, even having a BBQ. Great place to bring friends and family to have a relaxing time."
"Lovely, shaded playground at the foot of Mount Royal. Older kids playground with lots of unique climbing including a large web tower and heavy rope bridge. Fun circle swing and nice old trees surround the playground. Younger kids playground is entirely fenced (a few gates) with several small areas for sand play, climbing and spinning equipment. Nearby toilets make it a perfect afternoon spot. Small paddle pool available nearby. Ignore the hours on google, the playground should be open until dark."
"Very scenic and spacious park; the grass and surrounding landscape is well kept and it's a great environment to relax, go for a stroll, or take part in physical activity. Small pods of people are typically seen picnicking around the park, as well as lots of walkers, runners, pets, and people playing games.  This is one of my favourite spots to go in Montreal, when the weather is tolerable!"
"Zu, fun and tam tams on the weekends"
This is a spacious park but it is spring in the city loads of dirty snow
Best getaway in the city to relax with family and friends in summers
A big and beautiful park with an amazing playground.

"Nice park with lots of seating space on the grass. Perfect for playing frisbee. People are often slack lining or playing games on the big fields.
On weekends, people play Tam-tams (not my favourite feature but some seem to enjoy the vibe).
There‚Äôs not much shade except if you head higher up into the Mont Royal.
There is a field where people LARP."
"Used to live directly across the street. Miss it so much. Spent hours there with my dog. This is where I took her so her friends could say goodbye before she passed. It's a beautiful, lively park."

Very great place to enjoy the time
I love this park but I ran out of gas right in front of it and I had to wait two hours to get rescued while it was minus 20¬∞. so I would say the park is beautiful but what I hate most about it is that it's super windy and it led to me having hyperthermia. Hahaha
"It‚Äôs very beautiful!!! You can relax there, enjoy the weather, do whatever you want with your family or friends."
"Beautiful park where you can do a lot of different things - sports and exercise, picnics and BBQs, relaxing. The park is spacious and has a great view of the city and Mont Royal. There is also easy access to the Mont Royal running and biking trail. Facilities and amenities at the park include a tennis court, football field, baseball pitch, volleyball court, washrooms and a gazebo. It is easily accessible as the 80 and 129 busses stop right by the park. However, due to all these amazing features, it can get extremely crowded on warm summer days, especially during covid!"
"Went on a Sunday and there was a handmade market throughout the park, as well as alot of people playing drums! Was a really cool to experience!"
"Great view of the mountain, lots of Europeans in that park! If you are missing home or the diversity of language!

Must go if you feel like playing Tennis, Soccer, baseball or just a picnic in the park :)"
This huge park is great if you want to have a picnic while respecting social distances. There is enough space for everyone. Plus there is a soccer field!

Love the people there, the ambiance and music on Sundays at ‚ÄòTams‚Äô; and no one bothers you and are respectful."
Beautiful very large park with gated tennis courts and several educational play areas for children or different ages. It is right at the base of the Mount Royal so you can enjoy that as well. It‚Äôs very well maintained and with new infrastructures. Very much worth the visit. Definitely going there again.
Great place if you can find a nice spot. Avoid the crowded areas and if you can find open spots and you're golden.
Could be refresh but fun park
This place offers an island of nature in an ocean of concrete. Very appreciable especially during lockdown
Ohhhh where is my hair brush
"Nice park for walks and jogging. There is a path to follow to go up Mont Royal and also a path around the park. Water fountains and bathroom are on site but not very clean.
There are several tennis courts and availability is not bad. It's outdoor and only available in the summer. There is also a big turf field that's usually reserved for organized games but we always manage to find a spot on the field to play on weekends. The park is dog friendly. Tam-tam park is across the street and lots of fun on Sundays."
What an amazing place to hang out and chill.  A must see for anyone visiting Montreal.
Nice park for chilling or sports. Or both. Less crowded than Lafontaine or Laurier! We go there with our kids.
Great atmosphere lots of space unfortunately the football/soccer field seems innacessible unless you call the city
Greate place for walking.
"Nice things are spacious, has hiking area sort of and some nice statues. Down side is no washroom in sight nor a water fountain nearby."
Beautiful Park everytime I visited in Montreal that's good
Lovely place to walk. Nice break from the noise of the city. Would be 5 stars of they had a dedicated dog area for all hours. The park is big enough.
Nice park in Montreal!
Peaceful place!
"Montreal's heart. Just a nice park to enjoy a soccer game , go for a walk or a bike ride."
A nice park with a lot of sitting areas. Didn't get to see much of it as it was night time when we strolled by.
"Nice space,
tennis courts,football,baseball and others you can have your picnic or exercise here."
"A landmark of Montreal. Although there are many quieter nooks, there's definitely something to be said of its liveliness."
"This is a lovely oasis in the middle of the city. Artists have used this park, it's setting and the people who frequent it, as their inspiration. It is fun to see all the different kinds of people who wander through here and who use it as their playground. I find it hard not to be happy here!"
I love going to this place on Sundays to dance to the beats and rhythms and enjoy all the goodies of the market.
"Great vibes, awesome spot for a picnic with friends or to throw around a frisbee"
Really great parc in the city.
Put this place on your visit early in the morning after breakfast or brunch. Simply beautiful and relaxing. Very close to Mount Royal. Across the road. This should be your next visit!
Tons of cool things for kids of all ages to do.
"Nice park for a walk, hike, bike ride or BBQ. Parking is scarce."
"Beautiful place, lovely colours at this time year"
Nice place to hang out and have a picnic. Join in dancing and playing tamtams on Sundays.
"We walked around the park because it was part of the walking tour with the Museum of Montreal Jewish called ""In the Shadow of the Mountain."". Even in this heat, there were people enjoying themselves.  Great historical significance.  Nice place to hang out with family and friends!"
Always an amazing place to relax and people watch. Montreal vibe.
Can't wait for the football field to reopen for Sun Youth Hornets practices!
"The bagels are made fresh, even as you order. There is no place to eat, so order and go. They have a nice variety of bagel selections, and the workers were very courteous. Great bagels too! Delicious!"
Lovely park near Mount Royal with Playground for sports
lovely park
"Mt Royal monument. On Sunday's everyone gets together for tam tam. People bring their various instruments. Drums, flute, whistles, tambourines, guitar, harmonica whatever your musical taste is. Everyone is welcome to join in the musical festivities. Meet your friends and meet new people. A time to be had by all. Starts around noon , ends around 10 pm."
Pretty cute
Great playground. One of the best
"I grew up around this park. It‚Äôs got a pool for small children (though be careful because they can easily scrape themselves on the pool floor), two parks (one for big kids, one for smaller kids), a soccer field, tennis courts and a lot of lounging area. It was actually designed by the same guy who designed Central Park. The setting and vibe is super chill, a tranquil green park in the middle of the hectic city."
"Beautiful place, my wife and I loved this place!"
Full of people during the pandemic
"A very beautiful place for relaxing. A lot of green areas, baseball and tennis courts, children areas, bicycle paths and jogging trails, benches with tables, and outstanding maintenance. The play areas for children are safe and well designed, offering intensive entertainment to kids of all ages. There is a separated area for children until 5 years old and other for older kids."
"Went to climate strike Montreal. Wonderful day, 500,000 attended."
Great park in montreal lot of space
Nice place
Nice park
"Nice park with an awesome view on Mount-Royal and Downtown Montreal. Great place for a picnic with friends or for a game of SpikeBall! There are also lots of sports fields where you can play soccer, tennis and volleyball. I go there to play beach volleyball, but for a fee. The field is open from noon until sunset, and it's 10$ for the day. There are also different membership options for the whole summer. Only thing is, it's hard to find a washroom, but there's a place near the field where you can wash your feet when you're done."
A really relaxing place with a lot of things to do
park right across from the mountain. tennis and baseball as well as picnic areas.
Beautiful park in summer or winter
Amazing park for kids and the hike near by the Mount .

Fun park in the Plateau
Something for everyone. Public washrooms.

"Lots of benches,  clean,  tennis court,  volleyball court,  lots of open space to picnic, however not many trees (shade)."
It's a relaxing place ever
Good park to take a break after walking so much. Nice monument to Sir George Etiene Cartier and nice place to chill and enjoy the nature around you.
Love it... always.
"Kind of crowded, but good for families, I suppose. Skip going on Sunday."
Freedom of expression is a great thing! Drop by for Tams and you won't regret it.
Amazinf ambiance and great place to rest mid bike ride!!
It is small but it is beautiful
Pretty and there was social distancing
Amazing place for a picnic and catch-up with friends!!! üòÉ
It's always a good place to be .
just a big park what's not to love
Best place to hang out and play
"I love this place. Unique, Montreal summer Sunday afternoon. Musicians dig out their instruments and gather around the statue to play. You can dance, you buy hippy things, or just lay down in the grass. A bit further into the woods, there's medieval play and acrobatics... The croud is very eclectic."
Full of young people.
Freeeeeezbeeeeeee
Great lighting and it's great for sports and yoga
The kids playground is amazing
Awesome
Love this Park.
One of the best parks in Montr√©al for kids and adults
It's one of my favourites
"This was a lovely day for an Indian festival. The whole event was an explosion for the senses: the colours, the aromas, the dancers and music and the informative kiosks.
I ly downside, the henna did not even make the trip home."
Beautiful view of the city
"Great place to jog, climb or stroll with a friend. Nice trails. Excellent place to get away from the agressive city. Superb in winter too!"
I got there to get wasted and tell stories with my friends.
"Beautiful, always filled with loving people. Sundays are awesome, there's tamtams. Best place to light a j and relax!"
"Nice and large, with flat green to lay down and trees to take shadow cover, right next to Mont Royal, and with many buses access. A great place !"
Magical in winter!
Jeanne-Mance Park
great parc    espicially in summer  evry sunday  tam tams  jam
Awesome üëå
Great parc to hang out with lots of activity
"good parc. lots of sports. good trees to lean against. bike paths, watch yourself."
Great walks here! Amazing view of the city
Nice park. Lots of people. Scuzzy bathroom. Good statue.
A bit crowded but very lovely
"Large open area, good for dog walks or jogging. Close to many neat spots to eat."
Beautiful park with all the typical amenities. Lots of free space to lounge or enjoy a picnic
"Great park to just chill in, grassy hills, picnic tables & benches, children's play structure, volley ball courts & other sports, lots of good dogs"
"Nice expansive park located right by downtown Montreal.  Soccer fields, volley ball sand courts, playgrounds and plenty of green space to stretch out and relax."
"Great place summer time - walking, running, staying in the shade, but it's not too far from city noise :) Not too many places like this downtown - green, well maintained and (mostly) clean, but better cross the street and enjoy Mt Royal trails. BBQ and playground for kids, dogs are welcome too."
Crowded! :)
It's okay. There's a lot going on here. It would be nice if the fields were less rocky and had less holes. It's pretty dangerous.
Large park where everyone comes to take rest
I love waking there...
"Great to hang out, grab some sun, enjoy the summer.  Whether you are local or visitor you'll definitely enjoy your time spent there"
Very small park. It should qualify as someone's garden.
Lots of space for 2 meters apart.
"It's huge as it's spread on both sides of the road. The biggest negative I find is that there is a lot of noise and people do a lot of drugs there (although I still felt safe with my kid). There is a swimming pool (sorta), lots of options for kids of all ages (the most I have ever seen in any park). It is also very convenient located, as it's closer to a metro station and bus stops. You can go to the top of the mountain from here."
Make sure your dog doesn't run away
Nice park. Dog friendly. With kids playground
"Empty the winter and filled up the summer, pretty clean and overall a good place to hang out play cards or whatever you're into."
"Lovely park, lots of open space. Needs an actual dog park"
Nice place and playground üôÇ
Plenty of good looking plateau people.
"Lots going on in Jean mance park... From beach volleyball and tennis to Tam Tam and ultimate Frisbee pickup games... You can bbq, picnic, have a birthday party, bike, run, just hang.... It's also in a very convenient location... Near bars, restaurants, coffee shops, bus stops, metro

I believe it technically it's at the intersection of plateau and Outremont.."
One of the best park in city. It is very well maintained!
Beautiful autumn scenery
"There's a soccer field, tennis fields and a playground. However, for dog owners its a pain in the butt. There's a dog park that is not fenced and has restricted times. You can easily get a ticket there if your dog is not wearing the tag, you are using the dog park between 8 am and 8pm, or if your leash is too long. Also even though pets are allowed there, people is very rude about it and you can't relax in this park with your dog without having animal patrol frequently coming to check on you. Very annoying.

If you don't have a pet, its a great place. Apparently BBQing here is allowed."
Put this place on your early morning visit after breakfast or brunch. Simply beautiful and relaxing. Very near to Mont Royal. Across the road. That should be your next visit!
Since there are sooo many off leash dogs here might as well add a dog park( huge empty space on the corner of Park ave/ Mount Royal. The kids park is great too enclosed and plenty of sand to play with but no baby swings in the toddler area ü§ê
Very nice park. Fresh air in the middle of the city. Very nice.
"Nice park, I have work meetings there, sometimes a cat comes to see you to get pet"
Beautiful park to walk through or hang out.
Great place to play tennis or take a walk with the dog
"Don't be lazy walk to the top of the mountain to see the magnificent view.   Visit the Chalet, you can literally walk the circumference of the city on the top of the mountain and the view is nice.    I love to go on nature walks here.   There is a forest in the middle of the metropolis.   I find it rewarding to climb to the top it a victorious feeling even though this isn't the biggest mountain the climb in the world."
"Beautiful pa k, across the street (ave du Parc) from Mont Royal. Great place to go to relax, walk your dog, suntan, or enjoy a picnic. Lots of trees and open spaces. The park also has several outdoor  volleyball courts on sand, as well as soccer and football courts there is even a small enclosed killing ds park with swings and slides etc.  There's even a wading pool for the kids to cool off In on hot summer days."
Good park and it was a wonderfull experience in the park
Always fun relaxing enjoyable so much place for families to picnic in the sun or shade
"A wonderful park just across Park Avenue from the Mont Royal.  It has several play structure areas according to age, including lovely metal chimes to play and a water table.  Public restrooms, large playing fields and regular visits by the ice cream truck.
This park is located next to the Mile End and the Plateau Mont Royal, two wonderful neighborhoods."
Too open
"Beautiful park at the foothill of Mount Royal. Great big trees.
Tres beau parc au pied du Mont Royal"
Fun place for outdoor activities. May get busy on weekends and holidays during the summer.

"Nice park for walking your dog, just east of Mont Royal park, picnic tables, and quite a few volleyball facilities, not far from very popular Santropol restaurant on St Urbain"
"Loved the cherry blossoms and lush green areas, tam tams added so much fun to the place."
Decent park to hang out on a nice sunny day. Fills up quickly on weekends!
This park has it all
V.good
A park with four lanes of traffic running through it isn't really a park but an afterthought.
Excelent for rest
"Very green on the bottom, blue on top (most of the time), trees on the sides, perfect for Frisbee - would go again"
It's good for exercise
Enjoy time alone or with friends. Jeanne-Mance is delightful.
"The crowd was very peaceful and the weather was perfect
It was for a good cauy"
The view is amazing
"Grass, soccer field, free places, picnic tables: everything to make everyone happy. On top of it is quiet (depending on the event) and very secure (a lot of policemen biking around). View on Mont Royal and typical old Montreal houses, worth stopping by for a quick bite and a drink."
Nice out door for family & friends.My two kids really loved this park.
It's good and huge. I went there for a event it's nice.
Wonderful park with facilities and eating areas. Great equipment for kids.
Great place to warm up jogging before going up to the mountain lol! They have also a great area for kiddos!
Very beautiful.  Easy to get to. Nice walk.
"If you like parks, it's a great one. A lot of space, a nice view on the mountain and the city, tennis courts, good location and a nice playground for kids. Grab coffee at Cafe Plume and head to the park."
"Great playground for kids. There's a side for older and a fenced side for younger kids. Lots of local parents hang out here before dinnertime with kids of all ages. The park includes rope structures, giant music instruments, a sandbox, a water system, picnic tables, and much more. There's even a park public bathroom in the building beside it."
"This is a great park that is right across from the Mont Royal. It has beach voleyball courts and lots of green space. There is a kids section that has recently been refurbished and it has the most coolest games that could think of. You can hang out here or if you feel like doing some exercise, just cross the street and hike Mont Royal."
Nice wide open space. Went here for Tam Tams a couple of times.
"Our favourite hangout in the entire city. Bring your own empanadas from La Chilenita, burgers and fries from Patati Patata or roasted chicken from Romados and spend the entire afternoon here."
Yes 4.5
"Got drunk here a few times, it was beautiful. I also seen Jesus and Captain Sparrow taking pictures together - whatta a time to be alive."
"Silent & calm park, at least the time I went there. It's a good picnic spot"
Excellent place to be with friends and family.
"Its a multipurpose park for most outdoor activities like soccer, volleyball, frisbee, or other sports. And also a really nice and quiest place to have bbq, picnic or just hangout."
My favorite place to recharge
I didn‚Äôt spend much time there as that was the starting point of Tour de L‚Äô√Æle biking event. It looks like a regular parc.
Huge & vast. Many sports possible. On a sunny day a semi paradise. Fresh air. Flowers. Nature. Trees  pool for kids. Mountain nearby. Walk.run.bike.sit.sleep.jump.yoga.lovely.refresh oxygen.tam tam nearby.see pics on site. A Montreal oasis. Good to know it exists! to top it all name and nurse Jean mance a woman who dedicated her life to founding Montreal hotel dieu first hospital in the city! Excellent to relax!
This is a nice park. There is a nice little area for kids.
A beautiful park .full of green.childrens play area is also there.
"Definitely a wonderful place to walk through and enjoy a nice day. There are volleyball courts there as well to enjoy, however, they are way overpriced for even an hour of play."
Very beautiful park
It's an open space where u can relax with loved ones
"Really great park, one of the best parks, I must say. However, the service is quite slow. I waited at the picnic table for about six hours before a waiter showed up, and I'm not  entirely convinced they were being honest with me..."
"Active during summer months...Sundays is tam tam day where people with jembes get together to make music ...vendors onsite.. there's a children play ground .. practice fields for football, soccer,vollyball, frisbee or just for picnic with friends, family.. public toilets available also...a view of mont Royal with a walkpath all the way to the top..."
"This is where Tam-Tam is held on Sundays! Bring your cooler or small bbq and have a blast.
Bring disinfecting wipes and toilet paper, because you will need them when you use the üöª bathroom! (Bathrooms are across the street under the stairs)"
A beautiful staple of the city where people of all kinds gather.

Tam Tam mon amour! Merveilleux !

Bien avec de l'ombre
Sick spot pour chill
"Parc F√©lix-Antoine-Savard is a small neighborhood park that happens to have a basketball hoop which is popular with residents. It could get noisy, so if you require a quieter setting, just walk down the block for a couple of similar public spaces minus the hoop. At the southern edge of the park, there's a huge mural that will impress you with its quality."
"Small park with two game modules, a water play area shaped as an old ship (masts and front statue added), some tables for picnic and restroom facilities. Quiet area with some trees for shade."
"Great park but couldn't find the golden ship anywhere, 5 stars anyway"
Nice parc there's a volleyball pitch also
"Generally, Montreal is well served of parks like this. Most of them are fun enough with their 2 modules, water games and restrooms. This park is one of those. It has a fun treasure hunt game in the 5-years module. The restrooms used to have unholy opening hours, but they were extended recently. The only thing missing is more sitting spaces under shade close to the modules."
Nice
"Super park, very calm, not crowded and very good for children"
Perfect for children. Nice place to enjoy with them.
"Very nice, clean, parking available"
Wish there was more places with shade.
A walk in the park.
Very nice park!
Very nice.
Clean place.
Nice and quiet place
"Vraiment bon parc pour les enfants! Il y a beaucoup de jeux tr√®s amusants!
On y retrouve aussi un terrain de volleyball et un espace d'entra√Ænement musculaire!"
Assez de base
Very little items and could use a fresh coat of paint
It's  cool place to go play basketball
"Playground structure, quality and style very poor"
Great playground for the kiddies.....
It was fun
"How can I not love my local park? Survived a microblast a few years ago but rose from the dead. Cool skater culture complete with fumesü§™, kids cool off in sprinklers and play on playground equipment. Impromptu softball games, family gatherings, picnics with Gen Z's with cool tats, hair, and sexualities, and old white and Rastamen finally united by old age. Shakespeare in the summer, cross country skiing in winter."
It's very good place to play my young kids.
"I went to the dog park, which was very spacious. Also had a smaller dog park that can also be opened to the main one. It has chairs, large tree trunk for the adventurous dog to climb on. Many objects in the enclosure. It's not just a sandbox. More than one entrances which is great. Love this dog park. Very fun for the furry friends and their owners."
"Gorgeous park with plenty of grass space, benches and greenery. Also very clean! Great place to hang out."
The city of making many improvements to this park. The new chalet  Area is really nice. It's too bad that they lost all of trees in the storm.  Love the dog park.
"Very nice park. It seems to have recovered nicely from that storm that took down many of their big trees. It has a lovely monument for veteran, a dog park, a children's play area with splash pad. Two large grass areas for sports and skating in the winter. A general park space with lots of benches and even some exercise equipment. And free wi-fi."
"A tiny bit dirty. Very open, spacious, and loaded with many playgrounds."
"Take a walk, enjoy your moment and relax. It's a good place to do so."
Nice park with lots of opportunities for kids. Also has restrooms.
"Awesome park so much space so much to do. Basketball courts, soccer field, table tennis"
"One of my favourite parks, just not easy to walk in winter"
Great park for everybody plenty of place to sit
"It's a quiet place but also you can meet friends , friends with dogs as well ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Right in the heart of NDG is this beautiful little patch of green. It includes a children's park with water splashing, dog park, an skating area, baseball field and lots of grass to lay on. Washroom facilities are on site, and in winter they host a nice hockey skating rink.  Enjoy."
Cool park alot of open space
"Big, beautiful park. Lots of cafes and restaurants close by. Off-leash dog park, playground, exercise equipment, always people doing yoga and tai chi and having picnics. Baseball, buskers, free wifi, and public restrooms."
Great park. Was a beautiful day to take my dog to the dog park. Lots of very nice and friendly people. I live this park...
Green. Grass. Clean. Lovely people.
Great park great sledding in the winter! Dog run!
Beautiful park . Nice for grounding .
"Beautiful, clean and busy with families"
"Has all the fixings of a good park. It was recently renovated and they redid all the stone work after a storm destroyed some of the parks older trees. It has a dog park, and a kids park and a small place to skate. There are some benches and nice grassy areas."
"Lovely park even with the loss, to a stormy cloud burst, of the green cathedral of old trees along Sherbrooke."
"Dog run recently renovated - large, clean but a lot of sand so it's difficult for the dogs to run & play.
Overall a very clean & well maintained park with a newly renovated chalet with a large handicap accessible washroom."
Dogs love snow
Excellent park . My kids love the splash pad I enjoy  bringing  my dog üêï to the dog park
"Very nice park inside a busy city
This is a large park occupying a good sized block in a very busy section of Montreal.  There is enough room for a quiet oasis from to hectic pace around it, a dog run, two children's play grounds to cover all ages as well sports fields. It includes a small community building with washrooms.  Accessible by bus. There is some on-street parking."
"Beautiful park. Lots of space for kids. Waterpark . Lots of trees for shade.  Unfortunately the washrooms are closed due to covid19.  Still, a relaxing environment."
"A very good park, I used to go there everyday before pandemic"
"Great park with room to skate for those that like to skate board, splash park, lot of room to sit and relax with a good book or enjoy a pleasant conversation with a friend. Not to mention this park has wifi for those looking for free wifi access."
"Beautiful park!!  Big baseball field, they sometimes have movies in the park in the evenings. There is a water playground and a reasonably sized jungle gym with a sand bottom. There is a beautiful dog park renovated this year (2019). They also have have a water fountain for the dogs to drink from. LOTS OF ROOM TO LAY IN THE GRASS. ( Always look for mines before sitting ndg is VERY dog friendly"
The park is nice with internet access all over the area. Nice area to stretch your legs.
"Like all green spaces in Montreal, NDG park is well used and loved by its neighbours."
Nice park.
Cozy park along the main road of sherbrooke
Very nice park with great kids playground. I enjoy the dog park too. A must have in Montreal
"Notre Dame de Grace is a fine residential area, with some older brick houses, in streets canopied by beautiful large trees, and a few ""in"" streets for shopping and lounging in quaint cafes and authentic ethnic eateries.  A Montreal quarter with a unique character of its own. It also goes down to the part of Sherbrook street with its good stores, and restaurants.  Some of the restaurants and cafes have sidewalk seating too.  Parking might be hard to find at times.  Enjoy your visit!"
Great little park. Great area to walk your dog. There is space to let the dog run free. There is a space for children to play with bikes / skateboards. There is also lots of space to lay down a blanket and have a picnic or read a book. Good spot to enjoy the beautiful weather in the summer.
"Good for gathering  , walk and exercises easy to get there by public transit , velo or car"
Loved this place
"Puppy playground, toddler waddle area, and scampering squirrels...this park has everything for the haggard housewife."
"I had WiFi access from the Mtl open Internet network, great!.
Unfortunately, a group of pot smokers arrived and the smell was insupportable..."
"Nice park, many many activities, very good children area with fence"
Very nice park with playground and green space. Can bring kids here it have a picnic. Lots of restaurants around and easy to get here by public transportion. Recommend for visits in the summer when looking for a way to spend the afternoon. Highly recommend.
Nice place to chill and have a beer or 5.
"Nice playgrounds, one for small kids and one for bigger kids.  Chalet with toilet and indoors space really convenient.  Water park in summer and ice skating in winter.  Great park!"
"Nicely refurbished playground, mini water park for young children, newly planted trees to replace those lost during the storm. Cenotaph refurbished, very classy job! Dog run being redone summer 2019."
"A nice green spot taking the entire urban block between Girouard and Marcil, Sherbrooke and Cote-Saint-Antoine, is under a very heavy recreational pressure these days and worsening, but it used to be much more quiet. Too many people and dogs per square inch!"
There is a space for everyone. Even the furry ones.
Lots of room for activity and a lot of life
"Big park with lots of installation for toddlers, clean ,spacious, great place to have a piknik ."
Very nice place.
I LOVE this park! It's such a nice place to go with friends or family. The dog park is wonderful; I go there weekly with my labrador. There's also free wifi (yay!).
The place is very quiet and peaceful.We had a great time!
if you get there early enough it is very quiet.
Nice place to spend your time
Very clean and calm place!
Great place to relax.
An awesome park for the entire family. The splash park section for the children is excellent. The shear size of this space is a welcome green space in this concrete jungle.
My childhood park. The loss of the trees during a freak storm has been well dealt with. Nice place in the center of NDG.
beautiful park parts of it were decimated by the tornado we had a couple of years ago they have replanted replenished redone the dog run it's beautiful
Would love to have the chalet open on time every day as well as have the sand changed in the kids park. Been years since that happened. Otherwise a fun park for picnicking and playing with the family.
Nice attractive park un Summertime
Nice looking park. Not impressed at all by seeing young bums climbing all over the War Memorial as well as dealing with skate boarders farting around when they should be somewhere working and paying taxes like most of us. Where was security? Never ever saw one there patrolling at any time.
"Great park. Dog runs, softball field and lots of space and shade."
"Great park for grown-ups, children AND dogs. With Bixi stations during spring, summer and fall. It has a fenced dog area and a fenced children's area too. There a pleasant paths with a few remaining trees from last year's microburst that brought some down and it also has a softball field that has a skating rink installed during winter, the chalet hosts bathrooms and public common sheltered areas. This is a pretty nice Park!"
great place to have a rest. Quiet and good management
"This park is also full of big old trees spaced attractively, a dog park is fenced in and frequently visited where dog lovers and dogs can connect with old friends and new, a fine water park and picnic tables make for a lot of family fun in Summer. In Winter the ice skating is great fun for everyone, night and day.
The sloping ground from the main red brick chalet makes for a very pleasant vantage point to people- watch the pedestrians on Sherbrooke Street. So many come to the park with a blanket to sit and dream as the clouds pass over the tall trees. Squirrels love it too. As do dogs of various sizes as long as they are on a leash. Dogs can run free in the fenced in dog park.
Most importantly, the park is now home to The Vimy Ridge Monument as of 2017.
Where it is placed prominently at the mouth of the park facing Sherbrooke Street, it is called Place Vimy.

This park is where great memories are made."
I love to go for a walk with my whole class from Forward House!
Great neighborhood park.
Been going to this park all year round. Nice place to workout or sit and relax and reflect life.  Wish there were more workout installations.
"NDG Park is one of the better green spaces in NDG. It covers a large area and is great for people of all sorts - families, couples, groups, and individuals. If you need a quiet corner, it's easy to find and if you're looking for some socializing there are plenty of people just hanging out. Large trees, shade, well balanced with other large open areas. There's a kiddie area with plenty of swings etc. and a water playground for hot summer days. In the winter, there's an outdoor hockey rink that the city sets up.There also is an enclosed dog area that is large and dogs can roam free and play with other doggies. There's a subsection to keep the smaller dogs away from the big ones."
A beautiful park in NDG neighborhood.
Nice looking park perfect place for you to be with your friends and relax
"Love to feed the squirrels here. After the big storm, the park is not so nice without the large trees that were destroyed. But that's nature..."
They have a very nice and newly renovated dog park!
"Good place to chill or have some rest, very quiet and beautiful"
It's a nice small park right on Sherbrooke. Popular spot in the neighborhood.
"Love this park! Quite big, but i usually just hang near the doggies park. :) full of squirrels and a nice atmosphere"
Micro burst tree devastation
Nice and relatively clean
"Public park with free access, lots of space to walk, run, play, or relax. Has play area for younger children. Great location if can find street parking by meter."
Was Awesome
"Our go-to spot (especially in summer) to picnic, sit out and read a book, enjoy a bit of greenery etc"
"I love our NDG park. It's always clean and well maintained, has great people and lots of events. The dogs love it too :)"
It is ok. not very big.
"Beautiful and very quiet place to relax, do some meditation, take the sun, read a book, walk your dog and even have picnic.
It has internet conection to work or just enjoy yourself"
Plenty of space for kids to play.
The splashpad is a great place to take the kids to cool off on a hot day. Play structures available for all age groups. Just a nice park to sit and have a picnic with friends. Washrooms are available as well.
Lots of greenspace; swings and play park for children; new trees - nicely manicured.
Lovely park.
This is a great place to chill out!
Lovely place where you can find self rest.
"Structures for big kids and small, sprinklers, and plenty of room for a picnic.  Bathrooms and water fountains. Dog run too."
"Newly renewed park, got free WiFi.. Never seen that before. Very nice area"
"Great ambiance and size! There is free Wi-Fi available for public use while in the park, as well as a lot of amenities. Skating rinks in the winter, soccer and baseball fields in the summer, lots of green space. There is even two dog parks (one for big dogs, and one for little), so even furry friends can have fun here!"
Great NDG park
"Since the storm destroyed so many trees in this park, the city has made huge improvements to it and it's chalet!  It's not quite finished but a fabulous transition!"
"Something for everyone! Splash pad, 2 playgrounds, a dog park, and wide open grassy space with old trees, perfect for picnics, exercise, meditation, walks, or a nap in the sun."
Very nice park hut it was better to have a swimming pool too.
Love the two kids' play areas and the dog park. Sprinkler park needs a better lock on the gate.
Small . Clean and neat . Needs a little love
Great park for all sorts of activities
"Pro: excellent park. Lots of good areas for small kids. [~2y]
Con: couldn't get the free wifi working"
"Nice open area
Big play area
Clean
Ppl r friendly"
Local park great for relaxing or dog walking and bringing the kids.
I like that there's running water available to keep the dogs hydrated. .. the lack of grass and complete dirt park  for the dogs makes for a messy park experience on wet days.
"Love the park and the fact that it has a dog run, although the dog run could use some inexpensive improvements."
Awsome place for picnics and a day out can spend hours here there is a church close by
Great park. Fun for kids. Great place for a picnic
Place looks great.. Even has a water park for young kids
Beautiful clean and many things to do
Great place for families!
"Beautiful urban park with skating rink, baseball diamond, kids play area, dog run,  free WiFi."
"It is a beautiful and relaxing park with  a recently renovated dog park, a small water park and a playground for kids, which are now open. Sometimes atmosphere feels like Woodstock. Before the freak microbursting  windstorm of August 22nd, 2017, there were lots of old trees but they did do a nice job making the park beautiful again. Having a play in the park was a good idea, and has become a pleasant but distant memory of the old days. Considering many people in this neighborhood don't have backyards or balconies, going to a park is crucial for their well being, especially when so much has been stopped and may not restart as expected or promised. One thing missing in this park is an official skateboard area/rink so there is a lot of random skateboarding going on sometimes even on the cenotaph and obstructing the walking area around the cenotaph. Sometimes the distancing rules are not remembered and some boarders wiz by other park goers within inches so there is a potential for a future accident waiting to happen, IMO. You also have to keep an eye on the path when walking because, like most of Montreal there are a lot of  pot holes, skateboarders whizzing by and people who stand in the path talking to each other 6 feet apart  so you have to walk around them. Sometimes not much respect for social distancing and a small number of  frisbee throwers, not  wearing masks, tend to be inconsiderate of others sitting on benches, while apologizing every time they almost hit them with a possibly contaminated frisbee, sometimes crawling under the bench the person is sitting on to retrieve the possibly contaminated frisbee, so only safe option is to find another bench. Similar with taking a bus nearby. An unmasked person putting their hands on the back of your seat  gives you  no other safe option but to find another seat, cause someone saying that they are sorry while they are possibly spreading, instead of trying to prevent the spreading and the fear of spreading Covid-19 to possibly vulnerable people is not enough IMO & rather stupid if not hypocritical. We have gone through all this for 3 months, putting millions out of work & many businesses could go bankrupt, to prevent spread of Covid-19, so an umasked stranger can whimsically throw a possibly contaminated frisbee so another can  crawl under your bench to retrieve it. For a moment a beautiful park feels like a sad place to be."
"Plenty of stuff to do wether it's watching doggos üêï, playing frisbee or taking your kids out at the water park!"
A nice place for small children. Good splash park.
Good vibe generally with lots of possible activities. It also has a dog park.
Nice park . Lots of activities such as movie night etc during the summer
Great place to walk your dog and let them run free in the dog park.
Terrific park. With an outdoor ice rink in the winter and concerts and splash zone for the kids!
"Quite the lovely park. You'll see a lot of squirrels, kids and dogs."
"Good park on a busy street , Aloooot of stoners and drinkers and Dogs and ppl soing random shiit"
Great park! Wi-Fi available for free
Great spot for the kiddos to play
Great place for seating on an evening of summer

"Un grand parc avec WiFi public.
Enfants et parents y trouvent leur compte en √©t√© tout comme en hiver!"
It is a rink in winter. Summer it is a football field. Also contains a tennis court and a playground which is adequate.
"Great place for free skating with kids. They even turn the lights on in the evening. 2 ice rinks, connected. One suitable for hockey, one just for fun!"
We've been there for ice skating in winter. You will hardly find anyone there during winter. We love there...
It is a nice park where you can enjoy with your family your time
It was lit the lights were off but didn't stop me and my friends to have the rink to ourselves

From What I see it's well cept. & Clean.
"Good parc, there was pizza"
Cool
Funny
Great place to go camping!
Very nice entry point to the popular Park Visitation.   Bike and walkable path starts here.  Nice kiddy area and Summertime stage for ongoing cultural shows.  Parking to be found around some of the residential streets.  Note: I placed a photo for the opening hours of the public toilet.
"Large park near a school which is great after studying (or you can study there on a table). They got sport machines outside. A lake near to fish, with a track for bicycles and scooters. Just watch out because you can fall. There's a tall balcony there to watch the water run and then just relax. You can also get food/drinks from the nearby restaurants/shops. You sit on a rock, close your eyes and relax. Take a deep breath then listen to the water run. Only silence, which is relaxing. It is also safe, don't worry. There's security guards on patrol there, so don't be afraid. Very good to study, relax, ride a bike or just run. The picture below is the scenery at night time. Magnificent."
One of my son‚Äôs fav parks :)
It's a little parc where you can seat on the bench and talk or have a little play with your kids. There's some playground and the view is not too bad.
"Love running here along the water. It's an almost all dirt trail, so great for the knees! There are also a lot of trees for shade while running, benches, bike trail, a couple water fountains and an area with some exercise equipment and a small playground for kids!!"
Nice little park.
Good for Summer time
Id√©al pour se promener √† pied ou faire du v√©lo le long de la rivi√®re
Good park
Good spot to relax and have a nice view of canal Lachine or play ping pong.
"Cute park along the canal. Great for picnics, a bike ride or a walk. Right next to Atwater market so in the summer you can go grab some food and drinks to enjoy under the trees. You can rent bikes right there at Ma Bicyclette."
Love this place. The view is mesmerizing and the place is quiet and calm.
Beautiful little park close to the canal. Ma bicyclette with refreshments and the boating rental a few minute walk away üôÇ A lot of dogs though..watch wear you step/sit üòÜ
Good spot to rest when  traveling down the canal. Steven have ping pong tables
"I think this might be one of my favorite parks. It has an enormous area of grass, perfect for kids to  play and run around, not to mention there a path going around that plot of grass, showing a magnificent view of the water. To add to that, the sunsets are even more beautiful. There are a few benches and large swings you can relax on while appreciating the scenery."
Absolutely beautiful! I made friends by the water. Such an amazing ambiance
Very nice stretch of the lachine canal bike path. More quiet and less crowded than some of the more easternmost points. There's is a dock to launch a Kayak or canoe.  Paid parking on site but there is also free parking on nearby streets. Some accessible shoreline for fishing. Nice views.
"Great park to go for a walk, jog, picnic, some icecream at dairy queens. Many things to see wildlife and wind surfers! Get some sun and enjoy the outdoors!"
"One our favorite places to put our kayaks into the water and go for a nice ride on the river, Even though the water is a bit rough but still is a good place for people who enjoy being  on the water ..."
"Lovely place to go relax and enjoy the lake, or take a walk/ride."
Nice spot along the river. Picnic tables and benches. Paid parking.
People who live this area are very lucky! Beautiful place and kid loves it!
Nice and cool environment to relax and have fun with the family
"Man, went there on Wednesday and was amazed. I loved the atmosphere, I loved the scenery and I loved how you can just use the bench as a stretching tool after a long walk or a bike ride, they even have instructions available so you know what you're doing, loved that. (don't forget to remember to wash your hands before and after, guidelines for everyone's safety in these times). You can also relax by the water, there's even a lighthouse as well!"
"Beautiful spot for family gatherings or a walk in the park with your dog. Lounge chairs and picnic tables newly installed last year...the whole coastline of Pointe Claire,  Dorval, Lachine, LaSalle and Verdun are spectacular!!!"
Beautiful place to have a picnic and spend the day relaxing by the water. Peace out and pay it forward everyone.
"Beautiful park to stroll along on the lake. Reminds me of the seawall in Vancouver, and Bellevue Park in Sault Ste. Marie. Very lovely views, and a good sized park. Would love to go again."
Beautiful Parc that runs along the St Lawrence River. Nice family area as well with benches and picnic tables to enjoy a beautiful summer's day!
"Our ""Go To"" park for a nice picnic ... WITH our dog ;-)"
"Sitting by the water there is amazing, extremely peaceful"
"If you live outside of Lachine, You might not know that there are some beautiful spots like this. You still have the noise from the traffic on St Joseph boulevard but this is still a great place for a stroll."
"Great park in the west island..loved the idea not having to go find parking elsewhere. However, some people play their music too loud!"
A beautiful lakeside park for which local residents and visitors alike owe a huge debt of gratitude to the foresight of previous generations of civic-minded Lachine leaders.
A nice place just needs a public washroom and a shed in case of rain.
Beautiful walk any season!
Beautiful place to walk along the water
A little piece of tranquility.
So peaceful and lovely wish I had a chance to stay and relax

Very nice and clean park
Waterfront picnic area is lovely
"Nice park. Spot to get to the water with your kayak, Paddle board or others"
"One of my favorite parks. Biking pass that goes along the water makes this park into a great place for mini trips with your partner, friend or by yourself, giving you the space to think about whatever you feel is important.  Prefect place for morning or evening jug.  Or just watching a moon in the river.  In the winter perfect place for all the winter games."
"Nature walk or a bike ride, great place to spend the day"
Beautiful park. Great place for people watching and relaxing.
That place is gorgeous. I really like to got walk on they path along the shoreline. The vista is always amazing.
Nice area to walk around or sunbathe.
"There is a park after park all the way to the marina and one of the locks on the Lachine canal. There is restaurants, museums, bike paths and they are all connected for many kilometers. This is a very nice area to spend a summer's day."
Very beautiful park with an amazing view of the Saint Lawrence River.
Take relaxing stroll next to the st-lawrence
"A good place to relax, walk run bike or boating."
"Quiet and serene, right by the water. It's an excellent place to enjoy what little nature big cities afford us."
One of the great place
Beautiful spot to unwind & relax!
Lachine's best
Superb location....good vacation spot
Located off Lac St Louis. This parc gives you a panoramic view of the water and downtown. There is a bike path as well as a walking path. Ideal place to take a stroll or just enjoy the view and calmness.
Nice place to enjoy the view of the outdoors and river. Runs along the cycling path.
Amazing hidden away park. Beautiful nature
"Very nice parc, clean, plenty of space and a great view on st laurent River."
Spectacular to have a long strip of park with nice views on a crowded island!
Nice place to visit by the Lachine canal water. Perfect for a pic-nic day.
Beautiful views of the St-Laurence Lake
"Great place for walk, biking or jogging."

Very little
Quiet park for relaxation just in front of the river.
Beautiful place for a quiet walk
Very nice parc with trees and close to the water...
Great stop on a stroll along the water.
Great views of the river.
Lots of broken bottles and caps. Don't bring kids around here.
Ft
The sunset is just amazing with a joint
"Un chemin agr√©able, r√©cemment refait, permet de faire une marche en longeant la berge. Mais il est expos√© au soleil, sans ombrage."
Very safe and user friendly.
A cozy park with lots of fun equipment for little ones to have fun. Best is it has fences around it so they don‚Äôt run into the nearby streets.
Plenty of space and fun equipment!
There is a pokestop there. Small park with few features. Its nice.
"Usually not very crowded, great place for kids aged 2 to 6"
"Nice neighborhood park for kids. Lots of items to climb on, swing on, hang on and run around on."
"Small and cozy park, good place for kids"
Small park good for little kids five and under

Love it here. Kids love this park
"One of the climbers is damaged upon my visit on the 18th of April 2017, I'll follow it up in a week just to update my review, but still a nice park"
Perfect place for children.
Missing rides...
Nice
Nice park in the neighborhood.
Great place
It's a nice spot in summer
Beautiful park. The bathrooms were open so that was great.
Great park!! I go every day with this little guy
"The courts here were where I won my first match, this place has a lot of history for me."
"Great soccer, baseball and tennis facilities. Well kept and maintained. The bigger park used to be better but still ok for kids. Watch out for swings, if rusty they can break. All the sports facilities are lots of fun!"
"Has tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a couple soccer fields, has a hockey rink in the winter. A pretty small pool next to a small playground. Average park"
Bring your kids it so cool to see them swimming in the pool.
Nice park to play with kids
"Lots of grass, it cool"
Beautiful small park.
Cool
Ok
The baseball field is great but the stands are hazardous.
It's ok.
Pool available
Super
My family loves this place. Spacious and very well equipped and maintained.
"Clean, starting to get crowded.  Have to go early to get a table to see family"
I like this park. Good place for kids and teenagers :)
I'm a basketball player and I'm happy there is alot of baskets to play you can play alone or on the full court there's also a big empty field and parks for kids
"Although a small park located on the edge of Ville-Emard, it can be a very lively and active park during the summer season, where you will find children running around in the sandbox, an old couple sitting on a bench, dog walkers playing fetch, adolescent playing a match of basketball and an occasional baseball match in the evening.
The park contains a basketball court, 2 half basketball court, a baseball field, a jungle gym with swings, a separate sandbox with a jungle gym and swings for infants, a small field and several benches.

The only drawback is the lack of public restroom, a dog park, and a weak water fountain system : (...."
A nice playground for families.
Its a park like any other. But its got a And nice view. Its a happy little neighborhood. In the winter the houses have these big blow ups and its all cheery. Best place to your kids and dogs to.
"Derelict basketball court, it has to be modernized and lights have to be installed - overall the park is not maintained"
"Amazing parc, spacialy un winter time"
Nice park
Beautiful park
Good place for spending time with children and walking with dog.

Nice park.
Great place for kids
Great softball field
'I loved it!' Said my son
"Nice place for dog's, fun fun"
"Small but lovely park. You can seat for think about life or bring your kids for the playground, enjoy some fresh air or go for a picnic. In the winter you can go for ice skating or even watch an amateur hokey game. A good place to build something with the snow."
Lovely park ! Near a river with beautiful viewpoints and not a lot of people. Nature in the city at it's best.
"There's plenty of open greenspace, a dog park in an enclosed area, and plenty of park benches and picnic tables. It is situated on a little hill that faces the sun as it slips out of the sky in the evening."
"The sprinklers are not consistent, they go on and off constantly"
Place it's generally clean and with nice views on spring and fall.
Really nice park with alot of activities for the kids.
great place for kids! and there is skating in winter and water games in summer!
Normally park
Nice place place for dogs
Awesome
Good park
Like
Nice park clean
Lots to do
Nice park for a walk
"Excellent park, quite & peaceful..."
It was very beautiful
Nice place
Beau paysage. Dans la ville mais tr√®s d√©paysant.
"Great park, but the huge amount of adult themed graffiti in the children's play area is absurd.
Also, teens smoke a lot of weed there, so if you don't want your child getting second hand high, I'd recommend going before 4pm"
The park for kids isn't well maintained
"It's a park, in the summer in beautiful weather, does anybody even ""rate"" parks? Jeez
Anything less than 5 stars would just be dishonest"
Wonderful park and great neighborhood.
"Great park! For big or small ^^ old or young, there's something for everyone. Two sets of game spaces ( one for younger kids, one for older ones), a skate park and for summer time, a small paddling. Also with two baseball fields and a petanque playing area, there really is something for all! Have fun ! ^^"
It's perfect to walk
"Nice park, two play sets for the kids, a shallow pool for the hot summer days and a decent little skatepark."
Nice pokestops
"Nice, public toilet, always good with young children."
Better for kids
"Nice Skate park, great place for kids of all ages"
Met an awesome dog named Lucas. 5/5 would visit again!
"Nice family oriented park, easy access, large amount of space, and games for bigger kids as well as small kids."
"You have a skate park,kids pool,baseball field,kids module to play in. Perfect for family activities"

Nice place
"Nice place, quite and good for kids"
Nice and relax
"This is an amazing and quiet park, we love to go there. It just need like a bit of maintenance mainly paint on the kids games. The shadows of the trees area amazing. I go often with my family and now I think we will go to do exercise."
Baseball
"Would I come back: Yes!

Value: Shady, quiet spot in the midst of the old city.

The Good: Great area to catch your breath on the picnic benches. There's also access to water and you can hear the street performers from here."
"Being the neighbor of the most famous square in Montreal is not easy. Place de la Dauversiere is ignored by most, but you shouldn't. If you are looking for a little shade and a place to relax, just a few feet away from the hustle and bustle of Place Jacques Cartier, this public garden will do just fine. The garden contains the statue of Jean Drapeau, the most famous local mayor in the modern history of Montreal. Mr. Drapeau's statue is strategically placed in the square that is right in front of city hall."
Breath-taking architecture... Just wonderful.
"Nice place, very busy"
This is a small park with a view of city hall.
Great family area
nice place inside the old Montreal; view on the town hall; there are a lot of small restaurants where to eat
Great historical place to visit
It was ok
Bellisimo
Right across Montreal's Cit Hall in the heart of old Montreal. Common meeting place for City Tours.
"Its a good and nice park,but the swimming place is not open yet"
Legal street art wall!
"I sometimes go there to get some peace and quiet, cool place but then school finishes, students like to  go there so I usually leave before school finishes"
Memories in Lachine with my 3 kid's here on Duff Court at the park; took my kids to the park EVERY TIME I had them every weekend. Amazing family time spent thereüíìüòçüíì
Has alot of Play structures for kids and water fountains. Has a pool and basketball courts but it's not very well kept. There was alot of garbage and broken glass on the ground.
Is a nice park for children and a relaxation place for parent. I love going there most eveningüíõüíôüíúüíöüíòüíóüíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíã.
It's so nice and cute üòç
Great Apartment big rooms but very small kitchen nice place to live.
The basketball court are good
Better than before trust me
People get rob
Good
Very clean and fun for kids
I love it
Filthy place always dirt lots of garbage
"Cozy little place, nice view"
good  entertainment  and  amusement   for  children
"Love the Charlie Brown ugly Christmas tree here.
Another community gathering place with the design of a one way street going around it, providing clean green space in an environment of surrounding buildings. Practical and effective for the residences especially in a time of pandemic, an ideal place for outdoor gathering, reducing loneliness and stress for a lot of people.Nothing is better when it is just outside your doorsteps."
Cute little park.
"Nice little park, interesting for kids that like to climb"
Small neighborhood park with a few play structures. Nice if your in the neighborhood but not really a destination
Great place to take your kids for a couple of hours. It may not be the biggest park around but kids still love it.
Quaint little parc that is near a busy street.
"A rather small park with nice installations but unfortunately met the thrashing of litterers. Hygiene varies from seasons to seasons. It got renovated around 2005-2007 and a few years later met a new friend called Kompak Box, the lovely bouldering hexagonal caterpillar wall. It has seen better days.

Pros for people seeking bodyweight fitness training:
Pull up bars, Bouldering Walls, Beams(really stretching this one but I'm talking about the fences, haha. It works though but please don't do it if you don't look like a kid.).

Pros for people who just want to take a rest for their calves: Gazebo with a table and chairs, 3 benches overall, a lot of trees covering two of the benches. Accessible neighbourhood.

Comments for family gathering: The air quality is so-so so I do not recommend picnics there... since it is near a highly active commercial street. The St-Lawrence river is better suited for this as it has actual trash bins everywhere. This one doesn't and is littered enough. No one picks their trash because there isn't a place to throw it for 10 m of distance from their bench.

Pros for children under 6: Water Playground, Safety Swings, Sandbox, Slide.

Pros for children above the age of 6 to 12: Ropes Structures, bodyweight fitness stuffs... There is seriously not a lot of things to do for the grade schoolers if not walking their dogs... Though good for hide and seek since there's a lot of trees, and they are quite dense too! And the park isn't overwhelming big so it's actually feasible to organise a game of tag.

Cons: No swings nor slides tailored for tall kids or adults, playground is mostly tailored to children from 2-6, there is only one trash bin and it is located on the rear of the park thus there is quite a respectable amount of littering. Not enough cleaning as bouldering spot is often sticky and gluey (Please stop drinking cola on the Kompak Box). No sign seen for ""illegal to smoke"" within 9 metres of a children playground. No water fountain. (There used to be one years ago when I was still a kid but it broke and never got repaired and eventually they tossed it out) Too. Much. Littering. But that is because on the other side of the park there is no garbage box. There are 4 entries to the park but the garbage bin is only attached to one of them, haha. Not to mention it's at a junction and not even visible (and it's freaking hard to reach for kids).

Nearest public restrooms are at the CLSC(5 minutes of walk), or you can try the church which is also at equal distance.

TL;dr: You will like this park either you are under the age of 6, or if you bring your friends with you and you are under the age of 12, or you're just here for pull ups and bouldering!"
"Five relative tiny corner park stars. Chill atmosphere and although there is no gate, it feels safe because it is mostly surrounded by a fence. The children's play area at least."
Great spot to bring the family.
Dirty
Correct
It was great. It's good to go to a Parc and relax.
Absolute beauty and peaceful surroundings.  Sunset is the most spectacular time of the day because the reflections off the water in addition to the ducks and Canada geese gracefully gliding and flying add to the tranquility this location has to offer.
Good place for relaxing
It unfortunately has only one bench to sit. There are however big flat boulders available in place of benches to sit and watch the river and geese.
Great little parc. Perfect for young children 10 and under. Lots of trees and shade üëç
Small park that is friendly for kids and they can cool down with the water as well.
It needs maintenance...
"Awesome, there's swimming pool in the summer and a skating space in the winter. Love it!"
"Good park
Nice playground for kids
It contains a basketball, a football and a tennis playgrounds
And there is also a swimming pool
But they aren't well guarded
The nets in the football and tennis stadium broken."
"Nice place for kids and for all. Basketball ground, 3 Tennis courts, swimming pool for adults and separate for kids.Big Kids play area."
packed during after school hours and late afternoon on weekends
"A bustling neighbourhood park, with an outdoor pool and a wading pool as well. Well managed with regards to the current situation. It's always busy with families from the neighbourhood."
"I came to this garden to get my children to swimming and while they were swim I took pictures for them and one of the rescuers came to me to talk to me in a bad way that I can't taking pictures so I told her that it is a public place and that I have the right to take pictures but she refused and spoke rudely
Please teach rescuers to focus in their work and teach them the rights of others and etiquette in public places.
The law in Canda
There is no law against¬†public¬†photography in Canada; no one here can ever be arrested for the simple act of making a picture or¬†film."
Nice park for kids to play.
Love this park .
"The park is a nice and quaint little area of Montreal, nothing more to say really."
"Secure splash pad with babies pool, and nice deep pool for adults, with rescuing team."
"It's a nice park offering different ways of having fun such as a playground, a pool, outdoor workout stations and tennis courts. Even though it's filled with unruly kids, the community reveals a special distinctiveness and liveliness unknown to other parks. You should really spend some time there and see past the kids lacking respect and the moms shouting in foreign languages."
Beautiful park with a lot of places for kids to play.
Good
Good park üëè
"Small park for neighberhood, includes a swimming pool and tennis playground"
"It's an average size park with a seperate  area for kids to enjoy swings. It has a walking track, tennis court, basket ball court, and lots of benches to sit and relax. They have recently renovate the park and install some gym accesories gor those who need to stretch a bit. I have seen people celebrating their birthdays and do small get togethers. There are 2 swimming pools one for adult and one for kids. I send my son for summer camp here which is really good and organize by some voluntary troop. They have indoor games on certain days of the week. Love it!!!"
Lot's of upgrades to the park but the amenities stay pretty empty. Except the playground!
Nice park
Painter parc filled with unruly kids and without parents supervision. Within 15min I witnessed two different groups bulling younger kids and tried to take their bikes..One kid said he was taking to bike home to give to his younger sister. If you bring your kids to this parc make sure they are accompanied by an adult.
excellent park.  very safe and appropriate for children.
"The park spacious and well-maintained, but there is little to no effort put into preventing vandalism, sexual harassment, and littering."
Beautiful park with a lot of places for kids to play.
Pretty nice park. they have lots of play areas and a pool. lots of space too to kick a ball.

very small park and not enough kids activities. Water kids activities very limited.
Love the open track and football field here.
"Very modern facility. The parks and grounds are in very good shape and very accessible.

The kid park has great units slides and other equipment. And it's well fenced-in to keep children safe.

They have a modern soccer field that diffuse for football as well. it is one of the few that actually has a shelter for the players in case of rain or too much sun. It is also fenced off with adequate height all around.

a lot of the park is still in transition so there's some construction. But it is a wonderful park."
"Great park , they have everything in terms of cardio there."
Even prettier than before. Nice upgradesüëåüèΩ
Freaking love this place
Amazing place to have family fun
One of the best skatepark in Montreal! Also a great fenced-in playground for kids so they don't come running into you! Plus there's a sports track on top of the hill.
"the renovations have completely change the ambiance of this park! lovr the results. there is a tennis or volleyball, basketball, soccer and dogs ground. plus there are water games...well theres a lot bow there! you have to check it"
Great water games for the kids
Nice park
Was hoping to use the running track. But I think they're tearing it down.

The track is going to be closed until 2020

"Free fast internet from 06h00 to 11pm, un fact i was dipped in the snow while seated on the bench. It's nice but I couldn't stay longer 1¬∞C"
"Very crowded tonight, difficult to do social distancing so we left."
For winter a small snow mountain for sliding and sledging ..summer best place and crowded
This park is beautiful and the pool is nice especially when it is hot and humid
Nice park special for baby.
Very good place for relaxation
One of the best places in Sant Luarant
Great place where kids can have fun. There is a small hill were they can roll down. And in the winter they can slide down.
It is good place to enjoy

"Evenings and weekends are full of people from many ethnicity, shows the diversity of Saint Laurent.  Great walking/jogging path, connects to Parc Cousineau"
Good for chilling
Great place to spend time playing with your children
"*** This review is only for the dog park ***
There is a dog park on the corner Poirier and Decarie.  I previously thought that this one is so-so, but after moving to West Island realised that this one is actually good.  First, it's spacious.  Second, it's grassy, so you can walk even after rain and won't mix mud.  Third, there are free poopy bags - I think it's nice, since people may forget to bring their own sometime.
There are 2 big picnic tables - not that you're going there for a picnic, but it shows that the city has provided, not the dog owners bringing their own.
Sometime when I drive by and my dog is with me, we stop there for a while."
"The park is normal but it 's so crowded and noisy with many many pique-niques, i hate it"
Such a bad park if i could give 0 stars i would do it
"Great climbing structures, multiple play areas, BBQ pits, gazebo lots of kids to play with"
No parkind

"Perfect if you want to sit quietly by the water. It's not crowded at all and it's pretty clean. But there are not a lot of options for the kids, only one game for the toddlers and one for the older kids, along with two outdated baby swings."
It is a great and quite place
Cool
Beautiful environment
Nice water front park
Wonderful place
"Beautiful, quiet park by the water"
Snow Removal is lacking during Winter.
nice place for kids... and not only
"Nice big park located in the west end of NDG. Lots of areas here to do many things (soccer & baseball fields, 2 playground areas for all ages of kids, water play area, etc.). Best is in the summer on a nice sunny day to come and play for hours! Bring a picnic. Plenty of benches to just sit and enjoy the fresh air."
"a very friendly and clean parc, we pend long time here."
The origin place of Butters the NDG Turkey! See the pics
Great park to bring your kids in this neighborhood.
"DONT DRIVE ON FIELDING, rotten road!!"
"Very nice, kids have alot of fun"
I met a couple of friends of mine and we just sat around and talked so I enjoyed it
Nothing but more and more fences being constructed everywhere
"We love Loyola Park. It's clean. A lot of garden spaces where you can easily practice distancing (2020) and do picnic. The splash pad is big and clean enough. However, just be careful by letting the kids run barefoot, it is slippery in a couple of spots.
This park has a lot of sport activities to do. It has 2 large soccer fields, 2 baseball fields, you can see some goalies around the park so you can practice with a couple of friends. It's playground is clean and large for small (with sand) and another for big kids. It has a track throughout the park. It is a cool place to spend Summer and even Fall. In Winter there's a lot of snow and I've seen some people skiing throughout the park too.
The parking is always easy and free."
Full of lil kids who bully you into giving them a place
It's nice. It's a beautiful place.
Pretty well kept park!
Lots to see if you appreciate nature
Garden with equipment games for small and medium kids.
Beautiful spacious park. Bleachers small. Bring own chair. Bathrooms not near BB field.
"Nice field, baseball park, night game also you can enjoy~ go with your kids!!"
"Lovely big park, good for biking, jogging, balls , the most important you got a bathroom"
One of the best ones aroun
The place was fun to hang around in after I was done studying
Nice big park. No dog run but plenty of open space for kids to run and play. The SW side has a nice for the younger kids and on the west side there's a water park but no pool or wading pool. Nicely kept soccer and baseball fields too.
I saw a turkey at this park so 5/5 gobbles
"Well maintained park in SW NDG. Baseball diamond, soccer fields, 2 play areas, unofficial off-leash dog-run, splash pool, quiet areas, and 2 kid's play areas. There are bathrooms near the soccer fields. Super busy on weekends and evenings with good weather as there are lots of families living in the area."
Playground for all ages and very easily accessible. The splash pad is pretty fun for kids!
Good park for the locals. Walking around the park is good.
I've been playing sports in this part since I was a kid. Over the years they've done a great job building this up this park. Looks fantastic.
Nice big park
"Large, inner city park. Field space for baseball, football, and soccer pitches. Two equipped playgrounds for younger and older children on the  south side. A spacious splash park in the north-west corner. Public exercise equipment on the north side. Two bus routes serve this park providing access from the south and north sides."
Nice
Amazing park
beautiful and cool park
I like it most for the fields over ther
We had a wonderful time and made a new friend - the park itself.
"My kids grew up in this neighborhood and this is their favorite park. They have some renovation to the play area and soccer field, which only make it a much better place for the kids to play and enjoy themselves. In the summertime you can spend your whole day here, morning in the playground and the soccer field (remember to bring with your kids the sand toys and soccer balls),  then retreated to splash n sprinkle area where kids can cool themselves off (remember to bring the towels and water toys) and snooze off for a nap on the way home. Hooray for Loyola Park."
"Big park
Great place to walk your dog."
Great place for the kids to play soccer and to have fun in 2 parks.
Nice spot for families. Excellent soccer field for everyone!
My kids play soccer in the park that's very good nice clean park
We live across the street from it.. we got everything from soccer fields to baseball.. play ground and water games for the little ones...
Great park for children. But there aren't trees.
"Very family/ child oriented,  clean and big,  really nice"
Great pslce to do laps. Lots of bars to workout on.
Fully renovated park and astro turf soccer fields
No hand soap in the toilets that plenty of kids and family are using. Incredible.
As of June 21st play area has yet to be installed but it's shaping up. Splash pad still functional though. Very excited for them to finish... My kids are being very impatient about it.
"Love the variety of sports field here. They have fields for soccer, baseball, water park, ping pong table... A lot of green and wide open space. I love to take a walk here to take a breath."
Filthy Sprinklers.  Kids should wear some kind of sandals here and the city desperately needs to clean these.
Great place for kidsüëç
"A nice park with a kids playground and lots of other place for doing sports (baseball field, jogging, soccer). Has picknick tables and lots of trees."
Cool water park
Great park. Grew up near by. Nice to see it's still thriving.

"Interesting location, lots of attractions, bycicling access and lots of nature... into Montreal.  Great for family fun!!"
"it can be better , good potentials but they not being used , I guess I have a another meaning of a "" Park "" then what the municipality does ."
Nice and clean. Good example for the other NDG parks.
Kids play soccer here and there is always a fresh pile of dog turds waiting to be stepped on - stay classy NDG dog owners!
Football; baseball; ping pong; kids play ground; maybe even kids pool. All together amassing park to kick it in

Nice small park.
I went to this park once and it was full of weirdos.
"Mad decent parc, right by the Canal, just missing a bit more trees in certain parts that feel exposed on sunny days."
Beautiful linear parc near the canal. Camouflaged heron doing some fishing.
Sweet little spot by the canal for a picnic. There have been quite a few people here during the pandemic (to keep in mind)
Nice place to relax
Good place to sit and relax and wonder where it all went wrong
Well located park. There's a Bixi station right next to it.

Small park /  with some toys for kids. Right next to lively Mont Royal Avenue.
Watched Bohemian Rhapsody here for free.
"Cool park, has a lovely treehouse. Could be better if the tables wouldn't be vandalized with graffiti and if the treehouse would be in better shape. It also has a playground ideal for kids to play in."
Nice park with a water park.
Interesting small park with nice trees. There's alot of pigeons and squirrels.
Small yet a nice place right on Ave Mont-Royal. Great Christmas events organized for X-mas 2017
The park is so good special the scool
"Small, but with all essentials for toddlers. No water games. Water fountain. No toilets. Massive concrete table(s) for picnics on the go.

While certain parts of the parc are solely used by families with kids, other areas of this (small) parc are hosts to questionable guests."
Small but cozy...having a special side towards rue Mont Royal where you can see people and cars passing...
Just saw a show of a couple having sex in the kids playground! Quite interesting.
"Nice little park, structures for kids of various ages."
"This is nice park in the winter, but any other time of the year it is filled with people smoking, drinking, littering & generally being incredibly obnoxious."
"It's a quiet place, feel like out of the city for a moment"
Cool
"Small park, quit clean and safe."
"Great views. When I was there for the first time (early June), there were cute little baby geese which was cool."
"Beautiful park with paved walks, bike path and lookouts"
Beautiful park
"Good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in some other places.

Good quality stuff!

I would go there every time in the future.

You should look at what they offer and choose what is best for you!

Very nice place and I will go there again in the future, I like that is not far from where I live and it‚Äôs not very busy in the week-ends.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find it pleasant easy accessible and comforting."
It was wonderful.  Friendly people.

"Nice big park. Lots of shade. Nice kid games. Water splash pad is a bit small, but does the job of refreshing the kids. Will try pedal boat next time."
"I love this park and think it's amazing, the ground there is amazing and absolutely perfect for skating, biking, roller blading or just taking a walk. There is also not one but TWO fountains in the lake and a third one for kids to play, there's also a small water park area, a beautiful forest with paths a ice skating arena, multiple little huts and a gigantic playing area with toys/platforms for children of all ages. Not to forget a large hill perfect for sliding down during winder an a full sized baseball field."
Nice park to relax. Have a picnic. Smaller than I thought.  Stay away from the little forest. It loaded with poison ivy.
"A beautiful park with many features. A lake with friendly ducks in the water and out, play grounds for kids,  beautiful flowers,  amazing short trails with real look like various animals among the trees, picnic tables and other facilities..
and I haven't seen it all...."
"My go to park with my kids. Sucha nice place, very quite and so clean."
Beautiful park must visit at least once.
Beautiful park with playground for the kids and lake to feed the loons. Access to several baseball diamonds as well as a walkway for human rights. Shalom Bloom sculptures are amazing!
Amazing park ..
"Shade was finally added to the Park. The play structures are great for older kids but for the little ones I feel like they could install another ""classic"" play structure with slides and tubes. Space is certainly not an issue. Splash pad is nice but entirely shaded. Would have been great to have only the seating area shaded. The pond in the park is great when paddle boats can be used (closed for now due to covid). The park has a rink (just renovated) and 2 baseball fields but I have not used them yet to give feedback. Most importantly 5 stars for the ppl who visit the park (most at least ;))"
Everything great at park except not happy park is named PET and ball park named after Gary Carter.  Both had nothing to do with CSL and the son of PET is ruining Canada
A quiet beautiful parc.  I always love this place .

Just as it was 20yrs ago except the name used to be Centennial Park"
"Great park with lively lake inhabited by maybe geese and ducks, a nice path through nature and some art! Also has a human rights promenade!"
Small but well equipped park
"AMAZING PARK!!!!!!!! Whenever I go to this park, I can't stop smiling. It is so nice to see the ducks and Canada geese swimming around in the pond with pedal boats. There are also sprinklers and a playground in this wonderful park. There are even a whole bunch of beautiful sculptures. There is something for all ages. If you happen to be in Montr√©al, stop by at this park. You won't regret it."
Here you throw a birthday party in the park.
Sunset views ‚ù§Ô∏è

I love this place.
Little playground. Two big baseball field. üòä
Big improvements have been made to my favorite childhood park. In my opinion it ranks in the top 10 most beautiful parks in Montreal.
Very nice large park. Excellent for families. Please note that there is a sprinkler pad (bring your bathing suits or and towels) and a play area. Great for walking around the pond or for family fun.
Just peachy
It's a nice enough area here either I was visiting one of my clients who lives right next door or they could have seen at the open market where they had organic food next door to the park her fruits and vegetables and stuff. Either way it's a very nice area full of homes and families and a generally clean cut and well-kept environment throughout this area. The little park is no exceptions
The lake needs to be cleaned. Otherwise a nice place.
"Pretty good, would be better in my opinion if they had a basketball court"
"Nice park for a casual place to chill and bring the family to a afternoon out. There's a nice (crazy) playground, water games for children and sport field."

"This is a gorgeous park with numerous activities for children of all ages. The children enjoyed rope bridges, mini zip lines and other climbing cubes. All the equipment is well maintained and the park is very clean."
My daughters love this place
"I love this park! The play equipment is all new and modern - and fun! It's not sterile like so many other ""modern"" play structures are. Even I wanted to climb it!
There is also a wide variety of spaces in this park - from a sculpture garden to a roller hockey rink to paddle boating - which provide a lot of opportunity for anyone to find enjoyment in this park. C√¥te Saint-Luc has done a remarkable job with developing and maintaining this park."

Great park. Lots to do

"Since I live only two blocks away, I love that park. It's very green, and usually baseball games go on at night. Warning to all the people wanting to go there, it is closed due to renovations."
This is a great facility with top notch groundskeeping. Dugouts could use some shade though. Excellente terrains de baseball mais il y a peu d'ombre.
"A very well kept park. Different park activities for children of varying ages, as well as quieter spots for adults"
Very nice park except for very loud trains and no benches around pond.
Nice place for passing your time in family and with friends

Not the cleanest and it stinks because of the dump right next door.
Needs more fields
Nice

"beautiful, quiet park! A must visit"
"It is the place where Lina Payette-Rayes writes her romantic poems. A quiet park inspiring her to describe very emotional images in innovative poetic concepts. I hope one day, she will receive an award. She is one of the last artists/writers that can still tell stories about genuine love, hope and humanity in that cruel zombie-robots age."
A must visit on a beautiful sunny morning.
Always my favourite place to go. Its such a beautiful parc with river by its side give a feel of inner peace and serenity
"Beautiful parc. It's a shame young people gather in the table right next to the kid's playing area to smoke weed, it might be  9 meters from the actual playground (maybe it's not even 9 meters) but why there? There are lots of other benches and tables further away?
Also, there is this one trash can that hasn't been emptied for days and it ruins the whole ambiance"
Fresh Air lots of space water front best part you're in the Island of Montr√©al
Good place and Press Press AIR

"The park is a very good place to relax in. With another yard of grass to walk your dog or play sports, it is very good. It even got restaurants close to it. No problems, with water games for children. As I said, the place is good for relaxing, walking, playing and chilling."
It's cool
not Have swing
"Nice park, but lacks shaded areas to sit under. The water games there lack the same shaded spots so while your kid would play in the water you get roasted in the sun. also the single walkway that goes around the park is shared by bikers and pedestrian alike. Few days ago my toddler was almost run over by a novice lady with the bike that lost control and almost fell on my son."
"Nice park. Love that they have so much in a small space. Playground equipment is great. Small and big park. Hills to run, paths to bike, pool and splash pad!
In the winter they have good hills for sliding down and a cute Ice rink!"

Lovely quiet woodsy walking trails.  Not really a sitting around place.
"Nice park with water pad, could use a bit of cleaning but overall great place for kids"
Nice view of downtown Montreal  from parc felix

Very spacious and very nice.
Nice place but a little bit too windy...
So many littering in the park.
"I like the park, vast and not crowded, you can breath there, good water playground, which was still working in October üòÅ. I didn't enjoy the wind there, it is more windy because the park is on a slope and at some point you get cold."
I like walking in this park. Pretty quiet most of the time. I usually go after supper. Overall nice walk since the elevation helps to drown out the traffic.

One of the best Trail Parks in Montreal.
"Amazing park. You can find an amalgamation of forest, Park, hiking, big river and an awesome view of the city. If you are planning to spend your whole day together with your family, friends and kids don‚Äôt miss it. You won‚Äôt know how time flies when you get in the river view podium. Slightly blowing cool air, fantastique river views after a bit of tiredness of forest walk OMG...... amazing. I don‚Äôt have words to explain........ just can say go and get experience"
"I like this park, it has great views..‚ù§"
"Tennis courts need to be cleaned a little more often, as when we went, the ground was full of fallen leaves. Porta potties are available to the public."
Quite a nice experience playing football until someone let their dog loose and it destroyed our ball lmao
One of our kids favourite parks in NDG. Really nice neighbourhood park.

good park to walk and share with the family
Great place for an ice cream!
Cute neighborhood park.
"Ok so Montreal has a ton of parks and they're all pretty nice, BUT this park is not only gorgeous (massive fountain), but it's dab smack in one of the coolest neighborhoods in the city (St.Henri) and as such surrounded by AMAZING eateries. So you can grab something to go and do some serious chillaxin' in the park."
"Great little square, perfect for small meetings with friends. Had a nice time with people doing unofficial open mic sessions over there. Too bad there are no bathrooms close to it since the pool closed due to the pandemic."
Great place to visit in quartier St Henry. Authentic touch of  French Canadian culture. Great neighborhood and places to eat
of course I like it it's my park :)
"Very nice and clean pool! Also, nice little park for gathering with friends."
Beautiful space.
Beautiful place to be.
"A very nice little park , with a beautiful fountain, and views over old buildings , close to restaurants and ideal to bring a picknic"

"People are good about keeping their distance. The park is clean, just some spots in the grass as far as negatives go."
Beautiful park.
Peaceful yet always full of neighborhoody activity.
Amazing park. Great fountain in the middle. In the winter there is a great little rink. In the summer everyone has picnics and plays various sports. There are often events as well. The big trees give a grear majestic effect. This park makes me happy. I love seeing everyone else happy in this park.
"Great space to enjoy the outdoors in the middle of St-Henri.  Tons of great foodie spots within walking distance.  Eat great, then take a nice stroll to walk off those calories."
"I love the mist they installed, very refreshing. Only thing i hate is that the garbage cans are always full and overflowing..."
Lovely small-medium sized parc in St Henri
Nice big park... lots of shade... but a lot of garbage everywhere...
One of the most beautiful park in Montreal. Yours to discover!
Great local park to come spend a nice sunny day outside with the family and pets. Also a great spot to grab a bite to eat from many of the local restaurants and enjoy the great outdoors. Lots of benches for just sitting or some have tables to help in kinda of fun you want to have. Many pathways winding in and out of the many trees here so a great place to get in a good walk.
A lovely square. Beautiful  fountain and majestic  trees. Truly enjoyed resting there
"They have picnic tables and tons of mature trees.  There are some good places to grab food in the area (tejanos, adamos, etc...) and this is a perfect spot to eat it."
Nice gem in a nice part of the neighborhood. Perfect for picnics or just a casual relaxing sesh
Going through this park in the morning when the light is passing through the leaves... It's a blessing!
Nice little park with lots of benches and tables to sit or have a picnic.
"Nice little Park in the heart of st. Henry, beautiful fountain in the center makes for a nice place to read a book and catch some sun. Have a good night everybody don't forget to pay it forward peace"
Just visit this fountain with your lover and toss your coin and make a wish here. Then leave a comment here when your wish comes true.
"Clean space, with benches and portable washrooms... Very nice for a family gathering..."
"It's a nice little park to have a nice sit-down. Especially good if you live in that neighborhood, although I wouldn't recommend this as a visit if you're a tourist."
"Humongous, pretty, lovely, full of activities during summer. Feels safe at night, beautiful fountain in its center."
Bless. Minus the statue lol
Great place for families to picnic and nice fountain
Great park with lots of green space and a pool.  Right next to two ice cream parlors
Nice quiet place to read a book
Nice place to relax when the weather is nice in the summer by the fountain.
Nice park
"Nice park, regentrified area"
Ok
Very nice place to bring the kids and have a picnic or have festivities going on
This parc is so great with its pld trees and a nice fountain in the middle. Good for relaxing or a pic nic.
Best park in Saint-Henri. Lots of room for picnics.
My old hoods park.  Not a million things to do but a great place to bring your own bbq and have a gathering.
"Beautiful park, nice fountain, tennis courts and free outdoor swimming pool in the summer time."
Beautiful park with its fountain in the middle.
A small park with charm and a few activities like pool and tennis
Nice wooded park with a fountain and free public pool.
"Pool, tennis and bocce court... In summer this park is amazing"
Love seeing the flowers evolve on the side by the canal.
"Awesome park to relax, picnic, or take a swim."
I saw an albino squirrel. 10 points if you can find it.

"Park, tennis, swimming."
Beau parc ds st -Henri mais fontaine souvent hors fonction
"Agreablement calme avec un supcon
de personne louche!%@$@"
Small but warm park
Because of social diseasing my friends and I came here to have a picnic. There are lots of text benches as well as picnic tables so it's perfect for social distancing. There is lots of play area as well so be sure to bring your kids.
Place to relax.
Reminds me of Central Park
the kids love it
In front of the Old port of Montreal.
"If you've used the main entrance to the Berri metro station on the corner of Ste Catherine and Berri, chances are that you've walked through this square. Place Emilie-Gamelin is usually very busy during the summer. It's very popular with a large number of do-nothings, especially on a sunny day."
"It is what it is. Lots of homeless and addicts hang out here. Pre Covid there used to be shows and a food and drinks place that was pretty good, you could have a burger and coffee while watching a show. I have no idea what will happen this summer."
Could be a nice place to sit but it is the spot of all alcooholics and junkies of the area. In pandemic can be dangerous to go as they are approaching without any distance safety or masks.
Best demonstrations in town; my wife and I serve food to the homeless once in a while.
The parc is nice in general but sometime it is dirty and full of homeless
The food is excellent!! Also there's a gigantic chess board on the floor.
"Its a park where you can relax. But be advised, there are all kinds of people who go there like , drug dealers and users,  and a lot of beggars. There is nothing wrong with that, try to be generous, even if you know they will spend it on the wrong thing try not to judge or be upset when they ask. It is truly very hard to be hooked on a substance especially when these people are in constant despair...something to tink about. Not recomend to hang there at night alone."
"In the summer as Jardins Gamelin this place has a very unique vibe, a mix of students, tourists, oddballs and the more shady. There's always concerts or street artists, and a food truck (albeit expensive) is permanently parked in the summer.

There's a homeless presence and a lot junkies (who seem to be on meth), but they're generally harmless. Would't recommend coming here late at night though, unless there's a concert or something going on."
"It could be nicer for students, they're trying to help the homeless with free food and housing but it is not safe for families and babies"
Nice park with plenty of sitting space and an event ground.
"Awesome place! Specially in the summer where many activities are held. It's next to Berri UQAM station and St Catherine. We attended the Circus event there and was awesome! A lot of space, good facilities and perfect ambiance in the heart of Montreal."
Hangout for homeless folks. It‚Äôs a bit rough
"Great spot... During the summer they organize all kind of events there. They just installed some high tech bathroom next to Berri street. Good vibe, good music, good people. They also serve drink and food"
This park is pretty and there will be events sometimes. The only drawback is too many homeless people staying here.
"Beautiful park in downtown Montreal near the gay village. They have a food vendor selling meals which include vegan options and a bar that sells sangaria, mixed cocktails and local beers. The park also has  table soccer and ping pong. Various events are hosted there including live bands, DJs and trivia nights."
Neighborhood park with nightly activities (at least in the summer while I was here) and a small cafe with alcohol. Lots of great people watching and a good vibe.
"The place has some great views. Also, there is always something interesting happening at this place."
A nice place during the Montr√©al compl√®tement cirque festival. Take care with your belongings. Some homeless people are present in the area.
Was there drunk at 4 am very nice and calm
Really cool its a great location
Smells like pee and it's a really shady area.
Not my favorite spot when their is no music show or other things going on
Open place with options to showcase variety of art forms.
Park Gamelin is great because during the summer there are lots of events including karaoke and dancing nights. I wouldn't consider this spot to chill since you can encounter quite a few strange people there (but during the event nights it is very nice and lively). It is located right next to Berri UQAM metro station.
Always a fun place when they have music/festivals on.
Free outdoor entertainment in the summer and a nice place to sit and chill during the Fall.
Great place to have a drink and listen to music in summer. I went in August 2018 and we had lunch and a beer in the sunshine
"It's a beautiful park with live music, benches, games, and truly romantic atmosphere. However it turns into a drug park after dark wich is a bit of a downside."
"Very cool area of town to check out, very vibrant, fun, and cool shops. The community garden is lovely, and a nice addition to the area. Local vibe!"
Not clean enough . Garbage everywhere
Populated at night by the homeless. However a nice park
"Very nice place to hang out or meet people. Diverse music, casse croute, cute terrace, ping pong tables and a bit further long chairs beside a water fountain. My favorite place to chill that is free in MTL"
"I absolutely love all the events Place √âmilie-Gamelin organizes each year to showcase all the talents that Montreal has to offer. Wish you guys the best of luck for the future. It‚Äôs remarkable how you execute each time with such eye catching events.

With kind regards,
-ArtIsMyAbsolute"
Nice park. Just a few homeless around
"Hermoso but at nigth ,rat take the place to be."
A very busy place
A perfect destination to watch shows during Festival de Montr√©al compl√®tement un cirque.. Or even to watch a soccer game.
"Lots of great vibes. People enjoying their company and the environment. While I was there, they had karaoke which was a blast. They were also setting up for a jazz festival."
Nice downtown park
The city has tried and for the most part succeeded in making this part of the city beautiful... However old habits die hard and some drug trading and taking can be expected to be seen here. Heavy police presence makes it safe to visit for sure..buti wouldn't bring small children around here.
We were there to see this dance performance in August 8th. It was great. The park itself is good too. Lots of urban-street-outdoor events take place there.
"Awesome public space very well arranged and dedicated to performing arts, street food and urban agriculture during the summer"
Nice garden place with several exotic plants and a lot of scheduled activities and art spectacles.  It also has a high-tech fully auto-cleaning smart  restroom.
I went to this park to enjoy a huge circus act with family and it was AMAZING! It was so amazing that im surprised that it was free. This was our third year going and we WILL ....be going again next year!
"As the venue for the grande spectacle du festival compl√®tement cirque, this outdoor park/caf√©/beer garden is one of my favourite places to go on summer evenings. Very close to the vibrant Gay Village, rue St Denis, and the Berri-UQAM subway stop."
Very nice place during the day and the beginning of evening. Very sketchy at night. They have have outdoor music and it is generally a nice place to sit and chill with friends
The employees in that place are very kind especially the ladies
A small park in the village that now has an outdoor cafe (Jardins Gamelin) during the summer.
"It is a good place with some streets lighted, but no more. It was in construction when I went so I didn't enjoy the park so well."
Kind of dangerous and dirty. Many hommless
"Really fun area to discover right in the middle of the city. We stumbled upon a pub quiz, which was a lot of fun! Only downside is that it was a bit dirty. The tables and chairs could've done with a wipe down!"
The Place to be all Summer and they sell stuff. Buy it to help out. Great place to chill
Great during summer months when St Catherine is closed ...the rest of the year is a meeting spot homeless and some drug activists
Stop. No. Don't.
"Superb park offering tons of activity here and there throughout the year, it is clean and lively as there's a bar and restaurant in there. During the summer, there's free yoga session every Wednesday morning and free board games once in a while animated by the staff from Randolph."
"It's a beautiful park that offers great seating, a place to eat or drink, and often something fun to participate in, or just watch. The music playing is always great to listen to, and even though you are in a public park with people all around, the placement of the seats offers you an illusion of privacy."
Super cool outdoor park with music and dancing and beer on tap. Great for a chill night out.
"It is. A cool chill place in the summer. No fees. They do events, plays, this year they did a free circus"
"Here you can see different shows summertime. There's music, food, activities and more. It is near Montreal downtown and you can use the metro to get there. You can find lots of different stores, restaurants, bars etc. It is next to the St. Denis street where you can see shows and stars."
Very nice park Plenty of restaurants nearby and also the metro station Berri UQAM Is right there
"Nice place surrounded with coffee and restaurants, and there are chairs in the park just set and enjoy the events and the music at night time especially in the summer"
Cozy place to watch shows and just hang out and snack wirh friends on a sunny summer day
"Nice park with events practically every night, with it's own bars and realtors near by. Next to Metro Berri UQAM a nice place to pass the night."
"Nice little green area in the middle of the city, close enough to UQAM to use thier WIFI.
Various events take place throughout the year and are sure to suit many tastes !"
Nice picnic tables. There's beer and food vendors too. Nice light visual at night. However there are many bums during the day.
Kinda getto looking but good for a midday nap. Sometimes has EXCELENT shows like the one I caught. So cool!
Great atmosphere. The food at the cafe is original and tasty. I had the poke bowl. Prices are fair. While we were there they had a live acrobat show and great accompanying music
One of the great places for summer events in Montreal! Dancing evenings with free begginer classes almost every day of the week. Super cute drink and food court available - also restrooms. Different music rhythm each day in a very friendly and diverse ambiance.
"Mixed feelings - nice garden, edibles BUT at night the locals can be a bit loud"
"We visited twice over the canada day weekend. The park was alive and had entertaining events going on (even though one was a rehersal). The park was a little dirty, we did notice a city worker cleaning up though"
"This park, just east of Berri-UQAM station and south of the Grande Biblioth√®que, is a friendly and invting green space guarding the western end of the Gay Village. There are always plenty of activities staged here."
"There are drunks everywhere and homeless people on the ground and the kids are afraid to play in the park but there are restaurants and tables to eat and a scene to see shows. Also, there is plenty of vegetation and a garden that you can visit. There is also a structure with flowing water that you can admire."
best place to chill. I'd like to stay there for hours.
"I always had fun at this park. They do a variety or activities throughout the summer. Kareoke, music, dance, shows, and performance. And there is a bar. Lovely clean and lively. One of my favorites in Montreal"
"Music they play is great, people are so friendly.. feel very safe.."
"Really nice place to sit back, grab a sandwich, enjoy the fresh air and listen to the squabble of montrealers all around."
"Lots of things too do,friendly people everywhere"
A very nice place to make friends and  share aspects of your culture
"Nice park with lots of activities all year-round, but way too many drug dealers, homeless people and trash all over"
Great park in the summer with lots of events. A new feature is there is a outdoor paid washroom.
"Nice little park downtown.  People were friendly enough, but area seems to cater to the younger crowd."
Nice outdoor casse-croute. People watching. Sometimes strange people watching.
"Well set up again this year. Lots of seating, and the snack bar is excellent."
Absolutely beautiful
They always close for some remodeling
Always like this park
"Very nice atmosphere where you meet people, dance and interact with them."
Nice place to chill with friends and have a good time. Drinks a bit pricey though ü§î
Good but lots of work as to be done
Love the water falls and they always have music playing and sometimes live events.
Is amazing place/ Simon PASCAL artist üëèüíØ
"Place √âmilie-Gamelin is very lively, well located and easily accessible because of the proximity of the metro Berri-UQAM."
Good place with lot of efforts from the government to mask the impression ofdrug addict's zone. It certainly feels different now.
"This place has changed a lot in the last couple of years. Now there is a terrasse to enjoy the spot in summer. Very often there are cultural activities going on. Most of the time, they have a photography installation and during the Cirque festival there is a local show that goes I think twice a day. Hope the city keeps changing it and making it better."
"Nice outdoor place, events, restaurant and pub ... Really nice to visit in summer it's must go in summer :)"
What a great night out in the park a place to enjoy a drink and meet new people.
Worth the detour during summer time if you are visiting.
cool place summer and winter events e ery season
This space has evolved over the past years. I really like what it has become. Joyful. Open to all. Even agriculture as its place there. And it is now the center stage for many events in Montreal.
Relaxing park with outdoor entertainement summer festivals ( free)
Amazing summer place to get some fresh air and enjoy the activities
we love it here during circus season in July!
"Excellent space where everyone in the family can experience a lovely weekend afternoon.
Yesterday (Saturday) there was Salsa playing and people dancing all over the place!"
Nice little park. Just sad that its all trashy. Some events and mobile food thingies are often there.
"The suspended web is very cool. But other than that and the occasional show during festivals, I wouldn't hang out there."
"The event was fun, but I don't like crack smoke."
Beautiful place in Montreal
"Their summer event schedule is off the hook! They also have a schedule during the winter! great shows and events!
Ps: Just note that the parc is also where homeless people hang out. Metro Station Berri-Uqam"
"Free WiFi, free events. It's clean and family friendly"
Very pleasant park in the summer. Right down town. Beside metro Berri-UQAM.
"Every Wednesday ""A heart for others"" provides a lunch for needy persons and homeless"
"Clean, crowd well behaved, security is evident and we'll done"
We smoked weed at this place and the little river is amazing
"Great place for family. There is a fountain on the hill, music, restaurants, lots of places to sit. There is a kids area in the park with toys and activities called la maison jaune.

We loved it here except the constant flow of people who kept sitting by the kids area to smoke. There were plenty of other spots but they just kept choosing to sit by the kids area and smoke and they weren't parents."
"Nice place, is free and you can enjoy different shows."
Convenient park near restaurants used for music and entertainment.
It is a beautiful place to hang out in the summer!

From what I can remember it was a wonderful place!
"Nice gathering place, very liked by local residents."
Great atmosphere in the evening when the salsa dancing was happening.
Nice place with good food and nice public show
Went for an nice walk to just chill.
"Really like what they did two years ago. They turned the place into a big lively space with music, food and drinks. It used to be really sketchy. It still can be at around 4AM ; it's Montreal."
Top with the artificiel water falls and good music
"City needs to do more
The one star is just for effert"
"Used to be a pretty trash spot, but the city invest a lot to make this place beautiful. Live music/ sports on TV/ huge chess games / a restaurant and a bar / gardens and artistic decorations are all things you can find there during the summer"
"A pretty relaxed environment, with a variety of events happening year long."
It is the place to be for free dancing classes and practice nights. Different themes and teachers. Dsy or night this park is well managed with places to sit and relax
"This square has a lot of history: popular congregation spot for protests, homeless people, drug dealers and summer festivals. The city continues to revitalize the place with some success. The square now hosts plenty of free shows, art installations and a beer garden during summer. Grab a drink at the beer garden in late afternoon/early night on Thursday or Friday."
"Has improved a lot in the past years, not as sketchy anymore. Pretty nice when the water is flowing in the artistic installation. Lots of events during the summer."
Very good.
"Don‚Äôt know what this area is like during the day, but we nicknamed this place ‚Äúneedle park‚Äù after a very bad encounter with some dirt merchants late one night, on our way back from a show at the Olympia.  Please be extra cautious in this area at night, stay aware of your surroundings and travel with groups of people."
Always a great place to go. üòÑ
Great outdoor shows. Cool bar and nice staff. Like the fact that they have a community garden.
Wonderful place to grab a drink and relax. They have DJs at night and other activities. Check out the schedule on the website.
"Cleans up pretty good! The gardens are beautiful, and the explanation panels are a great idea."
They always have cool things going on
Beautiful ambiance and experience in summer.
Just passing thru... seemed lovely
It's awesome place just to hangout.. great vibe... can meet a lot of crowd... also it's a beautiful spot in middle of downtown...
Public dancing when I went. So cool!
Nice park to spend spare time.
"There's normally some good event going on here.
And the location couldn't be better. Easily accessible from all 3 Metro lines."
Very interesting public space in downtown
Good place to dance latin music during the summer
This place is so much better than it used to be
Lots of event to make this place nicer than it used to be. That's a real positive urban policy initiative that should be followed
"Best place for fun at summer, chilling vibe"
"Can you tell me a better Park ??
I think Not"
During the summer always nice activities to do
I wen there during the annual Pride Parade. There are so many people gathered there on that day with all kinds of rainbow elements. Great spot to enjoy yourself.
Good spot to rest your while away. There are adirondack chairs where you could snuggle up while you read a book or just take a snooze after walking around Gay Village.
Fun festival to be at with friends and loved ones
"The gentrification has really cleaned the place up. But I would still be wary.
Shout out to the Nantha's Kitchen pop up and his amazing Malaysian spicy food!"
"Each event here is wonderful and fun, specially Montreal compl√®tement cirque"
"parks full of crackheads and heroin junkies, but its not bad when patrolled. live music/ dj stand and small cafe in the summer is awesome."
Great for the centre of town and helpful for breaks and lots of pin in tables in shades for centre town workers in break. And very handy places in Montreal near the bus gare of Montreal.

Great place to have a drink and listen to music in summer.

The music is a bit loud sometimes but the shows and events are great!
"Great spot, especially in the summer months with numerous festivals, installations and such. Barrie UQAM metro on site; easily accessible."
Because of the good food
"Lovely meeting spot in the heart of Centre Ville. This park is all inclusive and has a host of programs, (city run) throughout the year."
It is adorable
a great place to almost nap in the sun
It's a good area to enjoy the various events that happen here but I personally never feel safe (especially with my family) since there are so many junkies & homeless people roaming around here all day long.
The park is very beautiful and I also saw a lot of bars nearby so if you feel like hanging around this is the place.
It is being set up totally fenced off. I don't understand the necessity of totally cuting off access to the park.
"Best place to hang out with your loved ones, especially kids."
"Love this park, so much diverse history"
There's always great events!
"Since 2015 the beer garden organised in the park plus the acrobatics performances, dancing and many other cultural activity the place was rescued and re given to the citizens."
Nice place to hang out in the afternoon. You can just sit on the grass. There is food and drink too.
The remodeling is really nice.
"It's a very ""popular""... A must"
Cool place
Nice Park with many activities during the summer and some during winter. It has been renovated and since a lot less homeless ppl around.
Too many homeless.
After some renovation the park has become more family friendly with many activities happening in summer and few in Winter
Went to see a music and live are event. It was very enjoyable and I really appreciated all the edible landscaping!
Great place to sit and relax with a couple of friends. The people watching is top notch.
Cool spot. Always something going on here. Relaly like it
"Used to live in the area in the past. The place used to be horrible and i appreciate them cleaning it up for the festivals and stuff. However there are still too many hobos around, care for needles."
"Nice place to relax with Jardin Gamelin, music, food and drinks. It's like a park-bar"
"The atmosphere of this ""park"" is a mix of garbage dump, prison excercize yard and refugee camp. Very irresponsible to be sending clueless foriegn tourists here as if it was Mount Royal."
Love the water there and chairs for people to use everyone is pretty chill a few shady characters up top but a decent police pr√©sence so you are pretty safe.
Great place to dance in the summer with the salsa events
Family friendly
"Eat drink enjoy music  you can add salad from the garden he for me it""s the best"
"Nice park, but not always clean. It's a popular spot for homeless people and unfortunately, it smells quite a lot..."
"Park with a bistro-bar in it, lots of public art, pretty water features, a children's reading corner and a vegetable patch."
"The night show Rouge was great, and the atmosph√®re was pleasant. Take your own seat or smth to put on the grass."
It's really a Nice place to visit quiet and cool during jazz festival
"Seasonal entertaining free events regularly going on all along the year in a friendly and captivating environment, making this one of the most alive center in Montreal!!"
"Great place to visit. Nice views, clean air and daily free fun events in summer."
Crack central but not too dangerous...
"In summer, fantastic atmosphere with lots of people dancing to oldies. However, that was a Wednesday evening, and on Thursday it was a bit dead (perhaps people go elsewhere)."
I recommend it. It's amazing.
Beautiful place ‚ù§Ô∏è
They now have an open air Caf√© /resto. Last Wednesday evening they had a DJ with people dancing.

Great spot in a troubled neighborhood.
Lovely place during the samer specially during the festival season when there is always something happening.
"Beautiful park with art, music, dancing  and vendors."
Not sure what to do of your friday evening? There will definitely be dancing going on here.
Too many bums.
"""Les Jardins Gamelin"" 5/5 star - but only when there are events and it's crowded.  Otherwise the area can be pretty saturated with drug addicts - which is cool - just not the coolest spot to hang out."
Twice I sit down here twice I was offered to buy ilegal drugs
A huge park near berri DE montigny metro. Pleasant when sunny outside. eventful when local artists show up!

"Great meeting spot! And usually filled with local art , music, and events :D"
"Beautiful at night, good places to sit, live music at the restaurant near by to listen to"
Gentrification efforts at √âmilie-Gamelin are going well. It's become a popular spot for hanging out on summer evening. Unfortunately that meant actively driving the homeless out despite the place's history as an unofficial camping spot as well as Sister √âmilie Gamelin's lifelong work in helping those in need.
"Very good place it's the hart of downtown ,lovly people,good place to meat new people."
"Questionnable place to hang out. I wouldn't bring kids and friends here, criminals lurking all around the place, especially at night."
Such a nice atmosphere for an event
In the heart of Montreal. Just sitdown there and enjoy.
Lively place with plenty of good food and drink.
Dance training and party is a real pleasure there!
Nice place during festivals or to chill. There's a lot of homeless people and junkies tho
Nose place to relax
Loads of action and energy in this square
Charming area great for a stroll
Cool square . Very lively in summer with ongoing events.

Great free shows for the public and a good cafe on site.
Absolutely wonderful during the summer
"events all around the SUMMER! You can also get some drinks at the local shop, but make sure to carry cash"
Nice place

A basic downtown cement park. Watch for the fascists who like to gather there.
Nice place.

The free circus shows during summer are the best.
Yeah
"The place is cool. However, some people (especially those who spend their lives there) are really annoying which is sad."
"circus was ok, but its not a family friendly place"
Great when there's a show
Love what they've done to the park.
Nice place but the many homeless people asking for money and drug dealers and users makes it a little less so.

Some nice large trees, and the homes surrounding are large and somehow inviting. They say to me, don‚Äôt you wanna live here? I never see anyone enter or exit them. Nice in the sun or after dark here."

This is a very pleasant little park surrounded by some of the nicest houses in Outremont. The park is on a gentle slope. Lots of trees provide plenty of shade and protection from the sun (well appreciated in summer). There are tennis courts and a small park for children. A destination for family picnics or children birthday parties. There could be a few more benches for sitting.

Beautiful park :)

Nice little park for hanging around in summer for locals.
"beautiful, quiet, beautiful fountains and little areas for picnics and such"
Kind of bland.Boring place. Looks ok but coyld use some paint and trim. Maybe a few more trees. Benches are all in the blazing sun. No shades sitting areas with benches. (You can sit on the ground under a tree but in same parks they have benches in the shade.)
"If you play PoGo, this is one of the best places to go to get an ex-raid pass!"
Fountain is a good place to read but it's not always on.  The path are starting to be replaced by grass...
Nice park but could use a little upkeep on the benches
Cute little park

"Nice, clean and good views of the canal."

Such a great place.
"Short rive shoreline to take a walk or have a rest. The river at this point is pretty narrow, and you can see the housea across the river very clearly. Water is not that clear, and since the river bank on the other side is filled with houses, there is not much nature view. It is a quiet place in a neighborhood though."
Pleasant park. Could use some tlc though.
"Wild woods by a river bank, under protection environmental diverse area.
It is a habitat for rabbit, squirrel, snake , duck, goose and even herons. Visitor to the area should be accompanied by adults. The place has its name because of the rapids. Depending on condition, the area could be flooded or this time I can even walk on the river bed.
Looking north is Saint Dorothee , west is Ile Bizards.
Underneath the rapid is a geographical fault line."
"A pleasant walk although not much to see other than the highlights of seeing attractive graffiti art under a bridge and the waterflow control dikes.
Perhaps there are other hiking routes that I have yet to discover. Great for a Sunday stroll."
"Beautiful river front site to hear the rapides and enjoy the motor boats going up the designated marked water right of way up and down the back river. Have no idea where to park, but believe the only parking is on the street. Bring a lunch and drink to enjoy. Place Riviera is the development at end of chemin des sources, and down towards the water."
"Beautiful nature parc with an incredible view. It has lots of grass to play all kinds of sports like frisbee, football, soccer, volleyball. There's some trails you can enter on either side to walk through the woods. And depending on the water level, you can go right next to the water. Highly recommend to get out and explore!"
Quiet place without many people.
Incredible little green spot that transporta you to the Bridge of Therabithia
Very open and near to river .. good to enjoy natural beauty
"I love the environment, the place was very clean things inside was orderly placed teachers there were very friendly and respectful.

Place tranquille en famille c'est parfait
"This is very chill. Only 3 picnic tables but can easily accommodate you and a few friends.

It easily gives off a feeling of nostalgia because kids play in this park like it was the 90's.

People bring their instruments to play in the park and some people have their radio blasting 90's punk music while other people practice on their skate boards.

As older person... this oddly felt comforting. It's a really nice park."
Nice and quiet parc. I enjoyed a lot my first visit.
It's a small but nice park
"Very cool for kids, water games and playground!"
good for kids but should be renovated soon

Area around youngest play area is always wet on the cement apron. The drains which have filled with sand needs to be cleaned. Always puddles days after rain.
"I really like this park. It is very nice and there are many things to do. You can play baseball and tennis. Too many insects though. Overall, I think you should visit it."

"Best park in st laurent!! I spent many summers there in the 1970's. The whale used to be a kiddy pool and water used to come out of his spout as well. Gone are the steel rocket at the corner of tasse and obrien, the swings and the dangerous slide.
It has changed much over the years but provides lots of enjoyment for all generations. Relax and enjoy it!"
First time there and it was a very nice experience will go back when the weather gets warmer.
Very fun park to take kids in the summer

"This park was fully renovated in 2020 and is great for little kids.

The playground equipment is new, fenced in and placed on soft flooring materials that cushion falls. There are even water jets to play in.

You just have to watch out for speeding cars and trucks on Dupuis. (The upside is that kids who love trucks will be very happy.)"

One can enjoy both a calm and quite place as well as a lit barbecue with the friends."
Great place to spend a sunny day.  Family oriented and very clean.  A lot of shaded areas.  Recommend it to everyone!üíõ
"The nice things about this park is the varying outdoor areas that are useful like an off-leash dog enclosure, a large scattering of picnic tables, a playground for kids and views of a waterway. There are also wooded trails for walking however I did find it extremely buggy since there is several water sources around and perfect breeding grounds for these hungry little pests."
Beautiful place for family's to enjoy a little bit of nature in the city. Enjoy a hike through  the trails or bring the kids to one of the two  jungle gym parks. Feed the ducks in the pond or have a picnic BBQ on one of the many benches. Free parking. Open for bikes.
"Go to for regular walks. No matter how many routes taken, still charmed by this park's greenery, and it's natural transition in the fall and winter days. My little oasis in the middle of the city."
"Very good park for Adults and Kid . We can do loads of activities here. I like to do trail walk, cycling and sky here. This is a good place for get together with friends and family. Ofcourse we can enjoy the BBQ and Picnic as well ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"We really liked it. Kids loved the big and large space. They kept running and playing in the playground.
Slides are few but kids can play other games on the grass.
Weather also helped a lot in enjoying the day.
If you are looking for a nice park to spend the day (or even barbecue) then this is one of the best parks to visit."
"Beautiful park, well maintained.

Lots of cool little spots many do not get to see. Hint, follow some of the dirt trails and explore ;)"
Agrignon Park is a very beautiful and large natural park where you can spend a very relaxing and peaceful quality time
This is a great park for a nice walk during yesterday's great weather (nature in the city). I imagine it must be even nicer in the summer.
"Beautiful park.
If you have toddlers be careful water is deep here. Not much exciting for kids. They have small play area no water splash pad."
"Excellent park

ACCESS: Great for getting to by car, bus or metro, bike or walking. Angrignon Metro Station adjacent as well as bus routes. There are two parking lots. The south one accessible from La Verandrye is less busy and free.

SIZE: Big for a city park. Plenty of walkways & trails, big space so you don't feel everyone is ever bunched together.

NATURE: Lots of trees and a lake. You can find squirrels, many types of birds and if you're lucky a few other animals as well. Seasonal native flowers, plenty of shade.

SERVICES: Public bathrooms, benches (although many are out in the sun) , a dog park for dogs to play & run around in and there used to be a snack bar in the main building which decades ago was a small zoo (there was even an elephant in the 1980s!)

WHEN TO GO: Year-round. In winter it's a good nature walk, skating on the lake and beats being indoors. In spring lots of new buds & flowers, you see a lot of photographers taking pictures. Summer people sunbathe, walk around, bikeride, enjoy the sights near the lake. Fall is great for foliage, trees change colours.

RAINY DAYS: If you ever take a walk in a rainy day you will see a lot of animals because they are less bothered by people.

All in all a great place to enjoy nature in the city as this is one of Montreal's largest green spaces and easily accessible in any way."
"Very nice park with a mixture of tranquil water, picnic areas, remote areas and a peaceful and quiet wooded area. Enjoyed my walk!"
"Didn't see much of it. The park seems pretty huge.

They have port-o-pottys set up in different location for your convenience.

Unfortunately the garbages and recycling were packed full. I can understand that it was a busy, beautiful day. The rest of the park seemed pretty clean.

Lots of mature trees to provide shade and a spot to set up a picnic."
"Absolutely beautiful. The grounds were well maintained, and many picnic tables spread out so it never felt too packed. Can't wait to go back when the trees are in full bloom!"
Very beautiful place. If you love nature and calmness come here. Can also have BBQ with friends. Picnic and yoga sessions. Stunningly breath taking especially in the spring or late summer
Great size for a park. Ideal for your daily jogs and weekend family picnics! Clean and easily accessible from the city subway!
"A nice large park, that is easily accessible by metro (station angrignon) and large enough to not hear many cars and other city sounds. A path surrounds a very pretty lake with lounge chairs scattered about. Be on the lookout for otters, fish, turtles, and herons! There are also picnic benches available scattered throughout."
Clean and fresh n good smelling toilets. Completely free! Parking n everything free!
"We are very lucky to have many beautiful parks, such as Angrignon Park. We need to do our part to keep those parks the way they are."
One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal.
"Beautiful scenery easily accessible by car or public transport. Kilometers of path, benches and picnic tables by the water. Great place to feel in nature without leaving the city."
A beautiful park to have a fun evening or afternoon with friends/family and just barbecue or hang out in nature!
"First time seeing turtels there, not 1 but 2!
Enjoy but these days it's too crowded for my liking"
Today went for a 2 hour walk with my dog under a beautiful sunny day. Trails are still easy for walking as the snow has not quite melted yet. It feels like you're in the country.
Ideal place to have a walk after dinner or to see autumn leaves. Certainly a best venue for picnics and bar-B-Q's.
"It's a nice escape from the city , has picnic tables playground  lake where you can see geese , ducks , pathways , parking lot and easy accessible by metro , buses  enjoy walking their"
"Really nice place, quite small but a nice break from the downtown area if coming from the metro"
It's a very quiet park with a lake and plenty of picnic tables and walking or running trails.
Big park where you can evade from city. Feels like your far away in a big forest right in the city. Peaceful and not to crounded (except on weekends)  nice bike path and many walking paths on concrete or trails in the forest.
Wonderful spot to commune with nature. A peaceful refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city.
"Good for BBQ, but don't forget to take bug spray with you."
Beautiful place in the summer to come to for a picnic by the water or to look at the stars. It has a jogging/bike path as well
"Calm and quiet during the week, full of families during weekends, perfect park for a little picnic üß∫ or a short run around the lake"
Amazing sprawling park!! Great for family gathering ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Angrinon is  a great place to wander. Lots of trees, paths, streams and wildlife.  Most people respect it but there are always the 10% who litter,  don't poop and scoop, etc.   Easy access too, from the metro..."
Please if u need a place to enjoy and chill it‚Äôs here and everyone is welcome to this place
"Wonderful park in town with many possibilities to walk, make a sport or picnic!"
A large park outside of the city. It is nice to walk around the water.
"Dosen't matter the month, you could do a nice walk always,  alone or with family Angrignon Parc is the perfect place in the city to get away from the city."
Very beautiful parc with amazing lakes and prepared bbq satff
Big beautiful has wild life. Recently renovated. And has Angrignion metro station right there.
"Beautiful, quiet, bike trails, lots to see and do, BBQs allowed etc. Worth the visit."
"It was a perfect fall day and not crazy busy like in the summertime. Nice park. It's well kept and clean. There is a nice forest, but also has open spaces as well. There is also a decent size pond/lake with a path all the way around. Part of the path was made a path while some are unofficial paths. If you have children with you, you will probably want to stay on the official paths, because some of the paths near the lake are narrow and a child could easily fall into the water. The gardeners who work here are hard working and do a very good job maintaining this place. It's a nice break from the city, while being close by. Angrignon Metro Station is on the edge of the park, so it's easy to get to if you don't have a car. It has a parking lot and also street parking nearby. It's always enjoyable walking here. You are allowed to bring dogs to this park as long as they are on a leash and they are picked up after."
"An oasis of nature in the middle of a bustling metropolis. Highly inspirational, Paris and London got nothing on us."
"Great, big park with paved paths, a big dog park and cross country ski trails in the winter"
Love it  It's beautifull and nice place to relax and see the birds in the water
Great parc for a picnic with friends without having to go very far. They have parking and many picnic tables.
"The park is really large. You can enjoy fresh air blowing your distress. Birds, Gooses, and Durks are playing around and can confidently contact with people. Trees and flowers are beautifull. One minor point is the mudding roads in some places, but in general, you will be satisfied when visiting there."
"Nice park for a stroll, even when raining. There‚Äôs a lot of benches and picnic tables."
"Nice, not that criwded definately less police presence than in downtown parcs, super nice to get there biking, definately recomemd"
"This is a forest-style park with a nice architecture within the city of Montreal at the west end of green line of the metro, and terminal of many bus lines. It‚Äôs a cool place for having a weekend picnic by metro/public transit! It has an artificial lake (with fish, ducks, etc.) and some sport fields, including a dog park! Some are not accessible!"
"Beautiful green space , lovely family outing spot ."
"Paths for all seasons/many sports, Ponds for R/C boats, Close to Metro, Easy access from South shore, BBQ installations, Dog Park and More!"

Beautiful nature and nice hiking park
Great park to visit for a nice calming walk plus lots of nice place to sit and enjoy the view
"Clean, beautiful, great place for bbq with family and friends"
Full of green. You are in deep nature.
It is kinda far from where I live but I should say it definitely worth it to put mileage on my car to go there at least one time per month! Thanks to gouvernement du Qu√©bec!
Amazing place to spend time with your loves and family
A large and fairly attractive city park with good walking and cross country skiing trails.
"A real gem in Montreal.

Great for a walk, bike, picnic, playground trip."
"Wonderful to reconnect to nature any time of year.vast, wonderful paths, porto pottys for necessary emergencies. Beautiful nature to nurture our inner being and colors are magnificent."
A must go place if you're in montreal!!
"This is my favorite park in Montreal. Way better than confederation park, which if you've seen any of my previous reviews, you will know I truly hate that park. But this park is way better. I came here once for a picnic with my lovely girlfriend; we sat at a bench and watched the ducks frolic in the ocean. I saw a child chase one and fall into the water. That is the reason for my 5 star review. I came here another time and drank 11 beers in the woods while I got bitten by mosquitos. I can't help but think those mosquitos got a little bit hammered that day."
"Awesome beautiful park. Great walking trails.
Very peaceful and relaxing place"
Nice park in the city of Montreal. Large area. Near the river
Lovely trilliums and trout Lilly at this extensive greenspace
Wonderful park but they have to enlarge the parking lot.  Not enough space for cars on weekends!!
Nice place but need to clean the water.
Very good place to unwind ! Very tranquil and peaceful
Great place to do many things
"This park is a wonderful destination. Whether it be to take some quiet time by the water, a nice walk along the main trail or all throughout smaller peaceful paths. There's a significantly sized grased area and great trees with picnic tables and a great kids jungle gym - close enough to the water but far enough that it doesn't interfere with watching the decently wide variety of wildlife. Cranes, ducks, geese - all sorts of bird types - turtles, catfish :) Curious squirrels of course."
"Great place for a nice walk with a foresty view, sketchy in the evening however"
Great outdoor spaces. Good grills to bbq.
Such a cute park with a nice vibe of families
"Nice park, easily reachable from the Angrignon metro station.
There`s a lot of barbecues area ready to be used."
Very organized park in comparison to the other parks.
Magnificient place to go for a walk...lake are splendid.. excellent for wedding photography or simply watch nature. You have picnic tables as well in there ( it is very big area so be careful not to get lost in the park! ) and you can BBQ as well. Watch for mosquitos though.
"Would give a solid 5 if there weren't so MUCH trash everywhere, I get it it's spring but uhh, it's discusting"
"Beautiful place especially in fall season the colors are amazing for photo shoot if you love fall, I mean who doesn't ü§∑üèæüòÉ"
WOW! living in NDG 20 yrs never knew this was there beautiful park
One of Montreal most beautiful parc.
Lovely place to have a picnic in the summer and watch some animals.
"a beautiful park, easily accessible from the metro and several buses, with several ponds and waterfowl. there are lots of walking paths, although be prepared for some wet or muddy areas if it has been rainy. there are lots of people that use the park, but it never really feels crowded. there are places where you can have a barbecue and you will also often find people practicing Qigong and other kinds of dance at various points in the park."
Is a beautiful placeWalking through that park is wonderful in the summer a lot of vegetation
"Nice big park, love nature...."
The scenery is so beautiful right now with the fall leaves.

It's wide and fun.
"Good place for walking, jogging and riding a bicycle! And there is also a playground for kids!"
Spacious wood-like park with little activities apart of greenery.

"A nice park with man walking trails. Great way to get out of the city, and be right next to a metro!"
It's a great place.
"walking and chatting alongside the lake is the best thing to do! When the weather is warmer, I  believe running here will be lovely as well! The park is pretty big with all the trees and lakes, also many duckkkkkkks and animals :)

There are benches everywhere some even with table! Will for sure come back with some food and drinks, surely few hours will pass without even me realising!"
Nice place  to  walk through can't wait till summer
"I love this park, it's kept its natural style and it's super big with a beautiful lake river.. if only the dog owners keep the dogs in the permitted distance which is maximum 2 meters, how can we report them by the way?!"
No hills! Nice for a stroll at any time of year.
"Super pretty, trails to walk. Not always the cleanest but still nice, love the little lake as wellb"
Great and lovely park near a metro. Walk and enjoy. :)
Great winter walk with family..it was sunny just a beautiful day
Lots of people so sometimes feels too crowded for Covid Era
It is a really good place for family to spend time.

I love Montreal because you can find a beautiful oasis like this next to a metro station. My favourite is the grey heron that lives there.
Great big open park with lots of trees and picnic tables lots of open space for kids to run and play most importantly it was very clean.
Good park for running! Really beautiful in autumn üçÇ
Beautiful park
"Huge and peaceful park in Angrignon area. Two stars removed due to lack of maintenance, mosquito and goose control.... It's a dog friendly park, so you can have great time. Free and paid parking available."
"Very nice park with walking , jogging trail. Lots of trees, lake, benches, places for bbq or day picnic. This place doesnt have a structural maintained rest room service rather it has portable restrooms in different corners. It is accessible from metro and big parking lot. A place for nature lovers..."
Great place to escape pandemic and experience outdoor activities!
"Beautiful & large park! Great for walks, dogs, children, mild hiking/trekking through forest paths.
Just wish the people that throw parties and picnics would stop leaving their trash behind EVERY. SINGLE. WEEKEND! The should hire park rangers to patrol and fine these people. The amount of garbage, balloons, table cloths, plates, cups, food leftovers, beer bottles, cigarette butts, soda cans etc, is abhorrent."
Looks beautifull and cozy.
"All the parking lots were full but luckily we found one of the last spots.  Loads of families walking, bike riding, BBQ'ing lunches. Gorgeous day to be outdoors in the park."
Good facilities inside the park and nice nature. You can find a lot of squirrels in the trees. It was not as crowded as I thought it would be.
"Huge and beautiful, you can observe many types of birds and animals. Some free parking around if you go early"
Well care .... Nice place
Very nice park. Dog friendly.
"Nice park in the city. Because it's so close to the metro, it's packed in the summer with people doing BBQs and parties so not very pleasant if you want to just take a walk."
"This park has tons of hidden trails through the woods, perfect for escaping the weekend crowds. It's rare to find such solitude in the city."
the park near the metro and aslo has kids playground
"Very big park. Very spacious.
Multiple Bar b q station and picnic tables.
Might get very busy on a hot and nice weekend. So you might have to arrive early to secure a good spot.

Bathroom access is very limited not to say non existing."
This is one of the best park in Montr√©al.üíû
I like the place..i gave it a 4 because of the bugs ü§£ü§£ü§£

"Too many people on weekends, no one seems to care about physically distancing or wearing masks."
"We love it here. Such a gem in the city! They have many, many, many walking trails through the park. We especially like BBQing near the lake, which is super close to the parking lot. To note: parking lot has the typical city prices, so be prepared and pay for parking!"
"Park is a üíé on the island of Montreal
There‚Äôs  a lake inside the park and the park itself is huge with paid parking or free options on surrounding streets.
If you‚Äôre a picture or photograph  üì∑ lover you‚Äôll be more than satisfied."
Perfect place for a stroll and a picnic
"Large bautiful outdoor area, huge park with enough room for social distancing while either taking a walk, having a picknick, enjoying the scenery or having a barbecue. They do have barbecues on sight but you can also bring your own if you're worried about sanitation. Multiple parking lots, free parking, easily accessible. Great place. Lots of natural beauty like trees, small man made ponds which usually have ducks in them and trails all throughout it."
This place is a beauty....
"Very fun park, lots to explore. My favourite pet is the lake river area. Cool lily pads and nice friendly ducks."
Biggest parc on the area with nice atmosphere in any season. Lake in the middle of parc Is one of significant place that can be surrounded with beautiful Bellevue..A lot of picnic areas with tables and barbecue installations... Bike rides are welcome
Many trees covering the trails. Quiet green space to walk or picnic. Close to Agrignon metro. Also has free parking on the de la verendrye entrance.

Autumn is the most colorful time in this park. It's really beautiful

Amazing Parc with some grills for barbecues ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Great Park for an early morning walk, big dog park, lots of picnic tables, all around a beautiful place to go right in the heart of the city"
peaceful and beautiful park. but hard to find washroom
It's nice. Big and beautiful. A little too much graffiti on signs but not that big of a deal.
Love to take a walk here so much memories!
Amazing nature spots and lots of room for human activity....
As always - good to walk there!
Very pretty place to visit in summer
"Huge park, with 2 ponds, great for long runs."
Gorgeous and a hidden oasis in Montreal. It is so beautiful with different spaces
"It's my happy place. Whenever i have to wait for bus 109, i just simply wait inside the park.... I think it's the best park in Montr√©al. It's just so perfect, there's a small pond, there are birds, places to sit, lush greenery,  etc. Etc. I love it."
"It's clean, cool. Best place to spend your free time, be free and proud to invite your friends or Montreal visitors to have time there."
"Great as always. During summer some people use a lot of tables, so if you want to get yourself one, arrive there early.
Lots of space, BBQs and tables.
Dog park and toys to play."
Beautiful park in Autumn
Angrignon  Park surely missed all the busily of last year.
Awesome place for families and friends to come hang out with an exceptional walk through the forest
"The park is large with many beautiful places especially near the water.   However, I had to look for them and frame them in a photograph to really appreciate a magnificent view.  It is a perfect place to walk peacefully in a nice surrounding.  The trees are magnificent, and some flowers can be seen around including in the water. There are many benches and picnic tables, however, on a bright Sunday afternoon the picnic tables may all be taken and the available benches may be available only in the sun. I also saw the odd barbeque place.  For the kids there is a play ground and for young adults there is enough grassy area to kick a ball.  There is a bus stop bordering the park, and a metro station not too far away.  I saw very few ducks in the water.  It is a pleasant place to relax."
Big community park in Verdun. Fun play gym for older kids.
"Nice place, soothing green in summer."
"Beautiful autumn colors, you can walk on many quiet trails around and through the park."
Very beautiful and good place
Marvellous huge nature in the heart of town where you can spend your whole day.  Unfortunately there is no any small coffee shop in it (or just we didn't find that).
Close to Angringnon metro station.Decent sized parking available nearby..Lots of walking trails for covering different stretches of park..Has a small kids playing area
Beautiful park for picnic or family gatherings....
Nice park to chill during summer time
Awesum
the best park in the city of four seasons. bbq and children's families are good together.
Great park and amazing place to exercise. Definitely one of my favorite parks in the city.
"Decent during the day but I wouldn't recommend walking trough the park past 7pm.
Lots of homeless and drug addicts are hiding in every corners despite the fact that security officers are patrolling the park at night."
This place is full with nature it peaceful and relaxing
"Very large park with BBQ areas including cinder disposal and picnic tables. You should bring your own BBQ stove. It's a good place to bring a large group to for events.

The park is clean has wooded areas and ponds, ducks can be seen there.

Some pathways cross woodland areas and loop around the park. Probably a good place to go for a jog."
Great üëçfor time spent
"Amazing park! It's a grear combination between feeling like you can be in the woods walking on a trail, or go on a walking trail by water, or even sitting in the sun in the grass. Such a great time!"
Cool
It‚Äôs good place for walking.
"Quiet and peaceful park, Great for BBQs during summer."
"Very pretty and expansive park, lots of different kinds of people visiting and going for walks :) The animals there are very tame! Not sure if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing, but it‚Äôs noteworthy"
"I live nearby and go there frequently. It's large and beautiful with lots of trees, birds and squirrels. I really love it. The only downside is that there are no restrooms available and if you go in the morning you will see beer cans near the pond."
Heaven on Earth üòé
Best runs!

Peace of heaven in the middle of the city. Beautiful trail around the lake.

"Really nice, big and spacious park, great for picnic and little outdoor parties/get togethers"
Just don't feed the birds... ;)
Great place for winter activities.
"A really beautiful oasis in the spring summer and fall, it's equally enjoyable in the winter as long as you have good traction on your footwear. The dog park can turn into an ice rink some days and the walking paths can get equally slippery. There's a nice play structure for the kids and is ajoining the metro. Free parking is available if you look for it."
One of the best parks in Montreal!
Beautiful park . Must when you visit in Montr√©al ‚úåÔ∏è

Nice place

"Beautiful walk, nice park with lots of space possibility for BBQ etc."
Need maintenance overall good place
"Nice park, spot whit public barbecue"
A lovely oasis for families. With some nice wildlife surprises.
It's just a nice place where families and friends could come together.
Beautiful huge park with a lot of tables however there is this weird smell from water
"Nice park. But the thing is, it has ghetto trails that don't really tell you where you are going. It would also help if there was a map board in key areas of the park to let you know where you are. This park is also great because its right when you get of the subway its right their. Also, since its Montreal, the sign is in French and there's no English to be found. C'mon Montreal put some English on your park signs, like its public place in Canada. I understood some but not all."
I love it
Beautiful place to walk with the family
Very nice
Very nice
"Beautiful park full of wildlife. The geese rest here during their southern migration from Canada in September. Lots of beautiful animals in their natural habitats, lots of long winding trails around large willows and ponds. We even saw a grey heron!"
"Nice park, with a lake which is dirty but you know, there are ducks."
I was just passing by to help a neighbour. No really great statement.

beautiful park and a great place to sit back and relax
One of my favorite parks.
"Used to live near the park and go for a run in the ‚Äúforest‚Äù. The air is fresher and its cool in the summer. The lake in the middle is a little disgusting, but there a path around you can take for a walk. There are lots of families going there on week ends which makes it alive and BBQ in he summer are popular there. You can walk around and sometimes find a group of 20 people enjoying music and a BBQ. It is a great quick escape from the city living!"
"nice park , I had great time today"
Beautiful paths in the woods to walk.
"Great place for a walk, jog or family picnic"
Nice city park to have a walk or run even you can pic.nic
Would be better with public restrooms.
Such a nice big parc to go for long stroll.
"Very loud on the week end. People do party's, and bring their loud sound systems. üòï"
Great huge park with bbq's and picnic tables
Beautiful any time of the year.
"Beautiful park, really nice place to take a walk or to have a picnic."
"Huge park with a lot of trees and three big lakes. Very accessible (metro, bus or car). Feels like the countryside in the city. Great place for a barbecue or to relax with your family."
I like that park. At least 4 times a year I spent time with my family and friends in that park for bbq and our national food PLOV
"A fantastic park in the city of Montreal, I recommend to visit this park specially in June and July"
Good place for bbq and dor kids as definitely I recommend it
Liked the lake and the walk
Nice park paradise in the city
Beautiful but be aware of black ice :)
Most beautiful at the beginning of Fall.
Excellent
Amazing park! I will go to enjoy it again!
"Lovely park, great for walks, picnics, and for kids."
"A wonderful journey into nature, right in the middle of our beautiful city !

Strolling through the numerous paths, enjoying the view, the astonishing greenery, the breeze, the peaceful silence mixed with families sounds and laughter, even hearing opera singers sharing their divine talent on a Sunday. It was/is all there, for our enjoyment, yet we often ignore these gifts, choosing social media or shopping malls. (not that there's anything terribly wrong with that...)
Angrignon Park is just a lovelier option, a moment to cherish, remember, and share. You will not regret the detour, plus it's free: bring a picnic basket, a banket to lie under the weeping willow by the water, and I promise that you will, just like we did, find yourself truly smiling, breathing again, grateful to be alive.
Someone is surely taking care of one of my new favorite spots: so THANK YOU to those City of Montreal workers!"
Great little park for a nice walk and to spot some wildlife.
Awesome place to run in! You can literally run around the park with various trails to take.
one of the best and biggest parcs in Montreal
Nice place to relax and walk around

"Great running trail, there is a dog park, a little lake. and BBQs or you can BYO"
Beautiful park
Nice clean park walk by the water and see the ducks and geese in their natural habitat or in the forest following a paved path. On site parking pay at the machine
"One of the most beautiful places to spend a summer day relaxing with friends or just on your own and one of the most peaceful as well. Plenty of parking and the easiest park in Montreal to access by public transportation with the Green Line of the metro beginning/ending right there. Plenty of BBQs free to use, just bring your own charcoal."
"Great place for all activities...Dogwalking, Children's parks, Pik-Nicking, jogging etc..."
"The park is very nice. It was overcrowded from the perspective of someone who lives in a small town. While BBQ parties are fun, 6 or 7 BBQ get together within 70 meters is past my sense of visiting nature. I would recommenced visiting between Tuesday and Friday."
Good and nice park
I am happy to live just next to this green spot on the map... :)
Large piece of greenery is always welcome. You can take a long peaceful walk.
Beautiful park and very dog friendly (though not technically almost everyone has their dogs off their leash)
My best place for hiking with my friends
Very nice park south of the center. You feel definitely not like in a city. Very good for running or walking. The squirrels are very funny. You can touch them if you give them nuts.
Bathrooms need to be demolished

"Beautiful park. In my opinion my favourite park in Montreal. It's such a big park with so many different places to walk, explore, picnic or have a BBQ."
Just experienced a great day snowshoeing: a very convenient and accessible place to do so in the city!

"Beautiful urban park in the South-West borough of Montreal.  It has some wildlife like skunks, raccoons and owls. In the summer, the park hosts a multitude of events  from concerts  to festivals and races.  If you wish, you can even find a secluded area to just chill!"
One of the best public parks in Montreal easily accessible by metro or car.nice lake picnic and BBQ facilities as well
Good place for biking with your family. Also BBQ party in summer.

"Great nature park in the middle of the city. Tons of geese, ducks, fish, etc, with lots of trails to hike. Only lost a star because there are tons of mosquitoes from May-September."
"This park needs better bathrooms facilities especially for families. As such, Angrignon park is rarely our first choice even though it's gorgeous overall"
"Pretty large,  with metro station."
"Nice large city park with bonus screech owls, birds which feed from your hand, and tons of cute squirrels."
üòÄ
"Located right next to Angrignon Metro makes getting here very easy ‚Äì there are multiple places to park (including a number of parking lots) ‚Äì we‚Äôve never had a problem with parking ‚Äì and access to the main paths from the parking lots (all of which have handicap spaces) makes it very easy to get into the park ‚Äì we usually enter via Boulevard de la Verendrye ‚Äì which brings you to the centre of the park very easily.

Because of the lake (big pond) and the enormous trees; this is one our favorite parks in the city to go for a walk in. This park is also incredibly large; in the winter we will frequently go snowshoeing here; its extremely peaceful in the winter.

It can get busy on the weekend in the summer, but the park is so large it can accommodate a lot of people.

Dog park, baseball field, running, biking. So much to do!"
"It is a Beautiful park. I love walking in the woods, its so peaceful. You can walk or bike in the summer months. Its clean and family friendly. I especially love it in the fall."
Amazing spot for a nice quick escape to nature
"The park offers a decent infrastructure with public washrooms, picnic tables and barbecues.
There‚Äôs a big green area and few lakes. There‚Äôs also a small dog park.
The park is just outside the Angrignon metro station and also has a parking space.

Cons: public washrooms close at 5p."
Good but too crowded
Good Place To Barbecue with the Family!
Very big and nice park
"Beautiful park year round. Only the main trail is plowed during winter. There is a big lake with ducks, playground for little and bigger kids, lots of comfortable benches, bathrooms during summertime, you can bring a charcoal for a picnic, free parking, small wildlife... great park! The main trail is about 2+ km around the lake, but there is off-the path gravel trails also. Police surveillance 24 h a day, feels safe"
Peaceful park with a lake at the center of the park. Oh yeah lake is not clean so don't try to swin. üòÇ
Beautiful park especially this time of year with the leaves starting to change color. Even more so in probably a week or so when it will be at its peak.
"A great park with many different areas for lots of different activities simultaneously. Family BBQ, wedding reception, many more outdoor events you may want to organise. Park is operated by the LaSalle borough."
I recommend this place

"Nice to take walk, to bike, to do BBQ"
"Beautiful and big park with trails, picnic tables, bbq‚Äôs and charcoal disposal bins. Held our company picnic for a second year."
"This is a really lovely park in the middle of a busy urban setting. I went there to take some pictures, not expecting much, and was very pleasantly surprised. There is an extensive system of paths for pedestrians and cyclists, and many beautiful spots that just beg to be photographed. It also has an area where you can set up grills and have cookouts, as well as a play area for children. Overall a great place to enjoy a bit of nature right near a busy metro station."
Love how big it is and how everything is covered in green. It's also really easy to get by public transit. Great whooping big trees for reading in the shades and nice bicycle lanes. The air is good as it's adjacent to a lake. There also is a playground deep inside.
Great park for a walk or relaxing afternoon in the sun.  BarBQ and bathrooms  are available.
One of my favorite parks to do a BBQ. Free parking if you go to the Boulevard de la Verendrye entrance. There's plenty of picnic tables to choose from but they are a little close to one another. There are BBQ stations you just need to bring your own charcoal. They have portable toilets available as well. Perfect place to spend summertime with the fam!
GREAT PLACE TO DO CROSS COUNTRY SKIING.
"Very lovely park to bring the family for a picnic! There are mini lacs and picnic tables scattered everywhere throughout this huge park. A dog park, a children park, ducks, birds and so much more to relax or have fun."

Angrignon Park (French: Parc Angrignon) is a large park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. Angrignon Park has a total area of 97 hectares.
The park is named for Jean-Baptiste Angrignon (1875-1948), a longtime city councillor in C√¥te Saint-Paul.
The park was inspired by the design of 19th-century English gardens. The park contains 20,000 trees, winding paths and a pond surrounded by cattails.
The park is located just south of Ville-√âmard, east of Carrefour Angrignon, which is also named after Jean-Baptiste Angrignon, and west of Verdun.
En 1944, on projette d'am√©nager un zoo d'importance dans le parc. Dix ans plus tard, la firme am√©ricaine d'architectes paysagers et ing√©nieurs McFadzean, Everly and Associates √©labore un programme complet. Le zoo serait dot√© de b√¢timents √† l'architecture symbolique inspir√©e des esp√®ces animales. Sur ce terrain de 250 acres (plus de 100 hectares soit plus d'un km2), agr√©ment√© d'une s√©rie de bassins, les animaux donneraient l'impression de circuler en libert√©. Bien qu'il ne soit r√©alis√© qu'en partie, le zoo accueille, chaque hiver, les animaux du Jardin des merveilles du Parc Lafontaine jusqu'en 1989, alors qu'ils sont d√©finitivement relocalis√©s au moment de la fermeture du Jardin des merveilles."
"Nicely located right next to a metro station makes it easy to get to by public transit. By car there is plenty of parking however it is paid parking which is strange that you need to pay when outside the city even on a weekend. The park is OK, it is nice to have a large space to throw events but not a very nice park overall compared to the Mont Royal. However even with all that it is always great to have such a large green space for those nearby."
Great place for a walk or a run or a picnic. Wear footwear that doesn't mind wet conditions. It is still quite wet.
"Good looking park to walk and share in family. BBQ allowed and available. All green, very clean and friendly."
"Good place to relax, picnics, and BBQ. The park is huge so pick your spot and enjoy."
Beautiful park ideal for bbqs and picnics with friends and family.  Should have better cleaner bathrooms.
"Great for running short distances. A loop of the park is about 3.5k but with all the trees and trails that you can take through them, it feels way longer. The jogging trail that I found was mostly made of crushed stone so this is good for absorbing the shock from your knees."
Great park for little kids big kids adults nature washrooms and public transport near by
"Very restful, nice place to sit and relax,enjoy eating a bring it yourself lunch."
Full of life ‚òÄÔ∏è
"A great place to clear your mind, especially at off-peak times in the evening."
If you want to feel like you've left the city nice place to relax in nature
"Great place for picnics, family time or just walk around"
Love this park. Nature walking so close to home.
Loved the place ... it was really nice and clean place... I recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax and chill.
"We spent the night in our camper van in the parking lot next to the M√©tro station.  Parking costs $12 (CAD) for 24 hours.  We took the M√©tro downtown for sightseeing and dining.  Next morning, took the M√©tro to McGill U Health Center for an appointment.  Overnight parking and 24 hour M√©tro ticket is an inexpensive way to park your camper, enjoy Montreal, take care of business, and avoid traffic.  Only rated the park 4 stars because there wasn't a good public bathroom close to the parking lot, just some porta-potties.  The lot was quiet overnight."
My favorite place since I was a young kid. Cool to see that many different ethnic group sharing this park. I highly recommend to anyone to go for a stroll and enjoy this quiet spot.
Great place to bring kids or to have a bbq
Nice
Really great place to relax
I liked the weather there
One of the best parc in Montreal to spend time with friends or family . Barbecue or to relax.. recommend it

Beautiful place
"The parc is great but could be more clean... I know people throw trash everywhere, but all other parcs I went in Montreal are cleaner than this one."
"Ideal park to get away from the city while staying in the city.
This park is perfect for an hour walk. The main spot to see is the big lake in the middle.
All around the park there are spots to relax and BBQ.
Usually in the summer the place is full of families and university students BBQing.
Definitely worth a visit."
"Wide nice and quiet. An ideal place to reconnect with nature. The only drawback would be in the summer there are countless barbecues and it smells from afar. But if this does not bother you, OK"
very relaxing day
Really cool park but the building in front is kinda creepy.
Great place to walk around with your pet. They have tons of picnic tables and you can do bbq. It is a beautiful place
Love this park.
"Great park! Love visiting it here, nice for runs and super cute. Close to the metro line and everything and soo peaceful it's just so nice to visit"
Nature so close to the city
"We went there in Winter, was a nice experience see my first winter landscape! We go for a walk around park, and was cold, but not so much so we could see all of it without hesitation."
Windy but nice
"Great park with a couple of pretty lakes, great place for a run or a picnic. Not nearly as busy as most larger parks in Montreal. Love it!"

Fun place to  visit  lot  of trees  and animals
Nice trails. Well maintained.
"Definitely a gem in the city of Montreal. Don't miss visiting if you want to go hiking or picnicking, and especially if you don't have a car to drive out of the city to explore nature. This is, along with Parc de Mont-Royal, the place to go for those seeking greenery and natural serenity in a city."
Nice park
"Cute little park, great for morning walks!"
"Great for picnic, running, family time, biggest park in area"
"In the Summer time, it's the best place to visit.
Want some alone time?
Time with your family?
Go on a date?
A barbecue with a group?
Running?
Walking?
Skate boarding?
Roller blading?
Or just want to see a peaceful sunset?
The Angrignon Park is the place to visit.
It's very big and you never feel some body else is in your personal space.

So, next time you are in LaSalle (Montreal) Quebec, visit it.

Highly recommended if you want to do Zumba, picnic, yoga!

There is so much you can do!

Once you get off Metro Station Angrinon, you are right there!"
"My favorite park in Montreal. It's easy to get here with public transportation from anywhere in the city: End station Metro, green line, Angrignon. Within the park you can walk around a natural lake and with some luck you will be able to spot animals you may not expect. My highlights: Painted Turtle and Great Blue Heron."
Has a fenced dog park but can be very muddy at times but good local community of good dogs
"Wonderful little park with ducks. Take the green line to the end, you won't regret it!"
Very nice
Its wonderful place to do sports
Best place to do Tai Chi
"Lots of trees. If you like trees, go here."
It's a nice place
Beautiful
"Very beautiful nature around you. One of the best places to visit in Montreal and especially, Lasalle. Staff is always cleaning tables and the territory around. There are some bbq spots available where you can come make your grill without bringing you own stuff."
Best park mtl lots of activities and space
Nice quiet place. Good for meditation.
"Disappointing!
Only one male bathroom to attend everyone (men, women, kids) in the park. Only one portable potty (out of service) that has not been cleaned for weeks.
What's going on??????
It's summer time Montr√©al!!??????"
Nature & relaxing
Great natural spot winter or summer. Family friendly.
night comes  mosquitos comes    barely any lights
good
"This green park has changed so much since I was a kid. Use to have a huge gravel parking lot. But not anymore. You have the choice to park off of des trinitaire street or laverendry, make sure you park on the laverendry side as it is free. The only downfall is it is further to the lake than on les trinitaire."
Amazing
Beautiful scenery in autumn. But parking is not free.
The best place for everyone!
Parc is good but washroim is closed and they out iutside bix but very smelly you cannit used it.
Nice walk....
Cool place

Lovely park
"Nice for a run in the summer, but very long grass - could use a cut maybe. Overall decent park."
"Great place to have a bbq and chill but a complete lack of signage. I mean, the parcel extends on 3 sides so label them east, west and south. Just that would be helpful."
"It is a very big park which is really beautiful. It is good for all people. Great place for walking, biking and bbq."
Nice park but too much goose poop

Nice pond and walkways. Parking is abundant but u have to pay. Street parking is available.  Bathrooms are really far and 1 Porto bathroom available which is nasty. More bathrooms!!

"Huge park with Cycle path and ample space for picnics/BBQ and activities. One set back was that the Men's restroom was closed today, near the place where we had a picnic."
Perfect place to enjoy and relax. And have a free mind from this tiring and stressful work.
Hi AL peapole. Thank you for wach

"We paid 10$ for the parking and we were very disappointed. Not so much tables, barely couple of BBQ to use, we had to go and buy one at Canadian tire. The street was just 1min away, the noise from the cars and buses was constant. So much better parcs in Montreal where the parking is free and more tables."
Really nice place to relax and watch beautiful scenery

C‚Äôest beau l√†-bas
"Nice park, but it gets crowded after early morning. The walkways could use some TLC and would be nice to have more benches. The Adirondack chair on top of the hill is a nice touch. should have more of those to enjoy the top of the hill view."
A very nice and  refreshing place. So quiet and clean environment. One would always want to be there.
"Enjoyed the sliding! Lovely little park! I noticed a little round skating ‚õ∏ area, i will definitely try it out! Fun park for kids, family and adults that are young at heart ‚ù§üíôüòÜüòÅ"
"One side of the hill is steeper and has slushy parts, the other side is not as smooth. There's also an icy path you can slide down without a sled, just watch out for slow kids and the posts protecting a young tree."
Great park to hang out with a beautiful view
"nice, but quite small park"
A good park suitable for kids
"Love this parc, great for kids and love the hill to run up and down on."

Very small park to sit and rest.
Beautiful park named for a beautiful human being. Dr. Daisy Peterson Sweeney was special.
"I took my wife for a walk there because she has been dying to see the Tulip Garden there,,, which was beautiful by the way. There must have been at least 1000 tulips,,, if not more. Peace out and Pay it Forward everyone."
"Great place to lie in the grass, draw on a bench, or be reminded of Montreal's past.

Looks incredible when the fall leaves come. Nice place to watch the marmots play in the dandelions :)"

Beautiful park full of trees

Nice place
My best friend daughter is crazy of that park
Nice little park with activity centers for all ages.
Very good Parc and clean

Love doing my exercise here!

Has lots of potential. Will change this rating once the city start the proposed projects.

Very nice and qiet park. Not big but very good for relaxing and making a bbq.
This place is magnificent and safty place to enjoy the nature
Great place for a stroll.
"My kids love this park, specially the swing chair located closed to the river."
Beautiful park
Nice scenic view on lake Saint-Louis
"It is a bare bones park: no swings, slides, bathrooms, or big attractions.

BUT

It has a stunning view, beautiful waterfront picnic spots, picnic tables, and you can park right close to your spot.

Sunsets and fishing are common attractions almost everyday. People will either fish or sit romantically enjoying the setting sun.

The park joins with a series of paths that lead all around the island. It's truly a stellar place to run, bike, or meander."
"Its nice ,, but there shouldnt be allowed people letting their dogs loose in the park. I left after 20 mins."
Nice park to have a nice bbq while enjoying the views. They have picnic table so just bring your food and your portable bbq and you can have a splendid time.
Nice green space. Small but quiet and just off the beaten path.

Great little Park fir kids toddlers aged 1-9
It's a park. Nice.
Very nice
Best dog park in Montr√©al! Don‚Äôt @ me. Also: I only took videos at the park so enjoy these simply MAJESTIC screen grabs of all the fun your dog and you are missing.
"Great medium sized dog park right in Montreal. The water fountain works again, so bring a bowl for your furry friend."
Nice and cozy. Great place to walk your dog.
"Friendly  service,  good food ,great beer and a well stocked bar."
"It's a great dog park. Finally something useful for the tax dollars!

However, a couple of caveats:
- If you go there late, lights won't turn on until it's been dark for an hour or so. They'll be on during the night, though.
- There's always a bad apple or two, even among the dog owners. You'll always have to look after your dog or he/she will get bitten, humped or both.
- Not all of the owners pick up after their dogs (one even angrily yelled at me that dog excrements belong in the dog park, he's not the one to disturb natural order of things), so better look at your feet while you're walking around!
- The park has no different sections for different sized dogs, which just means you'll have to be even more careful if your dog is tiny.

Anyway, overall it's a great park with a great community. Almost all of the regulars are decent people with nice and well-behaved dogs."
Large and clean. Lots of room for the doggies to play.
"I love it here, my baby boy absolutely loves it too!"
Great space for dogs and their owners.
Big nice place for good dogs and peeps
"this place is like a dog heaven, you can unleash your waggly friend so he/she can run freely and play with other wagglies ;-)  there are many benchs so people can sit and relax , you and your dog always can mingle with other humans or dogs here üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è"
Everyone is so nice at the dog park. You can play with most dogs and no one will think twice about it. Really nice place. Truly an hidden gem of Montreal.
The best dog park in downtown Montreal! Both people and dogs are really friendly! I have been bringing my puppy since he was 11 weeks old ! Even the large dogs were so friendly with him
This park is huge and there‚Äôs always a lot of dogs from really early in the morning until late at night. Our dog loves going there!
Awesome little park in the city.  Came in for a week of food and fun and stayed near the mountain. A short walk down the street and here we were.  One of the best urban dog parks I've been too and Bernie liked it too! Would stay in the area again for this perk alone.
Good dog community
"Good place to leave the dogs running free for a while. But I agree with some people who are be complaining about the bad park organization. There is no separate area for puppies and, often, people leaves their dogs alone there. Such recklessness and lack of respect may cause a serious incident. If you really love your dog, don't leave him alone in the park, not even for a little while."
Amazing dog park!
Best dog park in Montreal. Fenced with benches and lots of space for the doggos.
"The best dog park in the city. Green, big, and beautiful!"
A Good place for kids and families
"One of the best dog runs in Montreal, well maintained water is readily available and lots of room for your dog to run around"
"A beautiful park in the middle of the Golden Mile. Used to be one contiguous affair, seemingly just for Fido. About a decade ago the park got new love, still ongoing, and was realistically split in two, homosapiens, canines, and indigenous fauna...
Unabashedly best dog park in the world. PLEASE PICK-UP!
Children (monkey gym), parents, and workers can enjoy a noble piece of land. Thanks Percy. There used to be a stone wall, some of that should stay."
"Great DOG PARK with volunteers who really care about the place. Well kept - clean, green, and very open. Mostly only well trained dogs and nice owners come here! Good for dogs of all sizes, with many places to sit, and a water fountain that works in the summer"
"Excellent dog park in the city. Very good size. Had people there maintaining it. Should have a double gate though, as someone left it open while we were there. Luckily no dogs escaped. Water fountain wasn't working as it was winter already. Barely any parking when we went, but it was clearing up as we left. Good place for you dogs to visit"
"One of the biggest, nicest dog parks in the city. It can be a bit of a pain to park, but the size, terrain, and number of dogs more than make up for it. There are benches for the humans and there's water for the dogs. What more could you ask for?"
"Big dog park at the foot of Mont Royal hill, on Dr Penfield. Big area for your dog to run around!"
Small park at the foot of Mont Royal. Stopped here for a break after walking downhill from the Mont Royal observation deck. The park is clean but has no notable amenities.
"Big and grassy with a good amount of shade.  I found a lot of the people strange.  I are irate that one woman regularly gardens and cleans the park HOWEVER she is abusive towards the dogs that she babysits and brings to the park! DO NOT leave your dog with her. I have seen her hit and yell at many of her dog clients.
I wouldn‚Äôt go back very quickly."
Great playground in the heart of downtown
"This park is the best. Good people, great dogs, best vibes~."
"Very unkept park.
MASSIVE holes under the fence (enough for a golden retriever to escape into the busy street), the entrance door doesn't open from the inside so you have to contortion your way to the lock, metal wires sticking out of the ground, half the park is closed off, no water available.
Full of pretentious dog owners who won't let the dogs play together and don't pick up after their dog."
"Best dog park in Montreal its massive, and has one end that looks like woods. Dog owners are respectful and overall great ambiance"
Best dog park in Montreal and greater Montreal
"Great park, the dogs can socialize without any problem and the owners are very friendly."
Great üëç‚ù§
Could use a separate small dog section . And a public washroom.
"Yes this is a big park with lots of space to let your dogs run around. However this dog park needs to be better organized or regulated. Dog owners come and leave their dogs to run around without any oversight. We saw 15-20 dogs running around and only 5-6 people in the park. There needs to be a small dog sectioned off area. Our small puppy got attacked by an aggressive German Shepard who kept trampling on him and biting him. Thank god I was right near my pup and was able to wrestle him away after a few minutes.

When we yelled whose german Shepard this was, No one would claim him. Someone told us it belongs to an old guy but he was nowhere in the park.

Long story short- big park but beware of irresponsible dog owners with aggressive dogs because it is an off leash park."
Best off leash dog park in downtown area. Offers shade and benches for humans and a good grassy hill and water for the dogs.
Run puppy Ruuuuuuuuuuuuun!!!
Great dog park with high fences.
Great off-leash dog park! Our puppy loves it there
"Spacey, clean. Overall great for the afternoon walk"

"Good place to bring your dog to play, but the regulars that go there can be suspicious of new people and a little snotty"
Best dog park in town
good
Nice for walk
My car window was smashed and computer stolen (parked on Pine)
Perfect for dogs
Best dog park in Montr√©al
Best dog park in mtl
I didn't realize there was a kiddie skate park here as well! Great atmosphere and friendly (socially-distanced) folks!
Big enough to find and enjoy activity you want. My kids adore this place! There are a lot of kids there at good weather evening ‚ò∫üòé
Great place for playing Pokemon go.
"Cute park with two playground sections. One for the smaller kids around 6 and below. The other offers a more challenging and fun ""jungle gym"" for bigger kids. It also has a nice hockey rink and they rent skates."
Cool I liked it
"Awesome park. However, i think both  playground for kida needs a do over ASAP. Also, the sands needs to be removed."
"Great pool in the summer.
Canadian skating ring in winter.
Basketball court and fun park for the kids"
A great place for children
nice rink and soccer field
"Canadiens outdoor rink just great for the family,  free skating"
They have a super nice hockey Rin
"Nice place.  Soccer field needs bleachers.  Not much place to park, especially with all the construction 6/2017"
"It has a very nice playground to play soccer, many different things for kids to play, a swimming pool, tennis playground and skating playground."
A very good place to spend time with friends during summer time. With an outdoor pool and basketball court. LA Maison des Jeunes (MDJ) is also located there for some indoor fun with various activities. It doesn't stop there as in the winter the basketball court is transformed into a skating rink for the people  to continue the Canadian traditions of skating and playing ice hockey.
"I love this park, it's been my favorite since childhood"
Nice parc for family fun with activities
The pool is good but too crowded

My favorite spot to read books and enjoy pleasant weather. Great way to get your steps in and stay active.
Nice option to spending time with friends keeping the social distancing
Nice place to chill or train bring your bands or do some aerobics or high intensity training. Nice chair to lounge and chat or Sun bath during summer
Nice clean park.
"A great spot to relax by the Lachine Canal, right beside the bicycle trail. Large chairs to relax in facing the mountain, nice sculptures of bird silhouettes dot the sky, assorted wild grasses, a few picnic tables, movies in the park once a week in the summer evenings (french only). There's a microbrewery steps away with a terrace. The new REM train will pass by here when it's done, but it won't stop here. The VIA passenger rail train going East also passes over the canal here."
"Very pleasant stop during your bike tour along the canal to, or from, the Old Port. Great view, especially at night. By all means take the bike path into the Port, don't go onto Wellington with your bike.

Manicured grounds and seating. Nice view."
It's a beautiful and peaceful place
Its ok nice walks. Theres some where you can chill but again im not familiar with saint square rent bike shop more can be done with the area not much to say on this part.
"I'm a photographer and I like to take pictures in this park. You can go by sunrise and the sunset to get better pictures. The place is beautiful so there's lots of photos opportunities you can get. Bring your kids and pets if you like. Summer time is really popular, lots of people go to relax and enjoy the view. Go this next spring!"
Nice and clean park
Nice spot to enjoy the water and a little less busy than old port. You can enjoy free movie nights during summer
Nice park located on the other side of the canal Lachine. Face to face with Griffingtown. The park is small. But during summer it projects some great movie during the evening.
Simply put: ¬´¬†nice¬†¬ª
"It's ok place to sit down and relax after a long walk along the canal, especially if you have the young children or pets with you (we take our cat). We usually take a sit there before continuing exploring the place. In summer you can lay down on the grass, there are also big chairs and some picknick tables with benches. We have a snack there or bring our lunch to eat outside. Some people excercise with trainer on the square."
"Great park, definitely recommend when it's sunny outside"
Great place to unwind
"Lovely spot to catch some rays, watch the canal, maybe see some ducks!"
"Nothing great here, loud traffic nearby. You're better off walking along the canal and finding a better spot if you want to chill."
Great place to relax after a workout.
Very nice but too hot in summer since there are no large trees or structures
üëå ok
Movie night Mondays
Best in the Montr√©al
"It',s ok"
Quiet next to the canal
Follow the movie nights.
Enjoyed the place
I mostly go to this park it's less crowded. Especially during  this pandemic it is.  their in  It's peaceful and nature is always. I love taking photos.
"Really nice park with water games, soccer and basketball courts"
"Nice place, good module for kids of all ages"
"Convenient sports park with playing fields ,drinks and a swimming complex."
"Good park, but they have to do something about the basketball court and add some facilities for teenagers. Basketball court is slippery, they don't put the lights at night while hockey players always have the court with the lights. Would have been better if there were horizontal bars for calisthenics because can't find any around NDG."
Great park with lots of kids games.
Good quality ice. It is cleaned by a Zamboni machine the same way an indoor arena is cleaned. There are no lockers  in the nearby  chalet. I wish they played some music for the skaters like they do at Beaver Lake.
Good playground and ice rink
Nice place for the dog to run around.
Horrible.
Great park with safer playground than most of the other parks in the area. It's still accessible during winter and the little ones' section is acceptable to kids with special needs !
"A wonderful park with something of interest for almost anyone. Unfortunately, the ice skating arena is closed for renovations from April 2019 to April 2020, and the hockey rink/basketball court behind seems to be blocked off too."
Great local outdoor pool. Free to use and open all summer. Plenty of space. Clean and well maintained
Lovely park with playground
Great place! Love the playground.
"400m runing track, football play ground, public pool, kids play ground, basketball play ground,"
"This park has everything your family needs to have fun:
A public pool and splash pads that open at the end of June so that's before most of all other pools in the city.
One external and one internal hockey ar√©nas.
A small mound to go sledding when big snow falls.
A 400 m running track I go to jog to every morning, surrounding a soccer field.
And a small kids (not enclosed) and big kids park."
My kids love this park.
"This spot is perfect for runners. Easy to get to and gives a nice, well maintained track.

Has a pokemon go gym and 4 stops."
"A very nice spot for exercises in the neighborhood. A pool in the summer, an ice rink in the winter and a cool playground for the kids. Close to bus 51."
Nice place to visit during summer
Great skating ring in winter!
"Good neighbourhood to live in. Highly recommended for family, with school, library, park and pool."
Great Park. Discovered the gravel track this year which is better for my joints. Free buz along the run along the evening hrs too;)
Nice location
"Cool place for sports, free Swimming pool all summer, Ice skating rink , basket ball hoops , parc for kids"
U can never get board when ur here
Love it so much variety
Great ice rink for free skating and pickup hockey with a fairly safe sledding hill.
"Running track is great, adult friendly but it‚Äôs not as clean as it should be for children, lots of construction waste, garbage.."
Dog park
Like the park but needs to be cleaneda. It's of garbage and cigarette buds

Amazing place for the family.
"Not a ton to do, but nice area"
Their bagels rock! Don't know what I would do without them!
Very nice parc
"One of my frequent go-to places in downtown Montreal is Dorchester Square. When I get tired of shopping in the underground city or walking around Ste-Catherine, I find a bench and take a break. The square is situated north and south of Rene-Levesque Boulevard. Stick to the northern part for people-watching or go to the southern part if you prefer a less frequented area. There are several businesses east and west of the square, but some are in dilapidated buildings that could use a renovation."
A beautiful spot to sit back and relax in the heart of downtown. Very well maintained. Lots of space and seating.
"Nice place in the middle of the  city to get out and stretch your legs after a long.train ride. It's one street.over from the VIa rail station and offers sunlight after darkness for so long. Beautiful tanning corners all over the place if all the benches are taken and was a nice spot to see a few historical buildings and monuments while waiting for the next train. Was interesting to see how the green color from the copper roofs leaked down the side of the building. Cannon was cool too and your close to the montreal Canadiens stadium too! Tonight is game 04 of the second series, there's a buzz in the air as a chance for the sweep looms!"
Nice little quiet park in the middle of a busy city! Very clean and well taken care of!
"Dorchester Square is a really nice park, well taken care of by the city. Accessible from the Peel metro very easily. Lots of benches, greenery, monuments. Good for photos or to just sit around/take a walk."
A nice park downtown. Has many benches where you can sit and relax or enjoy your lunch break. There's also trees which provide some shaded areas.
"A nice garden walk in the middle of the city. With a lot of trees, I feel refreshing after a walk here."
"I recommend to visit this spot asap, it's really gorgeous with gorgeous red flowers surrounding the statue"
At Montreal centre. Easy to reach by all transportation means . Meeting point out door.
Powerful March for Rebecca love.  Rest in paradise
"It's nice but badly designed. If you walk here in the winter, the tiles on the floor get quite slippery."
Nice place but the city needs to step up their cleaning.. trash cans always overflowing..
Nice place but lots of birds what makes the place a bit dirty
"It's where I skateboard, it's like the closest, decent place from my house, it's nice usually no problem skating, can accommodate up to maybe 50 skaters on both sides of all ability level, from grass ollies to curved ledge down a 15 set, also a big overpass to get manuals and stuff.  Ground is uneven it's like small tiles, but I find that's an advantage, though skatepark skaters probably will find the ride pretty bumpy, I recommend ditch wheels, but even park wheels are fine, just a bit slow.

Just my go-to skatepark near where I live...  Pretty chill crowd come here, too.  I like it...  *shrugs*"
It‚Äôs a square with statues and benches. Fun to walk around and it‚Äôs big so you‚Äôre not close to anyone during the pandemic.
Super chill park with a nice design. Great place to rest when wandering the city.
"It is great to see the north section of the square finished with the two Bridges and the incomplete cut off fountain. This is an excellent work of my favorite landscape architect, Claude Cormier. In a Sunday afternoon at the beginning of Autumn the place was a perfect postcard: young families with strollers, tourists taking pictures and squirrels running and jumping around. The trees were showing hints of what is going to be their coloring in a few weeks time. A great place to start a downtown discovery walking tour."
This park is located around everything.. bars.. restaurants.. hotels.. etc... it's right in the heart of downtown area(st Catherine downtown area).. i suggest checking it out at least once as u will get a look at montreal's downtown at the same time! Theres paid parking around or u can easily access it through public transportation
Amazing place to relax and chill!
Beautiful park! Great place to relax and have a coffee and people watch!
Enjoy the new installations arched staircases and the demi fountain. Woody's on the fountain.
Nice place to sit and relax.. But a lot of pot smokers
"I love the location of Dorchester square, specifically how it is in the center of the city. The square is very vast with a lot of sitting area. It is also a great place for pictures!! There is a monument surrounded by historic buildings. There is also a water fountain, adding to the aesthetic views!"
Beautiful awesome place to sit and relax!üíû
Good place to relax
Nice place to walk around
"Location of Place du 50e, with food trucks and some F1 and grand prix stuff this weekend. Usually it's a nice square with a fountain and benches. Nice spot for a park in the middle of the city."
Very tiny but beautiful and can just drop by while walking along the street of downtown in Montreal.
"Since the renovation, its cleaner, safer and nicer."
"I love this place. I go there with my wife. A good place to have some quality time with near ones. Good number of birds and small animals play there. If you live in montreal, this is must go place"
Perfect little place to chill and also for a little working it
A great place to hold a protest
"Lovely park to spend lunch time in, to sit on the grass with friends, or to sit on a bench and relax. There are often 1 or 2 food trucks nearby. Dorchester Square often holds small events in the summer such as Formula One in June and free music concerts, where small business will be present to promote, and where food stops and bars are available."
Great place for a peaceful protest against the violence in Gaza and elsewhere!
"pleasant, clean, not too many people"
It's a nice park. Lots of benches in the middle of a concrete jungle. I go sit often and enjoy a coffee and the scenery. Thumbs up.
Beautiful views of downtown Montreal and great place to appreciate nature in the city. Definitely my favourite spot in downtown Montr√©al.
The park is pretty with the bridges and monuments but the crowd there is sometimes best avoided.
Nice people watching spot surrounded by beautiful buildings. It is also a good place to contemplate life and pay respects to the Montrealers from past who are buried under the square.
Spectacular place with a piece of history
"More like dorkchester square ü§£ü§£ tbh

- plateaubaddies"
Small park but great views
The place is unique as well as historical. It is located in downtown of Montreal. The main thing I like about this is the fountain that is cut into half. Other buildings here are very beautiful as there is old architecture on one side and modern on another. It is mesmerizing.
Cute square
Some shady characters in this park.
Nice relaxing area
Nice park in the middle of downtown. They just added 2 bridges at the NE and NW corners of the park.
The place needs more garbage and recycling bins.
"One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal. Whether you're just passing through or a long-time resident, it's a place to stop and, sitting on a park bench, admire the magnificent architecture of the Sun Life building. There are often free aminations in the summer and there are street food trucks that provide a quick bite to eat."
New construction really improved this park 1000% ü•∞
Began well situated park right in the heart of Montreal with a wonderfully bronze sculpted horse and soldier representing many British domion wars the valiant French and English Canadians fought with courage and passion for God and country. It also happens to be the first Montreal cementary 1769 to 1865 it moved on the south west side of the glorious Mont-Royal! You will notice the crosses with a strange ending inbedded and strewn about the square. BTW there is a Victorian drinking fountain you can not miss it it is quite unique facing the neo classical Sunlife building it's hard to not see it.
"Dorchester square is dead center in the middle of Montreal practically and steps away from everything you want to visit and check out while you're in the city.

One of my personal favorite things to do close to Dorchester square is to visit the Queen Elizabeth brunch on Sunday afternoons, trust me if you haven't experienced the brunch it's a total treat.

Saint Catherine Street is steps away from Dorchester square and an amazing place to go shopping and get your fix for designer brands and great deals on the strip."
"Its is a really nice park, there's a lot of restaurants near it as well"
Very nice place to sit and relax but there's still junkies
Decent place to hang out for a while
A beating heart of of Montr√©al's vibe. A nice place to enjoy a break from concrete jungle.
"One of the best parks in Montreal, quiet and well decorated, a good place to read a book peacefully"
"It's amazing place. I was there for almost half an hour and trust me it's an amazing place to sit down and talk to your loved once. You can really feel inner peace there, though you still can hear the noise of traffic but over the square is highly recommended to visit once if you are in Montreal"
Clean and mostly safe
I was here last year on spring and then again today. The squirrels were still there and the colorful flowers. It was good sitting on the benches for a quick rest.
Beautiful urban square. Many squirrels.
Decent place to have lunch on a lovely day. Decent choice of restaurants around for take out
"Amazing place to be, i love it always reading my books there and enjoy the weather."
"Historic Building. Basement safe was transformed into a ""jail dungeon"" in the past."
Excellent place
Nice day for the park.
"A green park in the middle of downtown Montreal with some status and chairs and trees . Very nice place to eat your lunch or rest a little or have your work break. Also as RDV place. If you're visiting Montreal and want to rest a little from your downtown tour , go there. It's also a nice place to take pictures."
"Waiting for a friend. Hitchhiked Vancouver-St John‚Äôs Newfoundland. So often we think that happiness is a destination, when I make a million dollars or when I buy a new car I will be happy. Rather we need to be happy with what we have, and not postpone our happiness thinking we will get the time to focus on joy later. Pondering as we wait. Journey can take times dorchester square is the place to be when waiting. Highly recommended spot out of Canada. Top 10 places to take a day nap or enjoy a book, smoke a joint if it rains movie theatre is next block."
"Public park near to the Cath√©drale, nice place"
Beautiful mini park right in downtown Montreal.
"A place where is in the middle of the downtown of Montreal. Easily accessible to all the pedestrian. Or else people who want to relax and sit for a while to enjoy the surrounding area. It looks good to be there. Because it is all surrounded by the trees and sitting benches for the people. I do not like the people sleeping on the benches kept for the people to sit on. I think that, people who do not have home they come and spend their most of their time sitting on the benches or sleeping. This can create a issue for others who want to sit there. If we have some food with us then peacocks and other birds will come to join the party. If we give some food to them."
Beautiful place
Not bad
Place with great views. Beautiful garden as well.
nice small parc in the middle of downtown Montreal
Peaceful place to sit and spend time with friends or family
Always nice
Very nice
"If i am at work and they give me a break! I buy a sandwich and a juice and bam! Dorchester square.. it is a tiny oasis of peace in a crazy traffic zone.
When it is sunny, i like to listen to this talented guitarist singing behind the memorial monument. I also, enjoy watching that old lady doing her Taichi routine. Often a group of women join her casually moving with that calming music... i feel relaxed and i say to myself... Montreal is so beautiful. Thanks to all the persons who made this place available to all of us."
Very nice place to visit on your lunch break.
nice park at downtown montreal.
"It's the heart of downtown üçÅMONTREAL‚ù§

"Nice place but very dirty, with lots of hooligans and homeless people"
"Beautiful park.A lovely place to chill at. Super friendly pigeons.Fully renovated!Lovely open, green space in the middle of Downtown Montreal."
Historic location in Montreal next to amazing restaurants (dominion square tavern is a must next door) and iconic landmark ( bank building in front for photos ops) a plus there is a subway station near it and a 2 minutes walk from st-Catherine street for shopping and entertainment

Very beautiful nice place
Wonderful place !
"It's definitely a well maintained square! Had approximately 6"" of snow yesterday and the walkways have been cleared of the snow, lots of benches to choose from to take in the view.
Bonus there is a lot of free Highway Coach parking around the park it self, perfect if you don't want to fight with traffic and construction road closures."
Nice park in the middle of a busy city! Great little escape on your lunch break as well if you work near! Check out the pix!
"The food was excellent, but they've made the decision not to allow any modifications. Not unreasonable from the chef's perspective, but some flexibility would make it even better. Wine selection is fantastic!"
"Relatively clean park, well located in the middle of downtown. Large area, multiples places to sit and hang out.

Often has pokemon raids. Many people go there for the raids."
Good place to relax and eat lunch if you work downtown.
"Love this park--- so central to downtown. You can go from shopping or work or whatever to sitting on the grass with a bottle of dep wine in 10 minutes. Great place to meet friends, kill some time, or just relax in the sun."
Very nice park in the middle if the city.
"Beautiful stop to sit, rest and enjoy the colors of fall. This square is the most romantic in fall."

Nice place to spend good time with family
Greatand beautiful park to enjoy some nature in the middle of downtown.

"An attractive, people-friendly park in the heart of Montreal. So great to see people enjoying the outdoors! Lovely landscaping, flowers and monument. Thank you, Montreal!"
Amazing small park in the middle of downtown. Ideal for relaxing with a nice iced tea during the summer.

It is a tranquil place to sit and energize. I was there on a Saturday afternoon. There are benches that are in good shape. The park was clean. There is grassy areas around the park. There is also a half circular stairs the climb up and climb down. It is interesting and fun for the kids. Overall a nice downtown park. It is right next to the Sun Life building. I l would go again.

"Nice breathing space, well kept in the middle of town."
Not really a tourist attraction if you arent already in the area but a much appreciated and needed break from the bustle and buildings all around it. It's a very charming park with lots of seating. Often very busy during the lunchtime hours. Worth a walk around for sure.
"I enjoy coming here since the renovations. No so quiet in the heart of downtown yet pleasant to be in. Nice place to bring your lunch and take a break from office life. You can meditate, do yoga, group exercises, people watch, eat from food trucks and contemplate life :)"

Wonderful little park to sit and people watch. Kept clean and looks wonderful in the winter with the slow and christmas lights.

Beautiful area to walk around anytime of the year. Historic buildings and beautiful architecture.
Awesome place/park to visit in Summers!!

Amazing place
Lovely park with iconic historical monument as the centerpiece. Great shortcut between the major streets in the area and lined with shopping and restaurants all around.
"Great place to chill,mix of modern and old"
"Just sit back and relax for a while. Squirrels, pigeons and sometimes seagulls going around like no one's there. Enjoy the scenery. There are not many places like this in downtown."

Nice place in the middle of downtown
Downtown Montreal
"The Sunlife building is particularly beautiful, lots of places to sit for lunch. The only downside to this park is that it's usually very busy with people buzzing through, pigeons everywhere and the regular Montreal smokers throwing their butts everywhere."
I wouldn't go here looking for silence because there is a lot of noise from cars and construction. But it's nice to go and sit under a tree and read a book or have a picnic during the summer.
"Beautiful Park. Unfortunately, it's between some very busy streets. Great place to workout outdoors: benches, ateps, stairs, grass."
Could spend hours around this area
Lovely area in the center of down town area
"Good place to have a pleasant evening during summer. The lawn and the benches, The statues and the buildings around it looks cools"
"Great spot to rip a blunt, but be on the lookout for the 5-0. They patrol on bikes frequently."

Favorite park downtown. Especially the rustic kiosk that sells coffee and ice cream.
Good place to see and rest

"It's a nice place to chill out , lunch and people watching."

Beautiful tribute to my mom
Nice quite place. 1 of the quiet spots of Nuns Island.
Good place to spend some time and do meditation.
Small and quiet with a beautiful view of the St Lawrence River
"Its okay, small, some space to see water."
"Not much there, just a short path and a couple benches and picnic tables. View of river is obstructed by trees and growth. Not much for kids"
"Nice to outside, frech air"
Very large and equiped..
"Parc des Faubourgs is a very popular place, especially on Sundays and holidays. Families and friends gather for picnics and outdoor parties. It can get crowded and very noisy. The source of the noise isn't limited to park revelers. The park ‚Ä¶"
Popular in the neighborhood. Has kids play structures and a water spray.
"Perfect place for that or just to hangout, there is a structure for the kids and a fountain as well in summer. The place is quite big and there will be some nice events sometimes."
A real nice Parc to pass the afternoon away
"Nice park! Perfect for a picnic or spending an afternoon calmly. However, there is no much else to do and it being divided makes it difficult to go around."
MONTREAL IS AMAZING WITH ITS GREEN SPACES THANKS SO MUCH
"If you want a place to relax this summer, you can go to this park. It is big and beautiful. You can bring your kids, pet or girlfriend. The landscape of this park is also beautiful. To walk or to run, this location is great. Go there and don't forget to take your video or photography camera. The next fall is a good time to go because of all the trees this park have. Enjoy."
Been here for a few events and its a perfect place for that or juste to hangout
"Excellent place for take the Sun, super spacious. Kids can have fun in the park."
Great clean park
Big park. Perfect to let kids roam free
"I went to this park to see free shows presented during the Pride week in Montreal. It's a great space in that there's lots of room to walk around, places to sit down, port-a-potties are installed for events, there's fountains that add ambiance, and enough room for 2 large stages. This year, however, there was just one main stage, and a large tent for DJ music which also served as protection from the elements. My only complaint with this park is that it's not near any metro stop, although there are bus routes that pass by. Most times I just walked there from the village area, which takes 15-20 minutes, depending on your walking speed. The best feature of this park is its capacity to hold large crowds with controlled access, as the park is surrounded by fencing, with the main entry point being on Ontario St. I think there are other points of entry available for those working at the events."
"Not the best place to bring toddlers or small children, as people bring their unleashed dogs here despite the signs telling them not to, and there are always cyclists zooming through the pedestrian paths. Also it's well maintained but fighting the cigarette butts is a losing battle. Go to the park a block away if you have children who might innocently wander into danger."
Great little park! I really enjoy it for some sun bathing or a picnic.
"Public wifi, beautiful fountain and clean porta potty. Nice place for a break."
"Easy access, an outdoor place where you can walk to the Latin Quarter on a pleasant tour."
Had a wonderful time here for Fiert√© 2019. The Ciara concert was especially awesome. I hope to spend more time here next year! Thanks Montr√©al!
"Nice open space for a game of frisbee. The sun is directly in your eyes if you're facing westwards during a game in the evening, so make sure you pick the east facing side if you want the advantage."
I was there for the gay festival. Nice park located   in the city centre.
"Really nice park to walk your dog, play outdoors or to spend some lovely time with your child."
"Lots of space to sun tan, read a book, picnic, plenty of room for everyone. Lots of playground equipment and a splash pad for the kids. Well maintained. One of the more relaxing places in Ville Marie."
"At pride they only had 4 atm's in side the park and only 3 of them where working.ot was cash bars only and the atm's where not even the sponsored Banks ATMs.
They should have had machines at every single bar that you can pay with your credit card or debit card."
Great place to attend events during pride month
It's great place. I was there because of Nelly Furtado's concert. Super!!!
Perfect space for Montreal Pride events. Safe and open space. Suitable for large outdoor concerts.
Nice grass lol
Great park to go to during Pride. They had many Ru Paul Drag Race contestants peform as well as Todrick Hall. Very taken care of.  Never been here other than for pride though. They have some great concerts here too.
Awesome place to go for a walk and sometimes there's shows like in pride week that are really awesome .
Large open space. Great for outdoor concerts and festivals.
Nice park for big events
"Wonderful area and is also used for gay pride
Great spot"
"This was the second year that Gay Pride Montreal/Fiert√© Montr√©al was held at Parc des Faubourgs and they made some minor but important improvements, most notably moving the mainstage to the far end of the park, freeing up access. Great Space. Great Gay Pride Montreal/Fiert√© Montr√©al  2018."
Great open space for frisby!
Like any other park. It has two playgrounds (I think for two and five years old) and free Wi-Fi. Some times is dirty because homeless leave their garbage around.
Really great job transforming an area that was the butt of many jokes into a very nice green space. Too bad that it'll likely become a refuge for the homeless in Montreal.
Wow what a large park. A bit of a walk from Metro Papineau but worth the walk!! So glad they moved Montreal Pride to this park.
Nice and beautiful park. Clean and well maintained
Cozy and calm parc near the gay village. Hosts amazing events during festivities such as the 30 years mado show and the giant pride dance on august 20th. Definitly recommended during those periods. clean park.
Park with several activities. Good to chill
"It is a relax park, where you can have access to lot of activity. The only thing that I can say it is not really cool, it is the basketball court when itis raining. It becomes very slippery."
"5 stars for fierte, otherwise probably a boring park"
Small but friendly park
Awesome place to go for a walk.
Beautiful place!
Fabulous gay drag show!!
Beautiful park for children and for rest
Hosted pride montreal 2019 what a party !!
Grass was dead so all that was left was dirt and everyone was kicking it up whenever they walked. Thank God I wasn't wearing white.

"Great park for the kids to enjoy a day out. There are different games and 2 differents parks, a big field, some pic nic tables and the information center is nearby wich is ideal as there have the lavatory and they also selling ice cream. Ask for the activity program for summer as there are a loads of interesting activities who are taking place in front off the information center."
Great place to hang out for all family members.
"Great green space,  very family friendly"
This is a beautiful relaxing place
Total dump avoid at all cost.

A beautiful oasis in the city.
"Excellent! *This Park* is ""mos def"" the type of outdoors facility that I would invite *ELITE ATHLETES* -- in order to help the neighborhood expand its horizon, its potential.

Note : by the term *ELITE*, I mean professional circuits *ballers* -- such as my friend LeBron James (23) -- !!!"
Lots of walking space and green !
Nice big park with surprising exercise module.
Great park for almost any activity üëè üëç
Loved it
Excellent park to exercise or relax. It is perfect to do jogging laps. It even has an area with outdoor machines. The view is fantastic from the top/center of the park.
"Went for winter activities.
Like the sledding area though I'm against the metal picket fence along the sides.
It's a bit unnerving seeing your child lose control and veer into it.
Well kept outdoor rink.
Both are lit up at night.
Seems like a good place for cross country."
Can't wait to explore it more often
Nice but cold weather
Beautiful park
Crazy park but just didn't like the double rims
Large clean park.  Many modules for kids to play in.
Nice park and there is fenced to avoid children to go through
"Great for training, Tennis courts lots of trees kept clean"
"It's a beautiful park but there is always trash and things such as used condoms and beer bottles on the ground. Sometimes broken glass as well. Generally safe for kids, aside for the hazardous items I've mentioned."
"Vaste green space to run, walk or play!
It has a playground for kids and basketball courts ss well! A very nice park in st l√©onard!!"
Installations we'll maintained and beautiful park
Cool place for a little walk. Outdoor Gym.
"Beautiful park, a lot of space to play with children, there is a nice public gym."
Fun park with beautiful landscaping and the exercise machines are a nice touch. Although for the scale of the park the paly area seems a little small
Any park that doesnt allow dogs isnt worth it imo.
Clean and large place. Interesting for kids.

"A little, beautiful, peaceful park with a stunning view of the old port, the downtown and the Jacques Cartier bridge. A bit to hard to get to on foot, but it's a nice walk when coming from the old Montreal/Port. The area has a few dedicated spots for BBQing."
"**PARKING CLOSED UNTIL DECEMBER 2021** YOU CAN STILL ACCESS THE PARK WALKING OR BIKING.... Great park about 15 minutes away from downtown Montr√©al offering: free parking, benches for picnic & and barbeque, public transit, public toilets. Beautiful view from the other side of old Montr√©al."
Best point to have view of Montreal
My favorite park with downtown view and parking is free.
"Located near Parc Cite du Havre near the casino off the island of montreal. It‚Äôs a great spot to see the montreal downtown skyline, catch the sunset or the fireworks. There is splenty of space for picnics, BBQ, or to just chill by the water. There is a free parking lot available but it gets full."
"Very nice park, usually not very busy and good for fishing and barbecues"
"Great views. Ride your bicycle, go fishing, have a picnic."
I worked nearby my patient is 94 years old and we love  to have a walk and looking for nice view
"No car access due to construction work (As of April 24,2021). Will have to park on street and walk to the park (approx. 300m to the entrance)."
Great place for a walk and watch nature. The park has many bicycle roads and you have a great view of the old port as well. Good for picture taking in summer. Some people even go fishing there!
"Great park to walk, hike, bike and do a picnic. The view of Montreal is amazing. The place is clean and well maintained. And the parking is free."
"Very relaxing hidden place in the old port
Spectacular view. Extremely recommended!!!"
"Nice place to enjoy a picnic with BBQ with a nice view to the old port! You can get there by bike since the bike path get through it! All services there, bathroom, etc, bin for garbage and even another one for BBQ leftover charcoal :)üòé"
"Oh of the best secret places in Montreal, journey to the tip of the island and you‚Äôll make a great place to enjoy fireworks, water and sunsets.

Processing stations to come to barbeque with your friends or even I like to spend some romantic time and take some beautiful photos."
Love this park - excellent view of Montreal and out of the way enough to feel a sense of calm serenity compared to the more populated parks in the city. A vast and great place to watch the sunset or exercise. Appeals to tourists and locals alike.
"Parking lot is a bit sketchy, but otherwise great park. And the view, oh the view!"
Nice little parc for spending some time with family. Lots of people come here for fishing so will be a bit crowded. You can do grill and have a small picnic. Good views of old Montreal port and the colorful bridge.
"Always quiet and beautiful! Perfect view of Montreal skyline..

Picture credits: varun Jagannathan"
"Very beautiful and enjoying place you can BBQ with charcoal, and propane Grills are available too. Amazing downtown view along river side."
"First time, just discovered this beautiful city parc. Parking is free! It seems that fishing is very popular here. Bike path. BBQ is allowed. But don't forget to cleanup at the end."
"Very good place to chill, fish or even party."
Just love this little park particularly in the summer but I discovered yesterday that it is also attractive in the winter even if a bit desolate.
It's a really great quiet park for photographing the city at night. Four stars since the facilities are closed in winter. And I had to walk 30 mins along a highway to get here from the metro.
"Great park, plenty of fresh air.
Beautiful view to the downtown and to the Old Port.
Not many tables in there for BBQ, bike path alongside to walking path."
Very nice park and Beautiful sunset spot‚ÄºÔ∏è

Chill place. Great view on the city. Can bring small bbq and has charcoal disposal cans.
Beautiful Montr√©al view
"Beautiful scenery, park well maintained, washrooms available & clean. Picnic tables and BBQ spits available on spot."
A beautiful peaceful park
"The best park in Montr√©al in my opinion. You have a view to the old port and also a view to Parc Jean-Drapeau, also a view to La Ronde"
The complex seems comfy with all those balconies and large windows but I hope they paint the walls.
"Love the park, and Fantastic place for family fun
And for fishing üé£ too"
Lovely park where you can fish with free parking space available
Lovely small park tucked away in Montreal near parc Jean drapeau
I meet two people's working there best people

And why are you NOT cycling around the area? We have awesome cycling in Montreal."

Beautiful  seneary."
What else you want from a park? So so beautiful
Beautiful park with great views of the city at sunset.
"Love the park. Not too overcrowded. Can bbq with you own grill. Plenty of tables trash bins and coal disposal bins.

There's some construction at the entrance but should be no hindrance ... the park is open, the entrance is on the left of the construction.

Nice bike lane excellent view and ambience."
"Awsome park with awful parking space, there is high chance that your car gets a scratch there."
"very nice views of the water and the city, word of advice: don't fall in the water
bring your bqq here during the summer with your family
you can fish for walleye in the spring, catfish and sturgeon in the summer, for advanced fishermen (that can't afford a boat)"
"Really nice place! Has a great view, actual bathroom, tables, used charcoal disposal. It was really clean, the clerk even gave us a ride and brought all our cooking equipment on his vehicle."
"Love this place. Calm and not many people. Good for a picnic or BBQ or just for a walk in appreciating the view on Montreal. When it is sunset moment, the Montreal view is amazing! I hope my feedback doesn't bring too much people at this place because it is a very calm and relaxing place in the city."
"Beautiful, but it is not a friendly Parc."
"Full of marijuana smokers at night, no clean air."
Good place to spend an evening..
They have grills on site now so feel free to juat bring your charcoal and bbq! Great scenic spot. With parking and bathrooms.
A remarably often quiet place to chill and get the best view of the Old Port.
A great place to chill.
Beautiful park all time
Great views of the city and river.
"great view, barbeque is allowed"
Cool
"Great park with amazing views of downtown Montreal. Lots of spots for picnic. It's accessible by bicycle from the Old Port, exclusively by a safe bike path.
There is a little beach and a promenade but the main feature is the view - you are surrounded on both sides by the mighty St Laurent river.
For cars, there is a parking lot."
"One of the best views of Montreal, difficult to access without a car but very easy to find on-site parking."
Really nice and intimate parc with a good view over the old port
"Such a great little park to walk through for some fresh air and a different perspective on the city. Whenever I've been, there has never been more than a handful of people either walking or fishing from the northern point. Very relaxing and peaceful. You can still feel the positive vibes from the parks creation for Expo67 :)"
Very nice at night
"I love this park offers great view of Montreal usually not too crowded convenient shaded parking and well accessible bike paths. Perfect place d
To walk your dog in winter as it is usually desert. Love it!"
Great place for fishing u can see the fish we catch on our Instagram @fishingcanadiens
Awesome hidden gem for outdoor walks. I saw ppl even fishing
Nice park on a peninsula within St. Laurent river. Popular place on sunny days so can be very crowded with families doing bbqs.
"Very quiet, peaceful."
I like this park can't wait for them to finish the construction tho
Very nice place
Don't go there
"A beautiful vantage point to view the fireworks or just to have a picnic. A few barbeques are scattered around the center and a clean bathroom at the entrance.
You can see Parc Jean Drapeau on one side and the old port on the other, although the best view is of both at the point.
It is a popular fishing spot where the odd meter long sturgeon can be spotted jumping out of the water resulting in a spectacle you don't see every day."
Great place to visit .. view is awesome and good for fishing also.
"Its a good place for picnic. You should come here AT NIGHT to watch the colorful view of the montreal downtown, the ferris wheel, the Champlain bridge and the Biosphere.

And on your way, you will pass by the Habitat 67 which is also worth a visit."
My favorite spot for fishing
Overall a great park to visit with friends/family! Only downfall is the parking is limited and very crowded
Very nice view

Nice place we took some photos it‚Äôs was my first time visiting the place it has incredible views
Excellent place for a barbecue. But the toilette was closed.
Cute little park that's kind of falling apart like the rest of Montreal. I think they stopped repairing things in 1967 after the Expo

Great place for outdoor events and family get together
"Try to go there on Tuesday evenings in the summer. Weekly, competitive cyclists of all ages and genders meet there for a competition where they circle around the park.
It's very satisfying and the atmosphere is great!"
"Nice park, space for small kids, bigger, tennis courts, basketball, sprinkles and pool. Bathrooms are an issue though when the tennis court one is closed...or the pool."

Nice place for kids to hang out.Barbeque place
Great park for families and kids
"Beautiful park, very good to spend time with kids."

Being a person who lives where they have the bike races every summer I apsalutly hate it and planing on moving due to the fact that I can't even park on my driveway on those days since It starts befor people finish work and ends after 8 try lugging a 8 13month old all your stuff and walk 2 maybe 3 blocks from home when you have a driveway
Now dogs are allowed there on leashes.

Nice park in front of Vanier college. It has a baseball field as well as a decently sized pool. There's parking available as well.
Very small but quiet park. Good to pass a few minutes or hours with plenty of foliage in summer and we'll maintained paths in winter.
Nice park but the chalet with the bathroom isn't open enough.
Went swimming during adult hour. Very peaceful.
A nice spot to get out of the city's rush.

Lot of homeless people
"There is a dog park, a park for small kids, older kids, a ping-pong table, a field to play soccer or football or whatever, and what I think is a shuffleboard area (might be something else).

It's nice."
"My only complaint is that this winter, 2021, due to covid they should've created 2 skating rinks like they have at MacDonald park. This winter a lot more ppl are using the rink compared to other years and since we're to respect social distancing it's kinda hard with even only 10 ppl skating (no one wearing a mask)."
Amazing park to walk the dog.  path in and around the park. They have a dog park. Plenty squirrels. Public restroom is open.pretty clean from what I saw.
Quiet park with some nice greenery
Great place with awesome dog run and an ice hockey rink
"Nice park, fun for kids. Definitely needs more upkeep by the city though.ove that Several citizens took it upon themselves to tidy up and decorate some of the play areas ti make it more inviting"
I love to go ther and watch the squirrels
"The ground games were all fixed (by a lovely lady and some help from the city). Croquet, Shuffle board, iron throwing(fer a cheval) and even books are coming. That, plus the nice splash pad/pataugeoire and nice young kid(0-5) games and older kid 5-12 jungle gym. It has it all."
Very nice family friendly park. Great play area for kids with water fountain and pool . Good to spend your day with picnic here.
Very enjoyable to eat a meal  - watch out for squirrels trying to steal your food üòÅ

Yesterday was a beautiful day to sit on a bench under a big tree while enjoying some ice-cream from Calem üòâ
Wild benches! I have long legs and my feet dangle. In this one bench in particular my feet are 10 inches off the ground. Really amazing. Also has dog park and mysterious building from the 60s in the middle. Good times.
"Nice park located on Sherbrooke with a little of everything for all ages. Two big soccer field areas, dog park, kids park with slides and a water area. Tons of benches and tables for having a nice picnic lunch or just relaxing under a shade tree. Great times to had during the summer months here. Even close to NDG's best ice cream spot."
love it!
Wonderful park!
Peaceful
"Kids love the wading pool, it has made my water hating toddler much more comfortable with swimming. Great playground and dog park too."
Nice and beautiful
I had a good time with my dog.
This park is right next to my house it is huge has to soccer fields a small pool for children a small park for children there's a place to play ping pong lots of room to lay around a dog park it is absolutely beautiful
Beautiful place to sit and relax
Love to sit hear after ice cream and just relax after a long day!
It has soccer fields that are being used by NDG soccer. You can register your kids at ndg soccer in March/April for playing and practicing soccer. Also there is a nice playground and water play area. A table tennis is also there. A building for volleyball play is also in the park. You can register at NDG Sport Centre in Benny to play in there whole year around.
"With Notre-Dame-de-Grace having been destroyed by a cloudburst a few years back, the green cathedral colonnade in Trenholme Park is now the most beautiful one remaining in NDG.

Trenholme has the best dog park in the city, in the corner closest to Caf√©92. There's a useful Bixi stand along Park Row West.

There's a water fountain near the bus stop along Sherbrooke O.

Two soccer fields, two playgrounds, a splashpad and a gymnasium that often doubles as a polling station.

In the winter, there's an outdoor ice rink."
Good laid back vibe!
"Wonderful dog area, dogs very sociable, as are their owners. Really satisfying to see dogs play and frolic off leash. Great way to spend an hour or two."
Great park
"Nice place to sit and relax,peaceful and quiet."
Nice shaded green space. Water park for the kids. Good playing field for soccer.
Great splash pad
Beware of the nasty smoke from the nearby factory. Dark grey smoke covered the entire playground.
"Mostly use the dog park, but it's nice. Lot of running space for my dog. Friendly people hangs out there"
"Dog park, soccer fields, kids park and nice splash pad for kids"
Average park... The chalet needs some love
"Large park with two playgrounds, a brand new splash pool, a gymnasium building, baseball and soccer fields, dog park, and tons of green space. Would be nice to see the gym cleaned up so there are public bathrooms, and something done with the old shuffleboard court."
"It's a nice park, there's a dog run as well and numerous benches."
It is a decent park with a ot of open space. The playground is s bit dated but there is a new splash pad there now.
"Safe park. Big Park! Great for sports, or hanging out!"
"The park is very poorly maintained by the city, but it isnt a bad park. Tree branches hang quite low on many of the trees, and those that are cut or have broken are left on the ground. It has a small dog park section which is essentially just a fenced in dirt patch. The pathway on the Sherbrooke side of the park is always riddled with cigarette butts. On the plus side, it has 2 well maintained soccer fields on the maisonneuve side of the park, a wide-open grassy patch for sunning, yoga, or frisbee, and a small play area with slides and water games for kids. And for any animal lovers, there are always plenty of squirrels around to feed."
Great for dogs as it has a fenced dog park area.
Nice park with children playground and also closed area for dogs within the park.
I love it but it needs to be cleaned routinely.
Nice place for falilies and kids
Awesome for special needs children
Mini gym great for kids

"Favorite park but I'm biased as I used to hang out here as a teen.

It's got a large dog park and tables to hang out at plus now I saw they had an outdoor ping pong table."
One of the many lovely parks in NDG
"It's alright, a lot of annoying dog people."

A good place to walk or jog. Play team sports and do zumba. Picnic and barbecue ground. Lots of trees so you can breath fresh air.
"Large open space, water park, fun modules for the kids, lots of shaded areas for picnics. If you must use the washroom, hold your breath and get in and out as fast as possible."
It's a cool park very family oriented and one of the best spot to have a BBQ but go early to secure your spot
"Love this place. I bought my new apartment near this park just because of this park. Little are of woods is best for photography. Kids love this place. It has water play platform.
Newly built basketball court.
Many swings and slides for kids.
Football ground."

To be honest Montreal has better parks. Park has a nice football ground and enough tracks for jogging and cycling
Great in every season... Now during snow times there is an ice rink also and kids can play on the slides as well.
"Great place amidst the city life. All facilities such as football field, volleyball court, basketball court, kids play area, water park, and walking path really well structured."
"Park has a small forest, some shaded areas, benches, picnic tables, water fountains, and toilets. Only thing missing is WiFi and a microwave!"
Its a nice park for an evening stroll. It also has a small children's park at one corner.
One of my favorite parks to picnic. In the winter there's a small ice skating rank and kids can slide on the hill.
Place and unity in Mckenzie all day every #tchillspot
Good place to barbecue in CDN area.
"The new and improved basketball court at Park Makenzie King. The court has not yet been officially opened. August 25, 2020."
"It's a nice small park, there is a cool structure somepne made around one of the trees, the only setback is that I wish it was a bit bigger, you can hear cars driving sometimes."
Kabab.... Lots of kabab....
Nice place for for the activities and for dining as well
Good place for children and parents to hangout.
Nice place for hangouts.
Nice big park... has splash pad and 2 playgrounds for kids... may get pretty crowded and noisy on the weekends
Nice place for any sports activity. Gets busy in the evenings. Sidewalks surrounding this block make 0.99km which makes it ideal for running while keeping track of distance.

Clean and the place is good for walking and jogging
Nice place to release your self!

Nice and safety park to enjoy with children in winter time
"This place is great! Things to do here: read, picnics, play football, frisbee.

Pet friendly."
Parc is good. People using it are not. The parc is disgustingly full of plastic on the ground and people who do their barbecues on the weekend leave trash and food ON THE FLOOR. No dog park although it is a necessity in this neighborhood.
Nice little park for the kids to play in has about everything for every age
"Very nice park but gets overcrowded easily by big families. If you want to just sit and relax under the sun, get ready for the noise coming from ppl barbequing and partying in there... which isnt unsual ‚ò∫"
"Usually packed. But because it's big enough, its okay to be around."
"Great place to mingle, to play soccer-volleyball, and. To to take you kids"
Great park to have either of a peaceful time or fun with friends and family
Spring is here
Very spacious and green with lots of places to sit in the shade or sun
"I never go there again.
there is a lot of garbage around and no one is cleaning up after himself."
Not bad for a public and family park..
Nice place to roam around.. love this place
Needs better trash can options
The west part lawn of the park is soaked with water on rainy day.
Great to have fence for water field and infants field.
"Very nice park with a lot of field to play with friends and family, soccer, volleyball, freesbie, etc. This place is full of good people and friendly smile. Love going there in summer just sit and relax and watch many different cultural communities as one."
Really nice park with both sand and woodchip ground. Two separate area one for toddlers and another for older children.
Great family park. Fun parties practically every weekend
The park was a nice place and this  weekend of June 29 there was a event going on so it was interesting
Excellent location for realizations
Huge playground and lots of activities.

Renovation of the basketball court is highly recommended
"wow, Best destination for all age groups"
"Awesome park, place for sporting activities, popular for picnics and events. Connected along the bike trail."
It‚Äôs a park but there‚Äôs no parking for cars. Not a good spot if you have a car and you are just visiting.
Great place to BBQ and spend quality time with the family. The playground is pretty clean
Nice park to hang out during spring and summer.
Nice place but noisy because ot the busy street nearby
Grew up having bbqs in this park. Very lively. Always happenings in the summer.

"Love the park. City made a beach last year although it's tiny. I was expecting much wider beach. Nice bike path, almost no place for runners."
V‚ô° cute park
I'm going to the this park everyday it's nice place.
This I believe is partly including the site of the new Verdun Beach just behind the Verdun Auditorium which is under hugh renovations. Its located along the bikepath from lasalle to Vetdun and further to old Montreal.
It's best place to relax with nature... sitting on the bench looking at the water with a 80%volume music made me lost in this world for an hour‚ô•Ô∏è
"Beautiful sunrises, sunsets by the St-Laurent river.  Cyclable path, skate park, games for kids and adults, swimming pools, tennis courts, baseball courts,  fishing and soon a beach.  What more can you ask.  I love Verdun and the south west by the river."
"Nice park, decent tennis courts, bike path begins and ends rather abruptly in places though."
Needs a dog park.
Love this parc
"Perfect for biking, running, strolling or enjoying the view of the water. The view is great in the summer!"

"I grew up here so of course I love it but during winter they 2 skating rings - 1 for hockey and 1 just to skate, there are every main sport fields there‚Äôs some items you could use to workout and even a pool In the winter whoever owns this park is a legend"
Very good place for entire family!
"My god. The traffic was insane. 30 minutes stop and go up the hill, then a Battle Royale for a parking spot. Then fighting crowds of people to get a good view of the city while everyone pushes you to get a good instagram photo.

Great view though. Then a 45 minute stop and go drive down . Extra challenge. I had three Russian speaking women in the car chatting non stop giving me a crazy headache and I had to act like all was cool.  Over an hour in traffic for a good view and a headache. Don't go Thanksgiving weekend."
"Awesome place for sports there‚Äôs 2 tennis court, 2 baseball courts, swimming pool, playground!!"
Great 400m loop rink

"lovely little park to walk through and take the dog too!!!grass is green, trees are healthy, backyards from neighbouring houses are mostly fenced in and there are benches and a spot with free dog bags for little accidents!!!"
Beautiful! Worth a visitüòÄ
Very nice place to read peacefully
"Nice little park, usually quite"
Quiet lil space. Right off the path.
Best park around here
Great park
"You can walk your dog on leash, big green space"
Hidden little park. The bike path goes right through it.
Went to the parc with my girlfriend and son to try out our new 4drc 4k drone
It's a clean nice open park
Great for all the family
Is it allowed to make a small barbecue in the park?
No water fountain working!
üëçüëç
I loved it.  I'm a nature kinda guy.
"Have gone here for years to celebrate family birthdays. This year there has been a severe decrease in park cleanliness, specifically overflowing garbage bins and bathrooms out of service, porta-potties full to the max and not clean. There is also a severe red ant infestation (beyond the normal amount of ants you expect in a park). Parking has historically been inadequate as well. It's a shame since the park is spacious with lots of shade and water views. It needs to be managed better."
Nice large park with a beautiful view by the water. Not crowded and lots of space for kids. Many Tables and benches.  Pet friendly as long as they are on a leach.
Park along the St Lawrence river with large green spaces to run around or BBQ. Bike path from Notre-Dame street crosses through the park.  Many areas to sit by the river. There is an open air stage with shows as well as public bathrooms and an ice-cream place
"Very beautiful park beside the water. Not too crowded, a lot of space. The park is long so good for walks"
"Enjoyed walking this waterfront promenade from this center point of a long stretch along the St- Lawrence.
Bonus: there's a new structure that not only offers an observation deck...it also offers a picnic area set up on two leveled deck.  Plenty of parking in the area as well as a public washroom within the next adjacent park."
Peace and quiet. There were other people but everything was chill and respectful.
This is a gem of a park in the east end of Montreal. One of the most beautiful park in Montreal.
"One the biggest parcs in Montreal, you will always find a spot there no matter how crowd is it!"
"This is a really nice and quiet park where you can go and use the bike path, there is also a nice view of the port and the south shore islands from there, I saw many ppl fishing üé£ overall the park was clean."
Parks automatically get 5 stars from me
"Bring your family, pets, chillax for all!"
It's a huge parc. I love it.
Great park for a long walk next to the river. It has enough space so people keep their distances. Parking is easy along the street.
Very beautiful park. Very big and has everything needed for hours of pleasure.
Very huge and peaceful place to visit and best for picnic and there is best ice cream shop overthere
Calm and picturesque!
Great quiet park especially to go and see the ships.
A lovely parc along the river. You can view industrial boats. Go fishing. Or just relax on the rocks by the shores. Very nice.
"A nice, quiet park for a chill weekday morning. It feels nice to see the river. Shame, Montreal, for that sad urban planning cutting the river off pretty much everywhere... We need more shores like this one!"
"Beautiful spot, ideal for walking or biking, picnics. And lots of spots right on the water."
"Park is huge, small beach but very enjoyable. I wouldn't swim there but for my feet it gets the job done! There is also a paddling pool for toddlers. Overall it's a nice spot in Montreal for a picnic if you don't want to go too far!"
"Good mixture today of river, snow and sun. Easy and enjoyable walking."
It was a good walk. I flew my drone for the first time here. It was quite and not much people so. I have time to have a peaceful moment. The sound of water and breezey summer...
"WOW, nice park&view"
"Very beautiful, nice long walk"
"This place is awesome by the water with table, was perfect to unwind and celebrate the beautiful weather"
"This is a huge park with many sitting areas and different activities for the entire family. we were looking for an area that we can access the water closer to the East end instead of always going to the West Island and this is the only place we found.

The view was not that great. and there are industrial ports on both sides so no matter where you are sitting and you look to the left or the right you'll always see something very huge mechanical and industrial.

There was only one main place to access the water.

other than the water situation the park itself deserves more than three stars but I am giving this rating based on my experience and my desire to get to the water."
Great water scene and great spaces. Worth the visit!
"Great park to have a picnic, BBQ, watch the sunset, take a walk or just hanging with friends"
"Peaceful, beautiful and nice view"
Good for take a walk. or bicycles. not much shade at some part.
Best park everrrrr
Easy to walk and nice views of the Saint-Laurence rivers
"Beautiful place, clean but bathrooms are far, still we had a blast!!!"
"Great place to bike, walk, picnic... Just take in the sun and go on the shore of the St-Laurence River."
Top notch...
For walks is the best
"Perfect for walks, jogs, bicycling and river side relaxing."
Very interesting place
Beautiful and tidy natural retreat close to the city
"Beautiful park along the river and much longer than what is suggested on Google Maps. The presence of container terminals on each side of the park means that one will see many container ships passing along the river, which makes for a different vibe from the waterfront parks in the West Island or along the Lachine rapids. The ferry to Ile Charron is relatively cheap (under $9 round trip) and offers a pleasant 15-minute ride each way to one of the National Parks (S√âPAQ), a pleasant getaway from the city that offers many hiking, biking, water sports opportunities."
Nice park for friends and family to gather right on the river.
"Super.. Very nice view
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
A nice walk along the river

Tr√®s belle plage et place.
üëç
Good place play cricket
Beautiful place to go and enjoy Montreal's heart
Playground with facilities for football and other games. Lighting system is also good for night games. Place for fun and play for children.
Great soccer fields!!!
Thai is a great park to go play frisbee in and to just talk to friends and family. Expecially now because there is a lot of space so it is easy to social distance.
Rutherford Park is a soccer field- a very nice one too with a sort of path around it for say jogging. Parking is not so bad on University above Sherbrooke and only 2-3 minute walk
Niche parc to come to at night if you want a great view.
Best field and best view of downtown Montreal.
"Good for workout, jogging and walking"
"Good place to do recreational activities. Good to go for a jog, with your dog, grilling and many other things."
Nice crowd. Friendly people. Great ground
Great view of the city and a nice place to exercise
"The field. The only problem is right now (late June, 2020) they do not turn on the lights so you can't see the ball after sunset."
"Beautiful park with a great backdrop and perfect sports surfaces. It has a full soccer pitch,  half field nets and lines. There are many other surfaces as well: including a volleyball net and green spaces.

But! No accessible parking. A very big ossue for visiting sports teams.

Walking 3-6 blocks with a large ball bag and first aid kit and other covid-19 PPE is very cumbersome."
good to run or enjoy sports.
Clean park with a nice view
Great soccer field
Beautiful place!
"Beautiful green space near McGill University. From here, you can follow the uphill walk paths leading to the top of Mont Royal."
Awesome place with soccer ground
No bathrooms
It's really boring... it doesn't even have a soccer field
Amazing park with very modern equipment- I really like the bouncy floor for workouts - easy to find Parking
"There is only one bathroom and it's only open from 1pm to 5pm which is not at all enough, this amenity needs to be improved by the city.

Upside is there are plenty of sport installations and greenery."
Clean & spacious family park.
"Very good place for a nice walk, jog and other exercise. Nice for families with small kids."
"Clean and tidy place to spend good time with family and friends ... There is a basketball, tennis and basball yard ....awsome üòäüòä"
nice big park
Love this place 3 minutes  from my house peaceful love the table tennis spot
"I go regularly to participate in a big band that rehearses in the ""chalet"" located within the park. It's a well equipped, well maintained building that serves our purposes well."
Awesome workout space if you like calisthenics
Nice park
"There is an outside gym, basketball court"
üíöüíØ
"Is not a large parc, it has a water fountain in good weather, definitely in summer, and looking over the fountain is a statue of Jacques Cartier. This parc borders St-Antoine on north, on east is rue Laporte, on west is rue Agnes, one street west of Imperial Tobacco on rue St-Antoine, and rue Irene is Parc St-Henri. Some spaced out parc benches, further south is rue St-Jacques, runs west from the glen to rue Atwater oneway going east, to Atwater Market, and this Parc is approx. 7-9 streets West of rue Atwater and rue St-Antoine. There has been much renovations, and Condo development is going forward well into the future. This Parc hss been there for well over 100 years plus possibly. Go site explore snd walk around St-Henri Parc, famous people have grown up here. Famous names to name a fewI I know of, like Oscar Peterson and family, Rufus Rockhead, coach Pat Burns and family, and many more Celebs. St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church is still there on rue Couvent and St-Antoine, the English. Catholic boys and girls shool has since been replaced with a French school now. Go take a tour, please. St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church now is a Salle de R√©ception, renovations complete, opens today thurs, june 12-19, beautiful d√©cor all white with beautiful chandeliers hanging from the high old church ceiling. Valet parking, what a change and note of memories growing up here."
"Pretty nice one, if a little small and lacking in grassy seating. Some dudes next to us had a tiny barbecue going and made the whole park smoky and smell like charcoal and meat - was pretty cool"
The gentrified Shenreez (St Henri) most popular park
Nice place to visit
"Nice parc to chill in in Saint Henri. With its few picnic table, it's also a nice place for a little gathering with friends."
The park is improving in atmosphere. Less trashy than before. But the statue must go ‚úäüèæ‚úäüèæ
I live right in front of this gorgeous little park. Summers nights with the fountain running are delightful
Large park with a beautiful fountain. The benches are comfortable. There is no facilities in this park but it's a quiet place to relax.
Quiet and peaceful.  Beautiful place to chill..and wiifii available too.
Nice park with a beautiful fountain and mature trees.  Ideal to take an afternoon break or a dog walk.
"Chill parc under tree canopy, with fountain"
"It is a really nice small park.
There is a nice old, lighted fountain in the middle of the park, which adds a really nice touch to it.
And the park is surrounded by old Montreal houses, which are really beautiful to look at.
Definitely a spot to sit and relax."
"This is a classic Montreal park, big trees, gravel paths and a nice fountain."
Pretty little. Smells mildly bad. Nicely organized. Charming statue.
This is a very pretty park Montreal style
"Very simple park, but still has everything you need to enjoy. Got park benchs, trees, grass and people going around with dogs. 10/10 would park again! Sometime less is more ‚ò∫"
"A nice parc with a fountain in its center dedicated to Jacques Cartier sent by Fran√ßois 1er in 1534. Big mature trees are ornamenting the area. A Bibi parking is located in the park. There are often a good breeze here ans sitting here is nice. The neighborhood is poor so you can expect some people with less money spending more than then they should in the part, but it‚Äôs not bothering."
This parc is a monument to selfishness of Montreal dog owners. You literally can‚Äôt make a single step without stomping into excrements
Dope parc but I hate the racisit statue
Lovely park for a talk with a friend. Beautifully fountain in the middle
"My favorite place near my home. Not too crowded, and well maintained."

Nice little bike path for learning on a glider. And a fun dinosaur on springs to ride.
Great playground for kids. Too many judgy moms think they own the place...
"Toddler bike path and two jungle gyms. Pretty well maintained, but the entry gate is a bit fiddly."
Lovely place to get out to.
Nice park for children
Not a lot of places to sit for adults great for kids though
Nice bike path.
Nice safe kids playground
A little park near the St-Lawrence river
"Nice and small Park.
I like going there for snow sliding in winters.
Less populated. This place is good for young kids."
Excellent and quit to enjoy with the nature
"Great place to hangout and for picnics. Small park with one part having a couple of benches (6-seater) on one side, an open lawn on the other. There's Trekfit open fitness center on the other side of the trail path. There are also couple of stones at the riverside if you just want to relax and enjoy the view.
On a sunny day, it makes a great place to hangout. So many things going on here. But on a not-so-good weather day, it's very quiet as well. But definitely to be visited."
"Beautiful park by Saint Lawrence river,  cool environment, eye touching views"
A great bit of nature in the city. Nice even in winter.
Very pretty with spacious paths and plenty of strategically placed benches
Great place for a picnic and other activities.
Great park for a family and to get away from a city. It is located on it's own island.
Amazing trees üå≥ üòç.  I love walking there the view is always beautiful and inspiring. Great for meditation.
It's one of the most beautiful places on Nuns Island
"It‚Äôs a nice place with lots of birds.

It‚Äôs where I do my stretching everyday and some days morning and night.

For those wishing to picnic please limit your garbage to a minimum and bring it back if the waste could attract animals. I am sure most people think about it but I‚Äôve noticed too many times that the üóë was full or overloaded."
beautiful place haven't been sense i was a kid so much changed yet somehow so familiar
Some things need to fix...
Great park with an outdoor gym and a fantastic view of the Saint-Laurence river.

The kids love this place. It's called the water parc. When the weather is very hot we go there
"Great little place to bring young children. In the hot days of summer, there are water games which are nice."
"Little but close to the water if you take the little path. The "" forest "" is small now. They built a lot on the ""Pointe Sud""."
Amazing river view. Nice place to go and just relax  enjoying the landscape scenario
"Great park for walking your dog, training or just chill out!"
"Nice and calm, good place for families for 2-3 hours picnic. Free parking is available."
Were very good
Cool

Nice place

Charming promenade along the riverside
Wow!
Great place for BBQ and biking.
... it's doesn't exist anymore...
It's near Parc Frederic Bach! There's a playground and a basketball court. There's also the bigger park nereby.
Nothing to do there. We organized the Run for the Cure event and we had enough space but nothing else to do.
huge parc! good for walking or riding bicycle or a little romantic trip. also great to play a full soccer game and there's also a basket ball court and children playgrounds. Not all areas are open yet though.
"2 playgrounds, basketball court, spacious."
Under construction
Cool
Nice
"Nice dog park! Big enough even for a big dog to run and play. Usually there are many visitors, so if you want to socialize your dog, it's a good place."
"Good park to relax, go for a walk with your or go with friends.
There are basketball courts, dog park, baseball fields, places to chill in the sun and shade."
Beaubien park is a nice but the dog park is not the best. The ground surface is not really nice.. all dirt. I prefer Parc Jarry.
Very nice üëç
"Large park with place for my dog to run. Place to park our car, easy access and near amenities."
"This park has a few activities to do. There is no soccer field nor swimming pool but there is however two baseball diamonds, two basketball courts, a tennis area, a dog park and a pool and playground for toddlers. Its situated near a Dairy Queen which is good too."
Love the dogs 4/5 of the time
Beautiful flowers all around the Parque Beaubuen
So many dogs all the time ! Enough places to sit and everyone is very nice :)
Great friendly family park
It was such a great night!
Ukrainian festival this weekend food music and more very nice park
"This park is not large, but it has all the essentials for both summer and winter - a playground for kids, a soccer field, a hill for sledding and a skating rink (including one for hockey), a chalet, tables and benches to sit and even small waterfalls. Ducks and ducklings are there in summer. Cosy and nice. Love it!"
"One of the larger and most popular parks in Outremont. A great place for kids of all ages with a well kept outdoor soccer field, a decent hill for sledding in the winter, or a simple stroll on a warm summer day."
Perfect for going out with your family on a sunny day or to take out your dogs
Nice Park for a family or just to bring your dog outside in the dog park.
"wonderful parc... only down side.. dogs are allowed, so it's dangerous within this aspect"
Really nice. Huge faux-grass soccer fields and fun kid playground. Great in the winter too.
"Its a nice park, its clean and the games are in a good state."
Super cool we made a film there.
A nice park to chill out with your friends
Nice park but not really a place to hang out.  Prefer to go west a bit and find a picnic table at Molson park if you are looking to relax under the trees.
"Has a nice dog park fenced in, two baseball fields, tennis, kids park. The baseball fields need work, the safety fences are old and dangerous to the players. Not sure why the city  has not done anything about it."
"Nice park where you can play tennis, basketball, baseball. There is a dog park, water fountains, and benches."
"Its a big enough park with a tennis court, a dog park, 2 play areas, I
1 for small kids and 1 for the big kids. There's also a kiddy pool in the summer and a skating ring in the winter and plenty of green space to walk or picnic etc."
"A beautiful little park, equally beautifully maintained. The waterfall is a great feature."
There is a great kids park for all ages..both the little ones and the big ones have a park of there own.

Nice park. Baseball and tennis fans will surely enjoy.
Ukrainian festival excellent. Park is clean and well kept
Nice patk ; play ground ; baseball field and tennis court
So peaceful and green. Love the fountain here also.
Nice dog park where you can drink beer in peace.
Nice little Park with a circular fountain where it's agreable to sit and read or just enjoy the big treesüå≤üå≥üå¥ around; this is in a posh part of the cityüåá
Not too many trees but it has great park and fountain for kids. Plus tennis courts and basketball

The smaller baseball field could stand a little (big !) work. So 1970... :O
"Great place to relax, play soccer or hockey."
"Beautiful park with a nice playground, soccer field and stream."
"Nice place, clean and lean."
It an open space for families with small kids... love the baseball field ‚ò∫

Lots and lots of squirrels.
We need mooooore  baseball fields
Excellent
"good little park. Brought my dog on a visit while in mtl. Located in a beautiful park, the dog section is fenced in with small gravel base with a water station and very friendly people and dogs."
pataugeoire s√©curitaire pour les enfants. equiper vous de cr√®me solaire et chapeaux. Il y a des bancs pour que les adultes puissent s'asseoir et surveiller les enfants mais peu de banc sous l'ombre.
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Nice tiny park with benches to sit on. Lovely trees in bloom during the spring.
"This is a five star park.
Reason is simple. It fulfills irs basic function as a park, providing a clean friendly and multidimensional  option to all users, no matter their age.
Kids can play in the playground, enjoying outdoor and nature. The park is huge, more than enough for all the kids in the neighborhood.
Youth can gather there to play a game , soccer or whatever that fit their mood.
Couples can take a walk or find a bench and chat.
For runners and joggers, there is a  1.5 km route or a 2 km route, whatever they want. Or combine them for a few round to make 5 km.
For students, the park is by the side of a library. It is convenient to do something else beside studying.
For a family, just go there. Free to choose whatever.
Cream on the icing, there is a beautiful lake."
"Best place in Saint Laurent.
Jogging, tennis, soccer, skateboarding, a small hike, a small party place....you name it!
They maintain it very well. Lots of school games done here. You can come with your kids sit around and they play, fly kite etc.
Come with your dog for walking. Overall good public place for gathering."
It's a great little park for a walk with your lady (or gentleman if you are a lady) in the evening or very early in the morning.
"An enchanting place for all.  I took a most enjoyable stroll admiring the lush green throughout the park.  The ducks, fish and turtles swam contently in their pond adding to the charm of this most scenic park.
Impeccably clean and suitable for all tastes.  The numerous athletic fields, indoor ice-rink, and jogging and cycling paths welcome the sporty type.  As for us romantics, a blanket under the rich foliage of one of the many trees is more than enough to reward any nature-lover."
Good park for kids üòú because there's zones reserved for a certain age so there's not other kids disturbing your childs
It's a wonderful place to do sports and enjoy nature
Love this skatepark   also lots of soccer fields
"Great place to be with friends and family.
Lots of open space for kids to play while maintaining social distancing."
Spacious enough for large outdoor activities ‚úå
This place is so peaceful specially near the pound. It feels cool near water and it's worth to visit if you don't like crowd. Then you should visit this parc.
Beautiful walk through the woods!
"Beautiful little oasis in the middle of residential, commercial and industrial area. Lots of wild life and remnants of a creek that used to drain the wetlands of the area. A library was built next to it a few years ago and looks out on it."
It's a park and you can have a picnic I think . There's a couple of people there normally and close to bus stop
"A nice piece of nature in the city. The only place to see some unique bird species, as well."
The track has been redone and isn't disgusting anymore. Large empty soccer fields to activities.
"Nice quiet place to go for a walk or jog, just not when it snows super slippery and the signs say no dogs but that doesn't help people from walking them n not cleaning up after them."
"A very large beautiful park full of amenities. Soccer fields, running track, tennis courts, plus beautiful paths for walking and running along pond with ducks and geese and a waterfall, or through forested wooded areas."
Hidden oasis in the heart of an industrial area
"I love this place, so quiet and amazing views"
Nice and calm place. Beautiful scene.
Beautiful landscape and lake. A little bit crowded.
"Beautiful place to walk around or take pictures, even for weddings"
"Perfect in every possible way, except that the toilets close at 6pm."
Nice track
Best park ever
"I really loved this park, because their is a lot  of space to play tennis, to walk around and to have pique-nique."
"The park is great. It is clean and big. You should definitely walk through the section found into Bois-Franc. Many birds and other wildlife spend their time in the pond making it a very calming escape. There is also another similar space at a 10 minute walk from there, deeper into Bois-Franc."
"I would have rated it a 5 but for the fact that there is no signage anywhere. The place is huge and has at least 13 soccer fields. Had there not been city employees to direct me, i'd still be looking for the correct field."
Beautiful park
Made snowman with my grandchildren.
Amazing walks with your first date
ML was very quite today and I loved that...üåû
Beautiful park.
Enjoyed the place
best free open running track!
Amazing landscaping and great neighborhood.  Perfect for younger families with kids. Plenty of outdoor activities for everyone.
I love the green space. Though I wish the city would spend capital on implementing turf soccer fields. In this climate it is difficult and expensive to properly maintain grass fields.
"Has everything tennis, soccer, running track, baseball. An athlete's dream place to go to."
Very beautiful park. In the pond you can find carp fish. Kids will love it. There is a well maintained path way around the pond.
Nice place to go for a quiet walk or a romantic walk and a nice big park for your kids to go play
A lovely walk near the airport hotels.  There is a thousand meter loop walk through nice woods with a small Creek and signs describing the flona. Don't miss the pond and fountain on the north separated from the woods. It's an easy 30 minute walk from the crown plaza and nearby hotels. Great place to kill a couple hours in an otherwise desolate industrial area.
"Spacious, varied and well kept"
"This park is pretty large compared to others near it. It has a swimming pool, a playground, a basketball terrain, a baseball terrain, as well as a football field. I'm found of sitting in the shadows of the trees in this park, I really like it!"
Very relaxing and nice view
Beautiful üòç
"Loads of soccer field, arena, sports complex and library are next to it. Although grass need a little treatment. There is also a nice little woods right beside it."
"Love this park, unfortunately ignorant people keep throwing their garbage after eating and feeding the birds and fish even if there's a clear sign not to do so!"
"Very good prices, good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in Europe.

Good quality stuff!

I would go there every time in the future for all their products as they are very good.

Every time I go there I take the special of the day which is good all time, winter and summer, especially in the eveningk when the parking is available."
Nice big park with lot‚Äôs of facilities and a dog park as well.
Nice park although not very many dogs go there it depends on the day. Lots of owners do not want pick up after their dog.
"Beautiful park in the heart of ville saint Laurent. Civic center with pool, tennis courts and other facilities. Library ."
Park is beautiful and excellent but the security gard is an idiot.
It's so nice but after sunset there is so many mustc
"This park is so large!!!  Soccer fields for different ages, a baseball field/pitch? Lots of light when it gets darker and friendly staff who set up fields and take them down."
Softball game. The field is nice and well taken care of but there was trash pretty much everywhere near the fields. The garbage was overflowing and people didn't seem to mind it.
It's calm and relaxing but there is sometimes a bad odour
Great park with lots of soccer fields as well as a track and field location. It's adjacent to a library and small nature reserve. It's quite clean with lots of parking and beautiful scenery
Nice trails to walk in and it's just a block away from my work!
"Still under development. Not a park to leave kids unsupervised, as it is rather exposed on all sides and close to two rat run streets. Gives good views of Vanier and nearby buildings. Nice place for sunset summer walks."
Very nice park. Always enjoy it when we have practice there or games. Parking is not always easy.

Lovely park. A forest in our neighborhood which our kids loved to go
A very relaxing place and it's perfect for kids...
This is the parc I went to every day to eat while I was in high school. I still go there multiple times a month to enjoy the scenery and take pictures. Go there when the weather allows you and take a walk on the path that surrounds the path and threw the forest.
This is an amazing park but it seriously needs more garbage bins.
"Great place to play soccer. Reserving a field is difficult, but try to reserve one if you can. You might be kicked out by someone with a reservation otherwise :("
Very good
"Great place for soccer, football and tennis. They also have a indoor sport center where you can play soccer, a swimming pool, basketball court, a weight training room."
Very good place to relax fie everyone
Clean beautiful well maintained. You can have a pleasant time if you don't mind the noise of the airplanes descending torwards the the nearby airport.
Ppl can be disrespectful at times

Lots of open area for kids to play and even a cute little place for picnics
Haven't seen the whole thing but the waterside is cool. For anything.
"Nice big park , with a big pond , skate park, several soccer field and a conditioned running track. It is also linked to the ""bois√©"" wich is a small wooded area , a little urban forest. Although, have good rain boots or shoes on rainy days, some parts of the ground on the park have bad water retention so there are small puddles on the grass that can get your shoes, socks wet."
So far so good till now . all is going well
Great place for sports and family activities
Nice park with many soccer fields and a large dog park. Dogs are unfortunately not allowed in the park itself.

Pierrefonds finest recreational and professional multi- complex sports facility located in central  Pierrefonds. It's a blessing to have a top notch facility like George Springate Park and we owe it all to our Mayor Dimitrios Beis. Keep up the great work!!
"Beautiful field with bleachers , track , water fountains and long jump area ."
"Nice park with basketball court, big field for games such as football or baseball and an area with traditional park things such as a slide and swings. But, there I snow water fountain, so don't spend too long here or make sure to bring your own water"

Used to take the girls there on a daily basis when they were little. Fun place to play with them. Now I walk the dog by the park.

It has 1 soccer and 1 football field. with renewed turf, think its astroturf and the football field is bordered with a newly great looking painted 6 lane track. It also has a baseball diamond, and tennis courts. Their is a kids playground on site. Its parking is on rue Rene Emard north of Pierrefonds blvd."
Nice public tennis courts. I remember coming here in 2006 with my first gf.
Beautifully renovated park! Good job!
"It's pretty small park, but we'll maintained, younger kids should find it good enough"
"Nice green park, lots of room to run and play.  Parking available at the wonderful flood rescue center PCHS.  Water fountains, if you look.  Has a lot of Canadian Geese that hang around, and gulls, so keep an eye out, because they dont scoop up afterwards.  Many rigs in a fenced in area for little kids, too.

dense cluttered and unkempt forest.
Nice little trail on the island
Super place. Recommended!

A great place for a walk
"Tranquility, expressed in nature."
Very nice to visit
Enjoy the walk
Nice and relaxing place
No dogs allowed.
I like their services very much. They are quite professional and hard-working. When ordering something online it allows me to track the whereabouts of my products. This is an advantage because not many brands have this facility. I positively recommend it to everyone.
Went sledding with my daughter. Tends to be crowded at times.
Really nice park for kids if you live nearby.
Great playground with wood chips instead of sand.
"True green spaces in the city are to be protected and looked after. This is one such green space. Great spot to unwind and relax or walk your dog. Enjoy the trees and oh, the squirrels. Lots of squirrels."
Its beautiful here in the fall.
"A very nice place to happen upon while out for a walk in the area. Parc Saint-Gabriel has a pleasant feel. Walking through it does not seem as if some artificially human made destination, created just to add some green space in an otherwise residential and some commercial area. There are pieces of art type-esque additions that were added but are not intrusive, rather, they're complementary. The trees are the calming charm - old enough to be developed. There is a path that diagonally goes through the park which is convenient if headed to the nearby commercial destinations however the green space would be an enjoyable place to have a picnic, sit and read or throw around a frisbee. It's not especially large but does not feel cramped. Street parking."
"A beautiful little Park in the heart of Point Saint Charles,,, right next to Saint Gabriels elementary school. A great place to read a book,,, feed the squirrels,,, and watch the birds as you enjoy the afternoon away! Remember to pay it forward everybody peace out and have a great day!!!"
You could relax
Relaxing
"Nice little park with a good number of benches, great for a light morning coffee & pastry. I love the trees; they are huge. it's nice to have little patches of green space and the diagonal path cutting through is handy."
"Feels safe at night. Looks good, its small, overall a nice place to sit for a couple minutes to eat your lunch or something."
"Love the new jungle gym that they gave the kids. Always see kids playing around here, not much crime in this area anymore thanks to this park. Kids always have something to do and stay out of trouble :)"
"Its a quaint little park with outdoor rinks for ice skating and hockey. There's a playground for kids, green space, benches, baseball, and a splash pad in the warmer months."
A great park for sitting and playing with your pet.
Peaceful and well lighted in the night. Many seats.
Nice calm park for a picnic
Great park my spot
Lovey park loads of history foliage flowers
Just a Park with benchs to chill
Some really old trees are in this park.
Lot of ‚ùÑ
"Petite oasis de verdure agr√©able, beaucoup de bancs, mais les chemins asphalt√©s sont en mauvais √©tat."
"This is a great place to watch the sun set. Great place for people watching, Running, having a BBQ and just enjoying the weather with a touch of nature."
"A very good spot for a picnic. Waterfront, plenty of space. The only thing that I did not enjoy is the proximity of the road. Nevertheless, overall it'sa winner."
"Love the place for biking, fishing, picnicking and many more activities."
Nice for fishing and watching the sunset. Would prefer if it was wider and closer to public transportation. But very pleasant to stroll around.
Clean peaceful and quiet place to relax and watch the sunset
"Wouldn't personally classify it as a park per se, more of a stretch of land by the water, nice quiet space to sit and reflect, watch the water, and possible animals as they go about their lives. At the time I was there there weren't too many cars driving by so I could imagine having a qauint picnic there and just enjoying the view and tranquility"
I love Lachine.
Nice place for a shoreside walk
Beautiful sunset.
Awesome place for outdoor picnics at the waterfront!
This is beautiful park
"This park is a good place to go and relax a little. Summertime is very popular. You can see boats in the water and people doing watersports. You can take good pictures there. It's a good place to do exercise, walk, run etc. By sunrise and sunset you can see lots of photographers and people taking videos and selfies. It is good to take pictures near the water because you can see reflection and that's good.
Happy shooting."
"Nice but lacking final touch and details.  Cracked, broken asphalt and in some places big piles of gravel dropped in the middle of a jogging track"
beautiful and historical place
Beautiful place to relax
It's very beautiful park and peaceful
Waterfront park connecting to other parks along the waterfront.
Nice park

"beau parc, belle piscine"
Beautiful area in old Montreal.
Excellent exhibition of the archeological dig of Canada's first Parliament building. Very informative
Nice place
A historic symbol thou missed by many for what it is and the foundation of roots to Montr√©al it is still a worthy stop for anyone in the city.
"Almost everywhere you turn in Old Montreal you will find some history and a place to take a time out in the park if you are on the move. I stopped here in April of 2018 so their wasn't much green on the ground but I imagine the summer months this is a beautiful spot. You are within steps of all kinds of coffee shops, stores and restaurants."
"Small museum with a brief rather dull description of the history of Montreal. 2nd floor is another small and rather dull description of Expo 67. Given the dramatic history of Montreal and the huge surprise success that was Expo 67, there is no excuse for this lame presentation of either subject. There are so many great things to see and do in Montreal, give this one a miss."
"History, not bad but you know: white pll history allways gets dark lol...killing Natives and taking their land...prepare for that kind of ish"
Fun place to walk around
Scenic and quiet corner in the historic center.
"Place de la Grande Paix is where the ""grand peace"" was signed between the French habitants and over 30 Amer-indian tribes.  It finally made Montreal and the surrounding area safe for settlement.

The Montreal Pioneers Monument and some commemorative plaques can be found in the ""place"".

The Montreal History Museum is located at one end (very good and inexpensive)."
Nice place to relax.
"Nice place
Educational
Helpful staff
Not very crowded"
Beautiful place in Montreal! Belle place!
Montreal's history from old times to recent
Just O.K.

High pedestrian traffic but worth an afternoon
Very nice
Beautiful
Wow
Greater  place
Such a good experience
Good
"This park does not have a sand box around the playground, artificial turf is used instead.
This represents a change of time and concept, putting safety, comfort and sanitary before the traditional concept of letting children to play in sandbox to build social, interactive and communication scale.
While enjoying the new age park and playground, parents should never forget the first ever playground in North America was just a pile of sand. Encourage your children to reach out while enjoying this modern setup."
This is a great park in the Saint-Laurent area
"Nice place, it's crowded on weekends. Only problem is that the floor artificial and you get static discharge all the time. It hurts LOL"
Sandless park with section for smaller children and another for older.
Very positive experience so far
Asphalt cork ground very safe and clean.
Very nice little park for parents who dislike sand.
Great new public park.
Excellent
Wow!  Parc parfait pour les enfants. Tr√®s privil√©gi√© de vivre pr√®s de cette endroit
"Lots of activities for everyone of all ages. Mostly well maintained, few areas need some bench replacement but thats about it."
It‚Äôs best park for splash pad..
A good set of different types of sports
"Beautiful and clean, problem is that food is far"
Wawe it's good
"Good skatepark, good vibes"

Nice but very busy park especially during the pandemic.
"A complete entertainment for football, swimming and fitness"
Spacious and nice park
One of my favorites Parcs in Montreal!!!
Nice park. Picnic tables and benches everywhere.
I go there every few days! nice place to go time to time
"Nice park for a multiple of activities. Multiple splash pad areas right next to the playground area. A big field for festivals and a baseball diamond. Also has a big indoor sports center with swimming pools, basketball court, cafe and much more. Also park has a dog area, Bixi station and lots of benches & tables for picnics and relaxing in the outdoors."
Great for kids
My favourite park!  It offers everything for a family to enjoy a sunny day in. The splash park the most popular I think along with the jungle gym.  The indoor swimming pool and gym not far away.  Very friendly community center at service to all N.D.G. residents.
"Loved our time at Parc Benny! My 4 years old was ecstatic to see the water park had opened! Also happy to see the park was a bit cleaner than last summer.. still few junk near the water park, maybe to install a couple more garbage bin as now there are just one. But definately üëçüèæ for the change this year."
"Great park behind the sports center and near the library so lots to do for the kids. The park has a sandy section and a foamy mat flooring as well. In the summer, a nice splash pad. A huge field open for use by anyone.

Only thing missing is designated parking, otherwise you're sharing with residents and users of the sports center, the library and the clsc..."
Full of memories.
So calm
"Love the water park! The jungle gym is ok, gets really hot in the summer (no shade)."
"My kids love this park because it has many areas to explore and to do such as the playground with sand, the splash pad is large and clean enough. It has a big green area, and also a skateboard area with some obstacles to learn.

Every time we go my kids know or expect to go to the indoor pool or the activities they NDG sports center has. And the Library next to the park is huge and a new building, with a large area for children and youth."
"Between cultural center and sport center, with nice kids and family area. Love this parc!"
Cork playground. Nice water park. Not bad skating rink (if clean)
"A local park for the community. The NDG sport centre is right besides it. The playground does not have that much of equipment but still kids enjoy playing in there. During summer time the water play area is open and is quite fun for kids to ply. The grass filed can be used for soccer. Also there is a baseline field. In the west side of the park, you can bring your scooter or skateboard to play."
"Community hub, aquatic center, playground, greenspace and splash pad.
Great outdoor activities all year round.
Close to recreation center, for indoor activities"
"Cozy casual place for sports, water park for the kids or just hanging out under trees. Nearby rec center and library too"
Lot of attraction for kids and adults (Lol). Had fun there
"Great neighborhood park,  next to community center,  across from wonderful library. Nice play areas for kids."
Great outdoor space located beside a library and public pool as well as having great playgrounds and an excellent splash pad.
"A great place to swim and do various activities, especially if you have young children. The family pool is great for teaching young ones to swim. The staff is great, but the changerooms are small and cramped with few stalls and showers available. The park and splash pad are great in the summer."
üíò this place. Kids play in a safe area watched by parents. Lots to do. Lots of activities.
"Benny  park is a really great place to go. There is plenty to do there. Skatepark, baseball diamond, modern playground, splash pad, lots of space with benches, not to mention the awesome Benny sports center."

"Has good splash park, playground, skate park, large field, indoor pool and sports complex. New library across the road"
Very nice place to pass the time with kids 8
Great place for babies and toddlers to play
"Sub par child's playground with few and unexciting structures. No shade around playground, but large brushes that obstruct parents' view. Loyola park, and Confederation park playgrounds are much better. Numerous trees were cut down some years ago (2010) to build an enclosed, year round pool. They were never replanted/replaced. There is a small, nice water-park next to the playground that had some shade. A recent microburst (2017) brought down those trees. There is a skateboard park that sees a lot of use."
Large beautiful space you can find yourself comfortable seating at any angle of the park and feel the peace and quiet moments in your heart on the side facing canendish Monkland there is the library also CLSC on Benny Angle a Play ground equipped with water for the summer on Terrebonne street there is a church that one can enter and say a prayer to the Creator and in the middle of all this there is a Recreation center there are pleasures for those who visited PARC Benny in this warm friendly environment please take the time to visit because we experience things in different ways my peace and love to all God bless

Very nice place with full majesty of St.Lawrence at view..Decent number of places for sitting..toilet available..not far from Metro station.
Connecting from Parc St. Louis - just perfect for a long refreshing walk. Pathway for pedestrians cleared off and cross country path.
Very beautiful park first time in there very quiet and peaceful can't wait for Spring to visit it again
Love taking walks along the water this is a great location!
It's a lovely walk/bike ride along the riverside. Some chairs were placed here and there to take the sun and appreciate the nice view. There's even people fishing... Lovely place!

"Linear park along the lake, no parking available
Walkable from dairy queen on 32nd and saint Joseph"

"It's a really nice place to watch the sun set and rise, makes for a really cool shot over the water! Gets flooded during rain season and inaccessible for most of winter but still really pretty"
"Great bike trail, beautiful sunset. It's hard to believe this place is located on the island of Montreal"
I'm kind of bais as I live hear and love to go for walks and run around this area.  I just wish the city would put money into fixing up all of the water side parks in lachine.
Gorgeous! A great place to walk and enjoy the landscape.‚òÄÔ∏è
"This bike path was flooded somewhat ih the early spring, but cleated up to pass in early may. The bike path leads through Lachine, Lasalle, Verdun, Lachine canal. On to St. Henri and the Atwater Market. You may go on to the Vieux Port, with the many touristes etc. You can start a beautiful Stoney Point Park, or also maybe Dorval at Pine Beach Park has much parking."
Calm. Clean. Beautiful view. Safe for family.
Beautiful place
"This is a very nice park, without much furniture: only the odd bench or picnic table. It is flat and wide, and has some nice but sparse trees. It is crisscrossed by many foot paths, and is traversed by the Lachine canal bicycle path. Dogs are allowed on a leash, but not only during the daytime. It‚Äôs a wide part of the otherwise narrow public lakefront strip that spans almost all of the burrow of Lachine‚Äôs lakefront. This strip exists thanks to the old city of Lachine that had a policy to return the banks of lac St-Louis to the citizens.  There is a war memorial statue, dedicated ‚ÄúTo our Soldier‚Äù at the top end. This 1925 piece by Alfred Lalibert√© was recently moved here by the burrow of Lachine, which is somewhat fitting considering that during the first world war, this park was used as a depot for military horses in transit to the European battlefields."
Beautiful park and awesome lakeside view.
Great location for a bike ride break
Beautiful water front bike path.

"This is my childhood park, it's nice.

It has green grass in the summer and sno le in the Winter.

I love going there as it reminds me of my troubling childhood.. psych. As it reminds me of good times I had there as a child.

Want basketball, you got it, want to swing on swings? Got it. Want line dance? That's Thursday.

I really like it .

Oh and they have a dog park too"

Very limited parking, no fence to protect little kids from the streets."
"Nice park with a lot to do like basket ball, soccer, tennis and it has a very beautiful dog park"
Too many kids\people not wearing masks

"5 stars since it is a well kept park. It is a beautiful saturday afternoon and it's quiet here, not to many people, a few kids playing with the water games, 2 tenis players, a lady sleeping on a blanket in the grass. Sad to see no dogs in the cute dag park. But... Plenty of butterflies and a nice blue sky. Perfect day and perfect place."
Great place for kids...
Family style park with tennis and basketball playground. Field for kids to play and spend time with parents. Clean and safe area with no traffic. Free parking is available always. Good for book reading and excersize.

Great place for families.
To meet a friend
5 Beautiful tennis courts!
great park for family
Great pokestops
I usually go there as its the nearest park to my house. Only concerned that why can't we have a washroom in the park in case of emergency for kids. Otherwise it's good and 90% clean most of the time. One more issue is that few people regularly smoke inside the park and really don't know if they are actually allowed to do so or they just don't care about the kids. Thanks
Summers have just begun. Love hitting the balls in the cricket nets.
"Nice little park, too small as compared to the population around"
Good looking park in the middle of the ghetto
"This is an ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù park, not much in terms of scenery but it‚Äôs a good place for picnic with the family. In the summer there are water games for kids to play on a hot day and in the winter there is a ice rink for skating or playing hockey. There is also a basketball court if you want to shoot some balls in a hoop. Not much else to say since this a just your average run-of-the-mill city park."
Fun place to spend time with family at.
"You can have a good time on the way, take some rest & chill."
Feel very fresh and peaceful...great greenery!!
"Well done Howard, great park."
Great to see one can play different sports
It sucks.  Terrible ambiance.  Parks are all about ambiance.  This one doesn't have it.  1 star for the fact it exists.
"The park is well maintained and an ideal place to spend an evening. Also, the cricket nets are pretty solid."
My hometown...... There used to be a baseball diamond here many years ago. Brought back many memories.
Good place for huge gathering and party. Popular for various activities and community based fairs and rally.
Friendly
Good parc

This park is so well thought of. Stuff to do for kids. And super cute!
Great place thoughtfully put together. Especially the basketball court
"Very nice place for the water part and modules but it lacks shadow hover the modules. Trees are very small and not providing enough shadow yet.
On very hot and sunny days the modules can get very very hot."
"Excelent installations, everything is brand new and the city is keeping it very clean. I dont live in the area but I wish I could visit more this spot"
Very nice and well maintain clean park. Except there's no washroom so what happen is the kids pee behind the bushes. Every park must have a washroom the kids play more than 1 hour and families goes there for picnic so what's gonna happen after they going to need washroom. The city must provide that otherwise this place will he trash and smells.
My son loves his new park!
This is a new great park for kids for all ages.
Really fun place to be with the kids.
My favorite park in St Leonard

"Probably my favourite park east of Parc La Fontaine, this one is much more quaint, smaller, narrower and less assuming but it isn‚Äôt too far away. A good place to abscond to if the other spot is too crowded. This place never seems to get too jammed but it always has a particular vibe to it I feel."
The parc is cool. I really liked it. It just need to be a bit more clean.
"Quiet was nice to eat lunch, could use a washroom around the area."
Nice park with lots of mature trees and water fountain.
"Cozy, clean, and amazing place with every kind of person with great vibes"

One of the best parks in mtl
"James Baldwin , Governor of Upper Canada ,Fort York along with Louis Hippolyte LaFontaine, lower Canada Governor crafted what later became the Confederation of Canada.Two City parks, both located in Plateau Mont Royal neighbourhood. Baldwin w/ large public pool.Lafontaine Theatre Verdure, a summer stage. Both venues free"

"It's a very nice park, but in this moment (spring & summer 2021)  they are renovating the water park so it's noisy."

Had a great time with the kids. Playground is great for little kids. Lots of shaded green space areas for relaxing.
Beautiful park with a nice dog park

"Water fountain, and water shower for kids, not of trees and green space to play, rest or BBQ. Large enough for a lot of people or groups to enjoy at the same time."
"Big park bordered by cool houses. Good energy, it‚Äôs the little brother of Laurier park."
"Took my little one to the children's park. It's very nice but could be gated better, hence why 4/5. The playground is great for little kids"
Nice park with lots of shading from trees! It has a few metalic stands to hook 3 hammocks onto.

Beautiful setting in a calm area.
"Chill parc, great swimming pool"
Perfect place for a date!
Treasure in the heart of plateau.
Just popped by to see the graffiti and take a picture of my beer.
Had outstanding atmosphere and was full of great people and scenic views! Great place to take the kids out to fly a kite!
Your standard Montreal park with many tables and benches. Great for picnics or just hanging out. The park is separated by a street though...so it's technically 2 parks?
Such a great park...and very safe during the day...albeit a bit busy. The playground is almost constantly occupied by daycare children along with their educators. It's a fairly large pack and the location is very central. It even has an outdoor pool!
Sweet park with many parts
Perfect ending for bicycle trip. natural environment with excellent view
Five star hot dogs and beer. Fun place to hangout.
Nice place to stop well bixi biking for a little rest. Was nice to watch the dogs place in the dog run.
There is always free yoga class on Wednesday night during summer time and it is so cozy and relaxing there.
Cool places for a picnic
Small but beautiful and cosy park. There is a fountain in the middle.  Close to the swimming pool that is comfortable in summer especially after yoga in the park.
"Nice public pool. Lacks trees or umbrella for shade. Very hot of late, then again, it's pretty hot out there."
Beautiful park in a nice neighborhood. Great park for a picnic.

The very nice and cozy park! There's a playground near by.
Not that much seating.
It's a generic park. Not much else to say.
"Nice park, great location to meditate or ""recharge your batteries"""
Great place to hangout if youre an introvert.
Love this outdoor pool but you still have to pay to access it. I thought. Montr√©al pools are supposed to be free.
You have got to love this place
The best place to take the kids to play! We loved!

There is also a play area for young children and a small water park with change rooms and bathroom. Gas bbqs are allowed while coal bbqs are prohibited."
Lovely park for kids. Just the parking is a difficult
Way chiller than Lafontaine!  Opt for this instead of the big park.
Spatious and pretty
One of the best playgrounds we've visited. The splashing area and the tables for a picnic are a good option for the summer.
The grass is green and it's a quality park
"Ran two hours around the round garden in the middle of the gravel intersections. Couldn't decide where to go next so I just kept running. Overall, I give my 2 hour experience a grueling 10 stars. Would run again.

P.s.: I might have crushed some of your snail...sorry."

Beau parc mais il y a beaucoup de monde !
Bo p'tit parc!
:) :(
"Parc avec beaucoup d'arbres ce qui est bien surtout pour l'√©t√©. Des jeux d'eau temporaire son install√© mais reste limit√©. Les airs de jeux son plut√¥t bien avec balan√ßoires, toboggans, √©chelles,...
Je met que 3 √©toiles pour les jeux d'eau qui manquent."
Nice area
Its amazing place .
Nice park and working distance to a metro.

Amazing park. Go Sundays. Good softball.
"I went to this park because I am a member of  a community gardens club  in point saint Charles...and one of it is situated inside this park..as far I know it's a  large space  consisting of various playgrounds for all age groups...
Mostly visited by surrounding area residents..."
Banks of the St. Lawrence River. Peace.
Decent place to hit some dongers.
Baseball park that is relatively well cared for. One chemical toilet available for emergencies.
The power pilon needs to go. A  nice park though
The place where Magnotta tried to hide someone's head
"Walk through here every day to get to work, it's nice."
"Nice to found a functional baseball park, with lights, toilets and a water fountain!"

It has a great softball field.
Peaceful and beautiful. Weather permitting
Very good park
Not much happening here. Baseball diamond only.
Great softball field.
Ball time
Great place
Poor
Build a fog park!
Rough around the edges but it does the job well....it's a softball and baseball field
Beautiful
"Baseball diamond, walking distance to a metro. Not much else here."
Correct
I love this parc specially the smell of the ground after rain
"Nice place to relax. There is also playground, lawn, basket ball court, picnic tables, a parking close by."
Great for a walk. You can see ducks and geese in the right season.
"It's a big park with many open spaces that are excellent for outdoor workouts or just plain lounging around in summer. There's also a nice, newly fixed up skateboard park here too!"
"Calm and quiet at night, great skate park too!"
"Pretty view on the water, open spaces to play great park!"
Spacious dog park and great riverside place to hangout
It is a very peaceful place to sit and relax
Fantastic place with beautiful beach and biking lines! ü§ó
"Amazing for kids on winter, they have slides going on and you can rent tubes"
"This park is good for exercises practice, because it has a lot options (baseball court, tennis court and running/cycling tracks, public pool). At this time (May/2019), there are a lot of construction going, which makes the experience there less enjoyable (but constructions are temporary)"
"Lots of open spaces, beaches, baseball grounds, tennis courts, cycle tracks, running tracks etc. Ideal for athletes and outings"
Good park with park things. Not my favorite by the river but it's nice.
"Nice park. Good baseball fields, splash pad for kids and a skate park"
"Goodpark. Beach nearby makes it even better. Perfect for family gathering, picnik, sports & activities. Maybe city could install Wi-Fi to make experience more enjoyable."
Large parks with lot of activities.
"Great park, summer or winter."
Beautiful! Right next to the river
Awesome place for sunsets
Great skatepark! Beautiful layout and surrounded by very nice park.
Beautifull skatePark. Mostly for every skateboard style you can imagine ! Attention aux trottinettes sans parents superviseur. Papa and Mama should stay close to their kids and teach them to behave properly in a dangerous sport area.
Free tennis court in the afternoon üòÅ
Very large
The view from the river was excellent. Recommend you to take your dog there!
"Superb bicycle path along the water front. This park is rather long which makes it all the more interesting for a spin. Add to that a pool, a skatepark, children-specific play areas, even an ice cream vendor and you have a five star park. Oh yeah, it's right next to the metro."
Its a small skatepark. Near waterfront. Its very quiet most of the time.
What happened with the walk path?
Great place in the summer even a skateboard parcel and a swimming pool and lots of place to picnic
nice park for people living in the vicinity
Always clean and managed
Love this skate park. The layout and obstacles are different from the other parks I know. Especially love the painted curbs and the fact that there are many smaller obstacles and jumps that you don't have to be a pro for to use. The kids love it too.
My son loves this good sized skate park.
"there's something for everyone. There's a skatepark for people who loves these kind of sports. Also there's two structures for kids of different ages. Finally, there a football field, a baseball field, tennis courts, a basketball court and a public swimming pool."
"Great park. Skate park, and kids park, boarding on the waterfront."
"Swimming pool, water games, park, skate park, basketball court. A lot of things to do on a nice summer day.
Winter has sledding with tube/sled rentals and skating with skate rentals."
Skate park. Baseball diamonds. Tennis courts. Tons of kids stuff. A pool. The beach.
Had a great morning tobogganing here. It has a nice size hill for families with young kids.
"One of the perks of living in Verdun: the super long waterfront, rich with people and activities and facilities."
Loving it.  Very relaxing.
Big park on the board walk swimming pool and first weekend of Aug there is a nice softball tournament call point wish
"Basketball, tennis, baseball, skatepark, pool, beach, this spot has it all"
"Its great for hold family events! Playing basket ball. There's a baseball site and access to toilet in the pavillon. The aquajet for the kids is open when summer hit. The slide is broken at the child park. I hope the town will fix it very soon! The swimming pool and the skateboard park can be free for even BMX. There is water fountain and picknic table. But there is no barbecue on this site. The hospital of Verdun just beside and the parking that cost you ticket is only for the hospital. There is construction about the Arena beside so they take over the parking place for the park, beside the swimming pool. And thereis the Verdun Beach that is under construction. The metal slide is much better than those plastic one."

It's alright
"A complete parc with football ground, lake, water fountain for kids and adults. Wisely created hill for snow spots in winter. Sitting on side chair with warm sunbathing and watching football will add you an awesome experience. I can spend a whole day watching the birds playing in the lake. I go there to read something important so that I can memorize it for the long time"
"Great park with several facilities for activities. From sledding, to hockey, to soccer fields, the park is a beautiful place in the heart of Outremont. No wonder it attracts many families and is fairly crowded some popular holidays. I wish there were more parks like this one."
"We went skating here on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
As we arrived, they were clearing the ice rinks, there are two, and the Zamboni cleaned the ice.
Good ice skating surface.  Would prefer if hockey sticks not allowed on one of the surfaces...there is a dedicated hockey rink but obviously insufficient for some ‚Äúenthusiasts‚Äù who spill over onto adjacent rink.
Gets real busy around 2-3pm...try going earlier...enjoy"
"I like it, it's quiet, clean, and good for reading or spending quality time with a family member"
"Excellent park for families and individuals with plenty of benches, trees and a large active fountain ‚õ≤ which seems to be enjoyed by many.
An great place for morning workouts in groups as great grass coverage as well as for family or friends picnics."
During winter : Come before 9.30am if you want to put your kids on a sled : you‚Äôll have all the parc just for you.
Perfect winter park for families. There are two skating areas and several hills of different sizes for tobagoning or whatever...
A calm and beautiful place to relax in the evenings!
Beautiful park with great scenery
"Fun fresh and big, good for table picnics"
Favorite Park in the city. Year round activities for families.
"Very lovely place, quiet atmosphere. Nice pond."
"great parc for kids and adults! It has a soccer field, basketball nets, water foutains and play structures!"
It's a wonderful place to take your kids & have some fun outside!!!
"Nice big park with a couple of small football fields, lots of open space, kids playground and waterpark. A couple of picnic tables, a fountain (not meant for swimming) and a little pond. I am not sure about toilet facilities though."
"Very beautiful park. Felt like it was well hidden too, to avoid too many people if you need peaceful moments."
Great sledding fun
Really nice place
This is the best place to play soccer. I used to go there every day during my lunch period
Great family park. Wonderful ambiance
Beautiful park for kids.
Awesome!
Good to be there
Wainting for winter to come & enjoy the summer over here.
üëå but the name is misleading
The scenery here is so beautiful!
Great swimming pool and Amazing Life Guards on staff
"Outremont has many nice parks. I often walk across Parc Beaubien but I am never tempted to stop there. It is well kept, has a little waterfall and pond, a few tables for picnic, children playgrounds. But it is located between a high school and the busy Cote Sainte Catherine road and does not have many benches to sit down. It is alright but not the finest in Outremont."
Nice big space. Parking might be an issue however.
"A great Park and playground, suitable areas for all ages."
Beautiful family park
"It is a beautiful park, is big and there are different activities to do"
"Love the water games, nice older turf soccer field"
Great Hill for sledding!

"lovely little park to walk through and take the dog too!!!grass is green, trees are healthy, backyards from neighbouring houses are mostly fenced in and there are benches and a spot with free dog bags for little accidents!!!"
Beautiful! Worth a visitüòÄ
Very nice place to read peacefully
"Nice little park, usually quite"
Quiet lil space. Right off the path.
Best park around here
Great park
"You can walk your dog on leash, big green space"
Hidden little park. The bike path goes right through it.
Ok park....prefer it before they spend half a million on renovating it with our tax dollars.  That money could have been spend in our community program.
Small park to relax.
Nice seats and great place to protest
Nothing
Small park not to much to do there with children
"Large tree shade. Big Table. Swing playground for big kids. Child-only playgrounds. a clean, well-maintained, perfect crop park"
"Beautiful park, great for kids, dog walking and sports. It has a good walking path around the park. Never gets too busy which I like. A few picnic tables and benches. A good wide open space. I wish people picked up the dog poop more though üôÑ"
"Good park but next to a busy boulevard. It's gated and safe, just noisy."
Nice park with a lot of grass areas. Good for kids too. And playing football
Met gala : camping so camp
so nice place
"Great place to enjoy the sun, play soccer, or do some outdoors activities like Taichi or yoga"
Good place for the kids.
"Great neighbourhood park. Perfect for young children as they'll find plenty to play with in the playground or sandbox. There's also a pretty big soccer field with nets. I believe its lit from 1 or 2 lightposts. And for daycamps the city opens the chalet for restrooms. The place is fenced. Coffeshop across the street, next to a church and school."
Stunparc
Great place!
You can bring your dog here. This is winer.
Clean and quiet.
Cool!

It's okay. Small park good for young kids. Decent shade and fenced in on 3 sides.
"Love it, very nice option for ice skating."
"Clean park that's always full of life in the summer. I especially like the tiny free library and try to contribute to it when I can. Other community projects would be very cool to see in the future, like a garden perhaps? Also, I love the changes to the new playground! üòä"
There‚Äôs a big Public swimming pool that they let you IN every hour and let you remain for 50 mins.
It was lovely nice & dry; but way too crowded for comfort. I didn't  spend time I walked by
Awesome local parc.
Adorable wading pool. Nice play ground for little kids
"Nice little park in Outremont. Recently renovated kids play area. Has a nice although fairly expensive pool, even if you‚Äôre a resident. Pool also recently renovated. Only concrete around the pool, so no lounging on any grass. Get extremely crowded on hot days especially weekends. Consider the Mont Royal pool if this one is packed. Much nicer and actually cheaper!"
"Ok, so this is a great park for kids.  Lots of infrastructures for them, lots of space and plenty of benches for the moms to sit with strollers and watch their kids.  I, however, could not hear myself think.  I couldn't drown out the din with my head phones."
Large park with swimming attractions.
"Great park. Two pools, the small one free, structures that are for little and bigger kids. Another plus is that there is an available washroom while the wading pool is open. Definitely recommend this park. All that's missing are some mokey bars."
Nice park to hang out.
"Four words I'd never been more glad to utter in this broiling weather: THE POOL IS OPEN!  Plus someone answered my prayers and put a bathroom next to the patagueoire which - unfortunately - missed out on the renovation except for a lick of paint. The playground has been open since winter after being thoughtfully converted to serve the surrounding daycares better. Yup, sorry not sorry teenagers - you'll have to find another place to do loop-de-loops on the swings."
Nice place to sit in the sun or eat lunch outside. The kid's playground is nice and there is an open air public pool.
It's a very beautiful and relaxing place.
Very nice swimming pool
Concrete for small kids?
Lovely
Nice pool
Nice pool
Ok park with pool

Very good place to relax in Canada. There is also internet.
"Crowded, but beautiful. The stagnant water might be a problem for bugs in the summer"
Cute little park. Looks like mostly young people hang out there üòÇ
Pretty small and cozy park with a lovely lake.
Beautiful place to relax and have a picnic.
Very nice place
The children's park fence door has been broken for over 2 weeks still not repaired. It's kind of important seeing that the kids can just run out of the park area...pond nearby. Other than that very clean and well maintained. The bathroom is open and clean with a full soap dispenser. The ducks are back! ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü
"Nice mini lake and cool bridge. I like how you can walk under it too, kinda sketchy but wtv. Also this park has ducks and ducks are cool."
Nice relaxing park
Nice ice for skating in the winter
Good ice conditions
Ice loop wasn't well maintained
"Beautiful park four seasons, winter skating"
Cute!
I have very found memories from this park from my childhood
"Nothing much to this park.  No great architecture or monuments.  Still very tranquil to walk through the man made river.  There was an awesome dance lesson/competition/performance when I was there.  Plenty of shops, restaurants and places to walk to around this neighborhood."
"The most uncommon park. Very quiet, nice place to relax."
Cute little park. Something about the grass tho... Why is the ground so hard?
Love the water around such a good idea !
Great open space. Very good playground. Fenced and safe. Lots of squirrels to chase with my grandson.
Nice and relaxing parc for the family.
Very good playground for kids. Lots of grass for the kids to run around.
Nice stroll and little daughter time .

Super!
The water is really dirty
It is a really nice park
nice park
Nice park
good place
The electrical tower is gone and the adjacent land is being reclaimed. The park is clean and the sand / gravel keeps your feet dry during a light rain. Lots of room for your dog to run and most dogs are well socialized.
Finally a dog park.
close by the Saint Lawrence River..good area for walks and Bicking..with nice views.
It's a great place for the kids to safely run and play.
It's a beautiful park located along the river besides the cycling path. Great way to enjoy the outdoors nature within the city during the summer months.
"Lasalle recently built a new dog park here and it is great! Water fountain for the pups and their humans, big space for running, and there are even lights now. The sand is dirty but drains very well and doesn't hurt the little guys paws. Also a good gang of pet owners."
It's a nice place visit because it's close to the waterfront. There's also lots of space for dogs to run.
Beautiful park
"Great place,  highly recommend"
Nice size park with a water fountain for dogs and humans.  Would be better if it had grass instead of sand.
Nice clean outdoor pool with long opening times. Free for citizens.
Great
amazing
A dog park and  a baseball park
Ok small park
Cool
Nice place for children to walk and see nature . Place for young to bike on trailr
"Good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in some other places.

Good quality stuff!

I would go there every time in the future.

You should look at what they offer and choose what is best for you!

Very nice place and I will go there again in the future, I like that is not far from where I live and it‚Äôs not very busy in the week-ends.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find it pleasant easy accessible and comforting."
I like this place for walking more when it is summer
Great nice park with lots of places to sit
Small park with ping pong table and benches. The swimming pool is just close by.
Beautiful waterfall entrance
Cool skate spot
"This park is quite peaceful, and its always clean. If you have kids, this is the perfect place to bring them."
"Smaller park, good location, water area for kids, baseball field, pavilion in the middle. Nice spot"
"La mejor pista que encontrado para patinar muy amplia bien iluminada,

The best place for skeat I'm found is big enough for enjoy skating and don't feel like crash with everyone"
"Ice quality was ok, no boards, ice surface is delimited with snow, some individuals playing with pucks, not more than 2 together but they were mindful, ice surface is close to the road consequently, if you have skate guards, skates can be put on sitting on the car seat with the door open and you can walk to the ice surface leaving your boots in the car"
Perfect little park to relaxe in Villeray. Have a nice pic nic with the family or just with friends. Lot's of open space in the grass and also offer ping pong tables to play for free. Water area for the kids and petancle space for the elderly or anyone who enjoys the game.
Mon favorite
Nice to come and relax
Beautiful

In the winter you have a skating / hockey rink. There is a cabin so you can change or to warm up.
On the other side of the park you have an archery section. There is a fee for its use."
"Really nice park.  There a little water ""pool"" for kids, a playground, in the winter there's a outdoor skating ring, it's big enough to enjoy but not to big to get lost in"
Good infrastructure
Chill
"Good local park, outdoor rink in the winter, archery, wading pool, brand new kids park( under construction)"

Small and limited
"Now the weather is getting better, this park is perfect to go and bring your kids to this place. The area of this park is beautiful and clean. It is not only for kids, you can go also with your pet or date and walk around and enjoy the park and the view. Near the park, are also restaurant and other business where you can go also."

love this park...
"C'est le parc de mon enfance/adolescence. Aujourd'hui, j'y am√®ne mon fils de 3 ans. Il s'y amuse comme un petit fou. Il y a toujours pas mal d'enfants les soirs de semaine et les fins de semaine. C'est un parc o√π r√®gne la gaiet√©. La seule chose qui serait un bonus dans ce parc, c'est s'ils ajoutaient des jeux d'eau. Alors l√†, l'exp√©rience serait parfaite pour les tout-petits."
Grands et beaux espaces
"If you live in Verdun or happen to be visting, you don't need to look far to find a public park. There are several parks with a variety of names that run parallel to the St-Lawrence River. You can just choose one or go park hopping from one to the next."
üëå
"Small park next to the water in Verdun.
I went there to go to the Crescendo restaurant which is in the park. A peaceful place to collect your thoughts and even, perhaps to walk the dog!"
"Beautiful park for the whole family. If you can go now in the fall is even better. Sunrise and the sunset are the best time to go. You can also walk your dog there, your kids can play or just admire the place. It is relaxing place."
Very nice park.
Nice ice cream and gift shop
"Not the Verdun you knew 10-15 yrs ago.... This park has access to many different activities all within a 10 min walk. Muliple play areas for kids of all ages, resturants, ice cream shop, extensive jogging/cycling trail, dock, etc"
It is an amazing park with too many different activities.
"Breezy, clean, water view."
Muy bello  parque
Kids love the park very much
Park has a variety of activities and is well maintained.
"If you're looking for a safe and fun halloween, THIS is where you want to be.  The whole park is converted into a themed halloween.  Last year it was Day of the Dead (tastefully done for little ones) activities, candy stations, haunted house, many MANY entertainers, fireworks and cherry on my sundae... the spotlights everywhere give off enough heat to make it comfortable for everyone.

The neighbouring streets have an 80% participation.  Hoises are decorated, people standing outdoors in costume handing out candy.  It feels like we're back in the 80s when it was safe to trick or treat, kids flooded the streets and people talked to each other.

I have been coming here with my kid since 2011 and plan to keep coming here until he says ""mom... im too old to trick or treat"".

Try it - you won't regret it."
It's a good park but always has a lot of kids .
"Lots of place for kids to play, two zones, about 3 big modules and. A couple of small one.  There is a square with water jets, but get some sandals.  Close to city‚Äôs pool and they‚Äôre is a toilet near (small walk).  Also water in summer is available near the pool to drink."
Amazing place.
Perfect for young kids
Great park.
Super cool kids event for Halloween!
"It's very open, spacious, easy to supervise the children. It's fenced in for safety"
This park is beautiful and a good place to take pictures. You can bring your kids because there is a playground. People here play softball and soccer. And you can bring your pet.
The dog love it and the waterfountain for them is great ! ( the park is all rocks and no grass for anyone wondering ) üòä
The dogs have to run on gravel and cannot bark without being told to be quiet by a man across the street!
"Decent park with play area, pool and soccer field."
Love it  lot of fun for kids
"Small park with a fully fenced in play area for toddlers and up, with a small water fountain to play in."
"Great park! Tennis, swimming pool, soccer field. Great Halloween party every year."

In winter cross country skiing  might  work.
"First and foremost, the oversized chairs! Undeniably fun for all ages to snap a picture beside or climbing up to 'site's down.
Dispite being alongside two main artery for driving in the area, the park feels like a mini (midsized) oasis all year round. There's no intrusive sense of surrounding cars both audibly and visually.
There is always parking, which is a huge plus. Public transit seems easy enough, a bus stop at the far corner behind the building next to the park.
Lots of trees and greenery/bushes throughout the place, most notably the tall trees surrounding the place.
Adult and kid friendly with curious artwork and walking winding walking paths on one end and a playground at the far end for kids (and parents!).
The contrast of open areas, nooks of interest along the trails and once again the placement of trees and plantlife make for a lovely destination for some 'outdoorsy' time right amidst the city."
Always a great place for an afternoon walk.
"A beautiful and we'll maintained park and a great place to play Pokemon Go. There are two gyms,  5 pokestops and a nice path to walk around on."
Plugged the car and took a walk
"This Beautiful Green Space,Park is located
adjacent to the LaSalle Municipal Library and close by the Dollard Saint-Laurent Hockey Arena. as well as other park installations designed
for younger Children in mind."
It is a beautiful park but there is nothing special for kids to play with.
üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Little park by the library.
Very quite park with jungle gyms and a library with parking rite next to each other.
Small park near the library
Nice quiet park
"Great place to walk or play sports, but there is no bathroom - how can a large park like that not have any bathrooms !!!   Also pickleball and basketball courts are not maintained, the grounds tend to accumulate a lot of sand and dirt, they should really clean up the concrete play areas, and remove the sand/dirt, because it makes the grounds more slippy, and when playing with a ball the sand / dirt adheres to the ball - My children play basketball there and come back with black hands because their ball accumulates mud and dust as the courts are really in bad shape.   Please use our damn tax dollars to clean the play areas once in a while."
"Played 1st cricket tournament in Canada loved and enjoyed a lot loved the place also, green ground, night match was awesome feel our team lost the match but we did played wellüòÅ but mainly it's a baseball ground with some different sports grounds also. Washrooms, bathrooms available, and a seperate pets ground too."
"Beautiful park overall. Really like the dog park. Never was a fan of dog parks but this one is so wide and spacious, I kinda understand the feeling üòÖ"
"Very nice park for kids can have small kids birthday parties.They have basketball,badminton ,baseball court,kids play areas for small and big kids.During winter ice hockey ground will be there,best place for ice scakting ."
Really really good place for relaxing and walk
Perfect for outdoor sports and running
"Good parc, clean. Lack of social distancing though. Dog park water fountain is gone for now and there's 3 chain links of fence missing as of September 7"
"Excellent place, but too crowded for my liking."
An encounter with a friendly squirrel üêøÔ∏è in cousineau parc
Its a baseball ground basically but cricket is also being played with permission of authorities..
"You can play all sorts of games and do activities here like it has a swimming pool,a football ground and a shed where you can enjoy with your family."
"Nice Park, memories growing up, lots of time spent in this park as a youth."
Great place to go play pick up ball on a nice summer day
"Quite fun, there's always something to do."
This family park is calm and quiet not busy at all.lot of fun for kids.and separate spot for dogs and in the corner of park is bixi bike sharing station and also nearby market
Beautiful place.. children can play all types of games..
"Nice family friendlypark, you can play tennis, basketball, and baseball. Lots of space for kids to play."
I liked that place because it liked me first! :D
My son forgot his school bag at the ice rink and the man that takes care of it was looking for him and was very nice and helpful ...
Great parc that offers many different activities and is linked to Parc Hartenstein which provides even more. You have a baseball field. You have a basketball field which is well maintained (I.e the nets are on the baskets). You have a dog parc and a kid playing area.
A bit better than Petit Park but not by much. In serious need of a revamp as well .
Nice cute little park.
"This was a couple if minutes from where I used to live, I often go there still to walk my dog. I also take my kid there as well, it's very nice and well taken care of, there's fun for the everyone!"
"One of the best parc in the hood. Always busy on sunny days, especially the bball court."
Nice clean park! Great for baseball and basketball!
"Feel relaxed, calm and is very neat and clean,"
Nice place but they don't remove the snow properly so the hates don't always close making it dangerous for the dogs since they can go onto a busy street.
Great ambience!!
Great facilities and safe!
Enjoyable  park visit!

Childhood! Good old days!
Nice park near school
This little-known but quite large park in North East Montreal provides a total natural forest setting. It lacks benches to sit or garbage bins to put your dog poop bags. The little brook down steep inclines is pretty and the fall colours are stupendous. The city is planning a complete overhaul of the area in the near future.
"Certainly not in my top 10 picks, nonetheless worth mentioning.  It does have some charm thanks to the slow cascading brook deep below.  Careful how you get to appreciate this water feature because the area is not the easiest to manoever.  The path is a very good one to walk.  Other than two uncomfortable picnic tables, there is very little seating capacity.  Looking forward to this small nature park by the autoroute blossom in years to come.  Note: There is another entrance point from Boulevard Perras."
Wow. Amazing place. Not a national big park but you absolutely feel a pure beauty of the nature with minimal human touches...where relaxing soothing sound of stream... clear water downstreaming and clapping gently on rocks... A gift from nature for us just right there in town.
Much better than anticipated. A big forest with a small river and waterfall in the middle of city? I never expected to find such a thing!
"Super calm, great riverside natural trail."
What else to say? Enjoy it!
"This is a hidden gem, if you are willing to get off the main trail and hike through the woods. The paths are narrow with a lot of overgrowth, but lovely and the little river is such a delight with the small waterfalls. I saw some interesting birds here as well. I suggest long pants or bug spray and good shoes."
Nice park in city for a walk. Dogs allowed!
Love walking along the paths and visiting the water falls
Best Robin Hood style forest in the heart of Montreal-Nord...üëç
"Hidden Gem, amazing walk and best worth if you decide to take the kind of a hidden track. A go to place if your in the area"
"It's very beautiful park! Special in Fall.
It's good for relaxed and hiking.
Love the water fall!"
Beautiful and peaceful great for walking and relaxing
Not really worth the detour..
Nice little walk just watch out for speedy cyclists
Beautiful park!? Its one of the smaller parks in montreal but this one has a beautiful waterfall thats not easily attainable but well worth it once you've seen it. Although I wouldn't trust the bench that's there.
My go to place to relax üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mini gem
Beautiful park . Small but if you walk down you can find a small stream.
I walked in about a km and did not find anything interesting but just trees and a kind of a running water. Keep an eye on kids if along because its too dangerous near the water as there is no safety boundary. I would not prefer to visit again that isolated jungle.
What a beautiful hidden gem. Lovely wooded park with a beautiful stream.
"I used to go for a walk there with my gramps and he always joked that it was haunted or filled with giant anaconda snakes. I was small back then so the tiny spiders I've seen felt like giant dino-sized tarantulas bruh

Jokes aside sometimes I just go back here to take a break. It's kind of hard to explain but the air feels/tastes WAY better than the air downtown or anywhere near cars.

Def recommend for a breather."
Cute little park.
"Most people stay on the main road of the Ruisseau de Montigny Nature Park. If you decide to do the same, you will most likely be disappointed by your visit. If you are slightly adventurous, preferably accompanied, you will get off the main path and start exploring the woods. This is where you will discover the real beauty of this park. The sound of water streams and the sight of beaver dams while still in a city park will enchant most visitors. A word of advice, wear light long pants and long sleeves and spray a generous amount of bug spray on exposed skin."
"The sound of the waterfall is relaxing, a lot of nature and friendly ducks"
Great place hidden! No parking so park on the street near entrance.
A real hidding spot inside Montreal.
So relaxing and peaceful
I enjoy our walks in this small park near our residence.
Wrong direction
"Small Woods with creek. No parking (but the street) and No services. Small walk, if you want to extend your walk you can go north to boul Gouin and continue around, or you can go south behind the Marie-Victorin College, but much less interesting than the nature-park itself."
A good park with great views
Nice country feel in urbain setting
Children's love searching for Po##mon. Great for outsiders.
"Nice park for hiking, walks, biking, also some geocaches can be found here."
There is no parking.but clean and beautiful.
Beautiful water.
"high way, railway, electricity towers and buildingsee around a walkway.  wouldn't call it a Parc.  not to say about the fast food garbage thrown around. .. looks more like a dumpster"
Nice place to relax

"No parking, no sign for the park enterance. just a unmaintained path in the woods. you have to make your way to see the little falls."
Lovely
Need more places like this
Loved it!
"Not actually a park, just for a walk"
Just a small path through the woods. Ok for a walk but not much else
Walking space in nature
A must see if in Montreal!
D√©paysement total en pleine ville!
Heureux parcours. V√©lo ou √† pied.
Nice quiet and calm will be returning

"Absolutely fantastic new park module and water games (although the city needs to shut it down sooner, it's motion detection auto starts and it's just wasting water right now). Super well located and close by. Love this park so much!"
"Great neighborhood park with playground, sports field, splash pad etc."
"Nice park for parents with kids. At night, if you're in the neighborhood, good spot for tansition in a date or just for a walk."
Ran in circles for a while (on purpose) and enjoyed their track field!
"Beautifully kept Parc with an arena, a soccer field, a football field, a running track, a Parc for kids and a kids pool."
Not so developed as other parcs
One of my favorite parks in Mtl.

Good parc
It's a cute park with fountains in the summer.  Excellent for families with kids.
Great water games for the kids.
Great deal to kids
Nice spot in Montreal to see Tulips.üå∑
Park of the strong men. A small spot to relax.
"Nice park,fields aren't the best"
Nice relaxing park to play with my daughter. Not to many people if you like it that way. There's a little outdoor kid pool also.
Nice Park with few amenities.
Big. Has a pool. The grass was not done when I went.
Beautiful place for families.free wifi
Horrible place for toddlers.
Little park along the Lachine canal. Parking space available. Sturdy picnick tables in the shade of trees. Busy bike track passing through. Nice place to have lunch and relax.
Nice quiet place to walk
"Lovely park that runs the length of the canal. There is a bike path that runs the length of it.

There is also a football and soccer field.

If you happen to wonder past the park on the bike path; you'll find yourself on a peninsula across from the lackshore.

Wheelchair accessible as well as reserved parking spots.

Definitely a nice place for a late afternoon stroll"
Bicycle and walking paths and many stop off places to rest etc. It follows the old Seaway Canal before the newer one opposite the Montreal Island.
Beautiful location
Wow
"As a foreigner, from Mexico, this park was an absolutely interesting place,  because you can practice ski, snowboard or just go down on a snow tub (I hope I said it correctly) and with prices not that high. The day we went there, past January 2020, it was snowing and had a blast there and if we go back to Montreal, we would gladly return to that park. They have a little coffe shop there, the menu is very limited but it it's cold you can have a nice cup of coffee to get warm."
We had a wonderful time. Excellent hills for sledding. A lot of fun and very convenient for its location.
"I really loved the place. Kids had a lot of fun.
It is small, but more than enough to have fun.
If you don't have your own sleds, you will have to book 24 hours in advance. Best thing: everything is FREE.
Parking is available and people there are very friendly.
Overall experience: definitely something you and your family will love."
"It's magical, callisthenics and basketball court with ping pong tables and a hill with nice sunsets? Do it"
"Love this park! Many activities all year long!!
Plus the doggy park it‚Äôs amazing! My puppy üê∂ loves it!"
What a great hidden gem in LaSalle! Will be back here regularly with the kids and the sled.
"If you stock in the city, best place to go for have a nice picnic and enjoy front water view. You can find a lot of spots around"
Big park. Nice hills if you want to go sledding. You can also reserve tubes which is really fun for kids
"It's not to crowded most importantly the washroom is clean, sport facilities.
They have two section of playground.
On summer time they have a big swimming pool ( I dont know if they will open this year Due to covid)
They have a lot of picnic table sorry you cant BBQ ( I dont know why)."
"Incredibly spacious park and very well equipped! I really appreciate how they have a calisthenic exercise section geared towards seniors from the residence nearby. Last winter the park hosted winter activities such as sledding, skiing, and snowboarding! There have been talks that the city will not be renewing the winter activities this year which is a real shame...for this reason I'm giving the venue 4 stars instead of 5."
"I go here for track workouts twice a week. There's also a nice selection of workout equipment, horseshoe pits and even ping pong tables"
Great park. Even has a workout area with pull up bars and other equipment for public use. The hill with the view is my favorite part
Very well organized and well maintained sledding place!
"Great spot!  If you want to save a trip up north....St. Saveur has setup a ski school for kids at Newman Hill. They have all the ski, boots and helmet rentals on-site. They also have Tubing (which you can rent) and tobaganning (bring your own).
Great way to kill a few hours."
Good place to go sledding with family. 3 wide snow slides of different length.
"This is a very nice local public park with a toboggan hill, fun for 4 seasons."
"A good place to slide and have fun with the kids in winter or enjoy the summer walking, playing soccer or beisball and swimming in the pool"
"Very low snow, so the sliding hill was all ice. With la Pente a Neige (St Sauveur) not returning this year because Ville Emard probably wanted more money, there is a major loss of winter activities options in the area."
Good toboggan hill with ski lessons on the south side. Has tubing available too.  Just missing a Poma on the toboggan side.
Omg I love it
"Clean and peaceful park that is well maintained by the city. Great sports fields, dog parks, swimming pool, and sledding during winter season. Recommend everyone to visit at least once!"
"Parc is nice. There's free and paid sliding in winter. It used to be all free but city decided to charge now to use it and left just a corner, the worst one for free ..."
great place for sliding and skating for the whole family!
Very fun! Bring the kid's
"During winter time, there has a nice snow ramp. It's perfect for snowboarding! For kids!"
Great park with lots of outdoor activities for kids and families
I live coming here during the winter to go sledding with the little ones
üëåüëåüëå nice park.... Good treking park for the calisthenics workout!!
Will be going regularly... It offers something to everyone.
"The pitch could be better maintained. Very uneven all around, thus making it hard to run and play."
Great place to bring the kids
The track and the football pitch need to be maintained a bit better but otherwise this park is amazing year round
Great place for snow sliding.
"Great place to bring your dog.
Just remember that some dogs can be aggressive so it is good to talk to other owner before releasing them from the leashes...
The park also have a soccer field, baseball field, gym and spaces dedicated only for children.
In the winter they use the mountain for slides. Very fun."
Great for winter activities with kids
"Not well known park, it's bigger than it looks. Nice place and with swimming pool."
Good park for working out outside
So much fun in winter!
We went to slide with all the family.
"Parc with so many sports installation available, everyone csn find an activity. However, makes it crowded at times :)"
nice play with childrenÔºÅ
Great place for the family
It's well light and not busy at night!
Beautiful place
Sweet Spot to toboggan
Over the years i went plenty times tobogganing down Newman mountain .what they did to it was disgraceful .totally ruined everything nowadays the mountain is divided into stages beginners and advanced then other half is for snow boarders totally lost its fun and feeling nope no more
"We went here to play some Disk Golf, there is an open disk golf course of 12 holes that anyone can play. The only issue is that many holes are near the borders of the park and a missed shot can send it over a fence. Other than the disk golf this park is quite impressive with baseball, track, slides, ice rink and some really nice hills which must be great in the winter."
Good place for soccer
Great sledding and hockey rink in the winter. Great public pool in the summer. Wonderful park for ages 4+ (including a puzzle for kids to solve). Chalet near the rink offers hot chocolate on the weekends.
"Incredibly welcoming park! Lots of improvements in the last few years!
Removing the fences was a very good idea! Now there are less bad elements hanging out breaking bottles and equipment!
The disk golf course upgrades are really good! It looks and plays much better thanks to this good work!"
"Love it, a lot of entertainment places."
"Easy to get parking, diversity of activities for children,  warm places."
Lots of activities here.
Went there during winter and their skiing mountain is so inviting. The place is very clean. The snow is so white. But the staff in the container van is not so friendly. I asked for some information about the Pente a Neige and one guy stopped me while I was talking to the other kid staff saying that the information is there everything on the website. Very disrespectful. Very lazy man I wasn't even talking to him. I was so disappointed lazy people like him are hired for this kind of job.
"Very good park for kids. This year, the administrator introduce some skate training here. But, it is not a good idea if you come to play there without snow, the ice is very dangerous."
Nice park but the city still has some landscaping and maintenance work that must be done
Has a few play structures for kids.. Skate park.. Soccer/football field. Track and field. Hockey rink in the winter.. And a big pool and splash pad. The pool can hold almost 1000 people.
"Nice, clean park. I wish more parks would have a disc golf course."
"Newly renovated park (2016). There's fun for everyone there. Kids parks, baseball, running track, disk golf, dog park, swimming pool and winter sliding door all ages."
Had a great time tubing. Beautiful view of downtown.
Kids loved the snow tubing hills. Want to take them back for the ski and snowboard lessons.
"A really great place for friends to unite or family to picnic. We played ball with friends and enjoyed this clean and well organized parc. Baseball, softball, frisbee golf, pool, volleyball, basketball, etc etc"
free tobogganing. just bring your own magic carpet. can't have more fun with it
Best place to have fun on winter
Fun place with bathrooms and locker rooms for skating rink.
"there is a skateparc wish is not so bad, also a new training section and more."
They have made a lot of new contributions to the parc. There is a new corner for people to do free hands exercises. In the winter there is a snowboard and sliding pathway.
"The pool is awesome, there is a 50 meters lane...not to busy, great parc to relax."
"A large park with many trees and varied play structures, recently upgraded.  There is a large circular track for jogging / biking and an outdoor swimming pool."
Great for family winter fun
Wow!
"Wonderful place to enjoy sliding, fun place"
Went there to slide on tubes. Ski and snowboarding classes for my son.. he loved it
Went sledding with the girls and we had a blast. It was taxing walking up the hell but oh so worth it
"Best snow sliding little hill in south-west Montreal, that is until they blocked a big part of it for skiing school, didn‚Äôt know they could do that"
Ok... during winter is a good place...need to go also in summer to check in....
"This is an awesome park, very big with playground, place for children, even a place for dogs separately."
"Soccer field, pool, snow gliding, baseball, hockey and Frisbee golf. Beautiful park in Ville-Emard. Spent so many days as a kid."
Great park lots of different types of fields and activities

Great for beginner ski school.
"Huge park with playgroung for all ages. Good place for jogging, biking, and swimming."
Nice place üëç
"Great place to bring kids to slide, it's free."
Beautiful experience

"Accessible, near metro Angrignon, nice place to hangout."
Went during Winter. My kids did some skiboarding and tube sliding.
"Nice relaxing park. Usually clean, except when it starts to get cold like this time of year."
The potential to be a great park is there but the lack of attention to it makes it just average
Something for all ages from summer to winter.
"Lots of stuff to do. Dog park, pool, hockey rink, soccer/football field and even 12 holes of disk golf."
Great place for tobogganing!

"Winter fun,"
"The park is located at the crossroad so near 2 streets, there isn t many games available for the kids and it wasn t very clean when we were there with the kids. It s empty most of the time so there isn t any interaction with other kids. But the swimming pool near the park deserve a 3 stars as it s a really nice and that make it up for the average parküòâ"
Good place
Great park
Quite and relaxing place.
Small playground perfect for age 5-8 years old.
Just a small park with swings and slides for kids.
Perfect for young children
"I wake up this this beautiful park everyday, feels a lot larger than it is - the giant trees create a nice atmosphere at one end, with a large kids park for kiddos of all ages alongside (young toddlers to tweens), a rec center, small though used in various contexts next to the large grassed area, with a short enclosure all around for multiple soccer games or the like. A small designated dog park, gravel only, minimal room for any dogs to run around - still gets somewhat used as tons of dog owners in the area so is useful just could be largely improved for both dogs and owners."
"Not too overcrowded,  has a small dog park and is a great neighborhood park."
Always nice for a short walk
"Now that winter is in full force, you can enjoy the simple outdoor rink. The building next to it is open to change into your skates or use the restroom."
Quiet.
"Located perfectly on on western border of NDG, this is a great park for everyone  - huge trees, some walking paths and just about something for everyone

There is a full football field (which transforms into a hockey rink in the winter - generally really nicely maintained Ice).

In the summer there are frequently extracurricular sports for kids in the evening

There's a full playground - modern and clean - as well as a dog park.

Lonely place to bring the family for picnic."
"Medium sized park in Western NDG, within walking distance of Montreal West. Lots of maturing trees makes this a verdant quiet place.

2 playgrounds and 3 sets of swings in the south end. Bathrooms/changing rooms in a chalet with an adjoining water fountain in the middle.

North of that is a soccer field that is turned into an outdoor ice rink during the winter.

Far northern tip has a fenced off dog park.

Supposedly we will be getting a Bixi station at the northern end within two years (source planned Bixi expansion map from CBC)"
"Great park in the west end of NDG. Lots of room for many activities. There is a big area for the kids to play on slides, swings, ladders, towers and more. Lots of benches and a few picnic tables. There are bathrooms but maybe not always open. At one end is dog park for our four legged family to run. In the summer there is a soccer field like area that turns into an ice rink in the winter months. Awesome place to just come and relax too."
"A great place to ice skate in the winter and nice and shady in the summer. A nice little dog park too, so bring your dogs there are always new people and dogs to meet..."
Not even a light over the dog park.
"Quiet, clean and fun! ^^"
Lots of fun in the shade.
I was at William Bowie Park( Patricia Park) to play hockey. I'm too old for the jungle gym.

It also got an open stage with a roof. Sometimes shows and dances are held there.
There's also a public bathroom behind the stage.
In winter times, there's an ice rink on the open field
Overall, very clean park."
It's amazing especially during autumn
"Nice park for family or friends gathering. Has a playground for children, a skating rink in winter  ."
Cool park with a nice flat area for some sports and activities... Floor is a little bit too slippery..
"No matter if it's Winter or Spring, this park is beautiful. Obviously, it is more appealing with a temperature that allows humans to be there at least one hour without problems, but nature has its beauty all the time. You can walk, take a sunbath or play p√©tanque! People from ""Universit√© de Montr√©al"" and the HEC, use to come at lunch time. Nice place!"
It is good place to play for kids and good to walk for adults. Also you can ride or learn a bicycle here. For children there are many swings for playing. And many benches for parents and adults to sit and take rest and keep an eye of their kids.In this park there is a fountains for kid‚Äôs playing and enjoy the water in the summer. It is always full of people. You will never be get bored here. I visit there usually.

"Nice parc with activities for kids of all ages. We went there, on a really beautiful day, at the beginning of spring and the grass and the trees had still their winter look.
Hope that they city will renovate (sand and repaint) the wooden table-benches.
Overall, both the kids and us would love to revisit."
"Three different play areas/playgrounds (one of them fully enclosed) splash pad, public grassy area, workout equipment, covered area. Great use of space."
Nice to do sports
Grew up in the area. Love this place and its atmosphere ‚ù§
"Very nice park. Has ability to accommodate kids of all ages as well as grown-ups. Small workout area, kids water park, bathroom facilities and covered area for shade, or in case of rain."
"You can do quite a lot in this park:
- vast picnic/relaxing grass area
- covered dance floor made of concrete
- lounging area with chairs
- kids playgrounds (3)
- wading pool and water splashing area
- indoor restroom with changing room capabilities
- ice-skating rink in the winter"
"They just redid the park and it looks great. A nicer layout, great places for children with a fenced in area for the younger ones, a water park and some open grass with a really nice monument. The Bixi station is also here so that adds some convenience also."
Great safe fenced in parks for children of all ages 3 different jungle gyms and a sprinkler! The only issue... over the summer was the big blue open top garbage bins all over the stretch of grass... they attracted a lot of wasps which made my experience less pleasant as I am allergic to bug bites and had to keep changing spots to sit down.
Great park .It has a big open field which is occupied most of the time.Many chairs to sit and enjoy the weather.A mini water park for kids and a calisthenic gym.
"Great place to take kids and enjoy a good time.
The washrooms could be cleaned up once in a while."

"Nice, clean quiet and very relaxing atmosphere for a good start on a Saturday morning...."
"Water fountains, savers there in hot weather"
Visited with my female friend. She loves the p√©tanque. We had a nice chat there. Stunning view of the Oratory.
Lots going on in this park - there's usually a dance class or family Zumba class going on when we pass by. Wading pool hours are short (10-4) but the splash pad is open otherwise. They have an outdoor workout area and three playgrounds for different ages. This neighborhood has plenty of friendly families from diverse cultures!
Nice place to cool down and  wifi available as well
3 different heights of pull up bars and has parallel bars. Not so crowded only some people use it.

"Beautifull park with two basketball court, two tennis court and football fiel. There is also a small kids parc with free parking!"
"Great place for soccer, football, baseball, sledding in the winter, and anything in between!"
"Big park with a few playgrounds and jungle gyms. Newly added basketball court among existing tennis, baseball and football/soccer fields."
Nice and safe place to play....
Such a lovely place to walk
Needs to be updated
lots of fun sliding!
"Nice park, but the stands are inadequate for watching games."
"Tobogan hill, Swimming pool, softball, football, soccer, tennis, basketball, kids playground, washroom/ changing room, outdoor skating."
So fun!!!!
Decent
Really cool park.
Great ice
Great park for kids
Great amenities.
Why isn't there a picture ?
"Hanging out across the street from Lenny‚Äôs old pad. This is the most Montr√©al of the smallest parks in the plateau. Everyone is here. It‚Äôs a good place to sneak a drink, better than the park at Rachel and St Laurent. The tile work by the fountain is nice, glad there‚Äôs some Portuguese charm coming through here. People will speak to you here, be warned ü§£"
"Very interesting part of Montreal, a lot of  street art üé® in the walls"
"This is a gorgeous park.  So reminiscent of parka in Portugal especially with the type of tile used.  We walked near it to visit Leonard Cohen's home during the Museum of Montreal Jewish tour called ""In the Shadow of the Mountain."".

Definitely worth a visit!"
"Nice environment, decent size, not too big enough for picnics in my opinion, neither a walk. Good place if you just want to sit down and relax around trees. Chill people around there too, only downside is that there's a main road (Saint Laurent Blvd) next to it, so the car can sometime be loud."
A good place to chill or to eat your lunch if you're in St. Laurent str. In summer there's lots of activities there.
"Parc du Portugal is the heart of little Portugal! Morning to evening, you'll find local couples and friends meeting to socialise and discuss daily events or football. The bandstand regularly has musicians playing and is often enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. During the summer months there are various events, festivals and yoga classes held in the park. Come here to soak up the local atmosphere, chat with friends or rest from a tour of the plateau's numerous murals closeby. Some can even be spotted directly from the park!"
Great place to sit n enjoy a moment
Great Parc to chill casually.
So cosy with plenty of benches. The lion fountain is so good in summer to wet your head under it.
Cute little park in the heart of Montr√©al. In the memory of Portuguese community
"What can I say, my friend and I grabbed some empanadas from up the road and came to this park to eat them... What a pleasant surprise, there were people picnicking and two guys arrived and pulled out their guitars and started playing and singing. Gotta love Montreal!"
"Beautiful hair salon, it feels like you are on vacation.
Everybody is very professional.
They offer you refreshments.
If you are not entirely satisfied with your hair, just tell them. They immediately fix things , as you want them.
I strongly recommend this salon!"
Cool park on St Laurent and Rachel.
"Cute little
Local park right in front of Leonard Cohens house!"
The parc is in need of a little bit of love. Broken bottles and garbage a bit all over the place. Not too appealing!!!
I cosy place to sit and enjoy
It was a good spot to visit. You can really get a Portuguese feel from this park.
What a beautiful park situated near Old Port and in the Mile End Area. It has to offer a retro vibe and vintage experience with the stores nearby.
"Great little park full of people
Lovely place for a quick break"
Lovely little park. Perfect for spending a sunny afternoon with a book or a friend
Love this park. Great spot to take your Ramadoss chicken take out to.
Small place and cosy place to chill and relax on the way home üëçüòÉ
This park has been in my life since I was born üòä my getaway when I wasn't allowed to go anywhere off my block. Good memories üòÅ
I like this park. Small but adorable ‚ò∫
Leonard cohen
Cute friendly park
Its nice but it seems all the parks in Mont Royal are nice thats a great qartier .
My friend was assaulted by a homeless woman here. Still a nice park.
The green grass is a nice relaxing spot.
Small working class park with some nice and not so expensive eateries around
"What a pleasant surprise to find a little bit of Portugal in Montreal. Only visitors to Portugal or Brasil are likely to appreciate it, but the park is paved with the same black and white stone motif you find in Lisbon and Rio."
Small spot with gazebo and benches to chill and relax.
A relaxing place where one can bisect a shopping spree and enjoy some of the many nearby takeout offerings.
Extremely pleasant Parc! Leonard Cohen home just across! Time to think about past present & future!
"Cute little parc, great to sit and read. Leonard Cohen house is facing this park and he spent many days sitting and writing here."
"beautiful park, the people in it seem v happy. great stop for someone visiting MURAL."
One Natas and in front of Leonard Cohen old appartment...you feel relax
Good vibes; most of the time
It is a nice place. But there is a lot of homeless people.
Nice place to chill and relax.  Live DJ and other events during summer.
"I love this parc, espacially when i can see Leonard Cohen house just accross the street."
Stopped to take a photo of my kid in this crazy snowstor..
Nice little spot pretty quiet and fun
"It's where I eat my lunch during lunch break. There's little boxes that like to chirp at a high frequency which is rather annoying, eh."
Great small park!
Beautiful place!
Nice small park
Portugal et Leonard Cohen
People were actually speaking Portuguese
Regular park in Montreal.
"Just a Square, nothing special..."
Nice spot to sit down in the area
Fun!!!!
In front of the house of Leonard Cohen
Nice place to sit
Nice place

Leonard Cohen's family home is on this park.
Run down messy. Homeless people sleeping in gazebo quite frequently.
It's okay!
Good food and service
J'adore
L√©onard Cohen abitait tout pr√®s sur Valli√®res et venait r√©guli√®rement dans le parc.
"Not a big park, few chairs to sit down, people walk there dogs there, seems to be used for young kids who play soccer there, sometimes they have a fruit market set up in the parking lot, that's pretty cool.."
Very nice for kids. Parking as well
Nice and big park.
Small park for kids with soccer fields and jungle gym.

Crowded but nice for the kids
Nice and relaxing place to spend the day with the family.
Worthy to visit
Very nice
I love this parc.
A good park but could do with a better sprinkler for the kids.
A lot of interesting structures for kids of all ages. My favorite Parc in lasalle.
I grew up with this park and it was the coolest park in 1979 to 1985 and it's still the coolest park ever
Way too many people but still well maintained
Summertime is a fun filled time for the kids.!
Lots of nice greenery
Enjoyable family park
It has lots of structures.
Good
Big playground

üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ
Beautiful ‚ù§
"Place to take a walk , or enjoy sunset with a wide open view."
Its an awesome area.
Great park
Our grandkids love this little park. Only thing missing is a slide.
"It is a small, clean park for children to play in the downtown neighborhood. Suitable for toddlers. It is good for evening walks with your little one. It has a swing, see-saw and some other things. Bonus: no dogs are allowed inside the park."
"Very little playground, we stubled upon walking the city. Few activities, but good to allow a toddler  to let the enegry out."
"Good playground, there is a climbing structure a seesaw and swings, as well as some pretend ride on horses."
Very clean
Kids friendly
"very well maintained, family friendly park"
Paso ratos muy agradables con mis nietas y son in olvidables Bonito lugar y tranquilo
"Small park in a quiet residential area and it's perfect for the kids. With our toddler playing in water, we will spend almost every weekend throughout summer!"
Great fenced in splash pad! The kids I work with loved it üí¶
A beautiful bit of green for people to relax in with friends and families.
AMAZING and bigger then I though
The park is perfectly adapted for all kind of people. It's extraordinary to see people's hospitality & love towards their work and up-bring towards a better perspective of humanity & togetherness. üëèüèΩ
Too bad there's no dog park. There's plenty of room for one :(
Fantastic family oriented safe clean friendly. Great for kids six and under.
"Lovely, clean park."
Has a lovely park for younguns and toddlers...nice picnic tables for a snack..wading pool...tiny ball hockey rink but who stole the nets tabernac...ping pong tables...soccer nets but what happened to the dog run?
Local park. Fairly clean. Wading pool for tots in the summer. Outdoor skating rinks in winter.
A good place for kids. There are two playgrounds for different age groups. Lots of  community activities during the summer.
Eh. Good parc. Depends what you want from it - usually crowded with children. There is a clear effort to make it more welcoming to the community.
"Quiet park to relax, play petanque, soccer, and skate or hockey during winter time."
Great park to bring your dog
A little empty  but quiet
"Dirty, very dirty"
Cool place to bring your dog !
Swings
my neighbourhood park
Great community park
clean and fun for the kids
Nice for relaxing
Large park with lots of things to do.
2 parks. Kids tiny splash pad.
Multi activity
Great city activities for kids!
Nice place for a little picnic
Nice little local local park. Kids love it.
Good
"Great small park that is very active!
Many activities offered for kids during the summer months.

It has been renovated over the last 5 years.
2016 a new soccer field
2017 a new water play area to be open in summer 2018"
"New soccer field with Turf instead of grass (no more mud puddles). Nice basketball court, with chain mesh (don't dunk or you could lose a finger)"
Superbe placeüëåüèæ
"This has seen many many remodeling through the years. This one is by far my favorite. Reminds me of Sasha's park. It's a perfect mix of accessible and climbing structures. Lots of interactive modules (music, sand). Parking is small but lots of street parking. Good place for sledding."
"Very nice park nicely renovated for kids
Just missing the drinkabke water machine to work and a washroom
Suprise even a security agent of la ville was there"
"They have transformed this park beautifully
Great for gathering and partying
Highly recommended"
So nice and relaxing park. Big willow trees under which u can lay down and relax. Swings are there too.
Nice place to go for a walk and some slides for the kids in the winter.
"Brand new park Just by the river, a lot for kids to do."
Nice for kids. But keep an eye on the little ones. Don't want nobody getting hurt
The trees will grow and it will get more comfortable. Bathroom installations would be nice.
The park needs more benches and needs to be cleaned. Too much garbage on the ground. People should start using the garbage cans around the park.
"This is an urban park that is well maintained and pleasant to visit. It is situated in what is called old Riviere-des-Prairies (RDP), which is a surprising little village at the east end of the island of Montreal. The park, as also that part of town, will be a pleasant surprise for those who visit because it challenges the concept of RDP being a ""suburban-style"" part of town. Worth discovering!"
Nice baseball field for atome or moustique level. Well maintained but there's no playground in that parc.
Vinny caps was here
"One of the crappiest places I have been in Quebec. Those 5 star reviews are completely misleading. Getting into the park you risk being run over by either cars or bikes. No designated pedestrian walkway. Very rocky shore, view of the Montreal industrial area, dirty, uneven green area where you can twist ankles, old and run down facilities, infernal noise from the highway next to it. To be avoided! Clearly used by junkies after dark."
"A perfect place to get relaxed in Longueuil! Lay on the river bank and listen to nature's music.
I love this place!
Free parking with easy access to the park.  Permission to barbecue.  Clean bathroom. Play ground for children. Lots of benches throughout the park.
Great place for gathering with family and friends, bicycling and jogging.
Visit this beautiful park once and you never forget it."
"Parc Marie Victorin is in my neighbourhood, a very nice park on the bank of Saint Lawrence River. Amazing view of Montreal. You can spend fun evenings, relax, read books or just watch the river flowing.
One of favourite spots on the south shore."
"great space and even with hot weather, we get cooled off from the river. Lots of big trees for shade and shelter from the rain."
Awesome.park. The paths on a bike are awesome as is the wildlife on display!)
"Great Park, feels like far away in the wilderness yet only 5 minutes drive from the Metro and a WOW view of Montreal and the St-Laurence River. I visit this park frequently one of my favorite places I noticed over the years that wildlife is becoming more abundant than ever, just last year I notice lynx tracks +  cub tracks along side of the river in the mud, the the feline paws were so larg that I thought it was the Eastern Puma making √† new come-back but still unsure about that last one, also there are sightings coyotes. There is lots of deer throughout the near by parks of the St-Laurence River. Just hope they will protect one of so many last areas like Park Marie-Victorin

Pictures of the new Normandie passerelle just before the 21h30 curfew, they have a 24h parking at the entrance of the Normandie bridge (passerelle) from Bord de l'eau street very super nice, it will lead you right into  Marie-Victorin park.

This bridge is about a year or so old replacing an older one that was really basic until in February of 2015 it got struck by a dumpster truck coming from the highway with his dumpster still up and destroying it on one side of the highway."
Beautiful scenery. Lots of place to relax away from everything and everhone. Great views of the big o!
Location is excellent. Has a big marina. A big parc for nature travelers. Nature of the parc is very good. Biking roads nicely done but to be very close to the highway makes it very uncomfortable. A noise barrier is essential to this parc.
"Very beautiful park!
Spending sunset time here is the best thing ever happen with me.
This place is really good for fishing as well, very good running and cycling track. So all at one place.
Go give it visit, you will love it."
"A nice park beside the river, it‚Äôs a place we need to visit in fall!"
It is an incredible and magical place ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice place with good views of the river but the road nearby is really noisy
"Nice park with a cute view of the water. Sadly very noisy because of the adjacent highway. Entrance was also filled with quite of bit of trash on the floor, with both trashcans full to the brim."
"Very nice place for biking, jogging, walking.
wasn't too much clean last week at the gate."
Nice view of the city especially at sunset
A lovely park!
A really beautiful and Nice place to rest and to have fun. And also an Amazing view for pictures. üòçüòçüíì
Lovely place to walk or ride.
Great day walk with the kids. Great views. Very peaceful and great parc and discoveries for kids
Quite a pleasant park! Will bring my family here more often! Very good view of Montreal across the river!
Great spot to watch the sunset.
Nice place to have family and friends fun
A bit too noisy for my taste.
Family friendly bicycle ride along the Saint-Lawrence river.
Could have some picnic tables and bbq areas. Maybe a better waterside clearing for the summer sunset. But for the south shore it's ok.
A beautiful park located at the bank of Saint Lawrence River
Great parc.
Good park.
Wonderful place to do Rollerblades or bike or just take a nice walk
"right on the water, a few lovely stone tables, nice for picnics."
Great place for a piknick. Lovely place for a walk.
Nice views of the city right at water level.  You can sit on the rocks at the waterfront or on the park benches. Watch the boats go by or the birds doing their own thing!
Very quiet place and so nice
Good bike path and great views of the city
Wonderful place
"Nice to take a walk, especially on sunset."
"This is such a nice park along the St-Lawrence river. Unfortunately it is a littered beyond belief, most of it residual from late night parties. There's also too many dogs off leash in the eastern wooded part of the park. Drug paraphernalia is also very present. Creepy sex offenders seem to enjoy the secluded areas as well as the parking lot. On the upside there's a great kids playground sheltered from the Sun by the shade of large trees."
A very big park by the river great for families to spend the afternoon. Could have more parking
Need to bring your repellent or be prepare to suffer!
It's a very big park in the middle of nowhere but there's nothing to do .there's no access to the water . but they do have washrooms but I would prefer a cave. The washrooms look like no one is careing for them.
Nice place to have a picnic üòä
Great for outdoors
"Okay to have a picnic, but the place is kind of dirty."
Nice spot
"Nice place to walk around
Love going here with my dog to run on the big open spaces
Clean"
"Cool park by the water. Ideal for bbq picnics with family. Children friendly.
Marina next to the park where you can see big boats.
Good fishing spot also."
Nice parc but very small and very close from hwy
Good park. It has some places to fish also.
"Very nice park. My kids love the playground, but if your going just for that it's a bit of a long walk from the parking lot."
"Love it! A nice stop for the kids, while cycling."
Nice and quiet place near river.
Nice walk by the river
"Between a highway and the St-Lawrence, this park is not the most serene place to spend time. The park itself is cleaned regularly but the adjacent trails are a dump."
Super!
Nice pique-nique table and beautifull shady parc for the kids
Great!
Good place to bbq & watch sunset
"Great view of montreal, pet friendly."
For peaceful walk and scenery this is it
Always come and hang out for a little while when I‚Äôm in town.
"If only they could clean the things more, a lot of spiders around :("
Amazing view
Beautiful
Cant wait for the construction to be over. It scares the local wildlife.
Quiet calm place near the water.
Great park for family activities!
Nice place üëå
Spectacular sceneries! Especially sunset!
lovely park next to the port
Nice view and clean
ICE IS GONE NOW YOU CAN WALK ALL AROUND
Love it
Very nice place

Nice Park camping RV
Needs major overhaul
Really beautiful park
üëå
Super Match Impact
Niece for walking
good
"Tr√®s agr√©able avec un seul b√©mol, les bancs situ√©s face au fleuve sont majoritairement en plein soleil."
C'est un endroit magnifique pour ce promener en familles faire du v√©lo il y a un parc pour les tout petits on peut y paniquer il y a une marina pour ceux qui ont des bateaux
Bien mais bruyant car longeant la route 132
Tr√®s jolie parc tr√®s propre merci la ville de Longueuil
J aime l endroit pour marcher
Juste wow ce parc....
Good park for what it is. Small but with a decent platground and next to a municipal pool.
"Nice, clean and big park for the kids play around üëçüëçüëç"
Park was renovated about a year ago. Really nice with great new installation. Was good before even better now. Highly recommend
Love sitting in this park  on the way   and back from Plaze Cote Vertu
Ok. Need more trees for more shade and a few more benches. Also the sidewalk going through it needs drainage b/c always full of wate when it rains or when snow melts hard to maneuver through to other side of park which leads to the mall.
Loved it as always! Very kid friendly park!
"It should be  place for kids, however adults smoking there many times can smell pot. Dangerous for small kids. Many kids riding bikes carelessly. I found another places to go Instead."
"Nice, little park"
I really got wondered to see childeren enjoying there must visit !!
Awesome in neighborhood.
I don't doesn't feel safe don't there
Great park and splash pad great for toddlers
Very beautiful parc!!
Small park but have enough equipments for children. Only two swings for infants and toddlers. Had swimming pool for kids opens during summer
Good place for refreshment.
Nice environment for children and parents.missing more equipment as usually very busy.
Awesome
"If you love in the area it's pretty convenient, clean."
The park itself it's very good and even there is a very interesting swing for two kids in the same time but it's always very very very crowded
"community pool in Ville St Laurent, with a shallow end for younger swimmers and a decent size deeper end for more experienced swimmers. There are always lifeguards on duty. The pool also has an adjoining kids sprinkler play area that also has a lifeguard. The swimming pool is heated but the kids area is not. The only downside is parking; there is no parking lot so you have to find something on the nearby streets."
Good parc for the kids and teenagers for the summer
Best place for kids
Could be very crowded at times
its a nice park with a nice swimming pool
"The lifeguards at this pool need training in respect . And so should the children who get dumped there by their oarebts.
The swim staff yell and blow their whistles at everything. The pool should have restrictions on how many people can be in the water at the same time and children under age of twelve should have parents with them. Too many kids are dumped there and the swim staff is put in a situation where they have to whistle and tell every 5 minutes. It is NOT a relaxed environment.
Of all the public pools this one is the worst. The staff in Dorval talk to the kids.
Here they yell at them.
All st-laurent pools should have  limits on occupancy. Children must have parental supervision.like the Library, these are public places, not free babysitting services."
I dont see where All the money for the revamping of the park actually went
Nice and clean place!
"Great park to play basketball, always nice people."
Lifeguards were amazing very kind and helpful
By far the best place ever
Good place for swimming for both kids and adults
Great park.
There is a nice heated pool
Nice pool
The beat public swimming pool.
Revamp is nice
Very relaxing
It is a place to go to swim
Good for families
"The park was clean,"
Nice place
Cool
Pleasant place
"diving area, adult area, kids area, sunbathing area, pool is great!"
good
A beutiful place
Relax!
Dirty
swimming pool is very busy in summer
"Small park. It's the access to the marina and curling club. There's access to the river. Some places to sit. And free parking. Popular place! Nearer the water, there's a small strip of land where you cab sit down and relax with a great view of Lac Deux Montagnes."
very nice place for relax front of the lake.
Great view during sunset
Small but nice place to enjoy voice of nature
Very lovely. During the sunset it can definitely get crowded but totally worth it.
Great chill out spot by the water :)
New tennis courts are great
Beautiful place.
Great place for sunset
Wow
Nice
Nice place for a walk with friends and family
Like it
Nice view
No grass just pebbles
"Belle endroit mais tr√®s bruyant autour, weedeater, tondeuse gazon,construction ect."
Beau parc en bordure de la rivi√®re des mile iles.
"Appreciate the green space and the added pier in front of the Navatorium.  However, I find that there are nicer spaces along the Verdun / LaSalle waterfront area.  Bonus: kids have access to a great playground."
"awsome historical site and georgeous overlook. I do wish the federal historical signs had more english, however."
"Very beautiful park. It's big and it's perfect for biking, jogging  doing picnic or BBQ"
Love the park no issues no trash anywhere can't complain at all. Let's thank the tax dollars.
"Situated along the river, lovely view within the city. Popular with cyclists which is great during the summer months."
This park was so much fun. We walked along the path until we got to the rapids. We sat and enjoyed a beautiful show by Mother Nature.
Nice place to x-country ski but it looks better green
"My favorite spot in Mtl! Huge park good for a walk, biking, skating, babercue, swim... Lot of parking spots (free - yey)."
Nice park lots of people.
"I absolutely love this park. Whether you are looking for a place to exercise, read, ride a bike, bring your children - this is the place. During the summer there are some facilities with water for the children -and adults, of course- to play. Some concerts also happen there during the warm period of the year in Montreal. Great for families and anyone who is looking for a peaceful place to enjoy the beautiful Montreal."
Lovely place for a BBQ!
Beautiful view of the rapids. Excellent riverside trails from downtown Verdun lead to this clearing.
Beautiful park.  Great for long walks alongside the water
"Greatest park in Montreal! Near the river banks. You can watch birds during the day, bats at night, snakes, ducks, muskrats, enjoy a long walk under the trees! Only in Verdun and Lasalle!"
"Absolutely a great parc along LaSalle blvd. For biking along a very busy bikepath. start I suggest, at Pine beach parking, or easier Lachine parking near 6th avenue Just going east of the bridge. Can bike on to old port or over to the southshore over tbe bridge to Longueil and boat back to old montreal 7$, and then back to your car in Lachine or further west to Dorval or Pointe Claire. Great parc and bike route."
Cool Free Wifi!
"Absolutely stunning landscape. The best in Montreal! Picnics, rides, and fishing possible. Free public swimming pool"
Walks here are peaceful and I love water so works out perfectly.
"Easy free parking in the street, biking lanes, space for sports, next to the river, amazing views, the place has almost everything. No washrooms around."
Beautiful....wished I lived here..my fiance has lived in Montreal over 30 years and she never knew about this location.  I see why so many people are drawn to Canada and Montreal. Unsurpassed beauty and the people who live there are also well educated and well groomed.
Very pleasant and beautiful park to spend some time with family and friends.
"Not so much a park as a bike path with grass on one side and water on the other.

There are public restrooms, however, at the moment, they are closed.

Probably not the best place to walk - there are a lot of bikers whome are rather impolite.

Wheelchair accessible and parking (Free)"
Beautiful rapids with a rock tub barrier to safely swim. We found a shrimp!
What a wonder.....wow
"Very nice area to sit and relax, seen lots of people bike riding, fishing and canoeing."
"Amazing location, especially during the winter you can cross country skate, wall or jog. There's a community which hosts events during winter probably in summer too!"
Very relaxing place to go on a Sunday! üëç
Beautiful and Blissful
Beautiful place
All green space along the river is gorgeous.
Great park.
"Two weeks earlier face to 2019, the ice is gone. Great place for fishing."
"The perfect place to unwind all year round even in the winter. You can take walks, picnic, play at the park, meet people. A must go to place in verdun"
"Wonderful place to walk, jog or bike near the St-Lawrence River by the rapids. Also easy to park nearby on LaSalle Blvd."
Beautiful park! Beautiful scenery!
Nice park along the Saint-Laurent river.
"Dizier
Archaeological traces in and around the Maison Nivard de Saint-Dizier in western Verdun demonstrate the presence of Aboriginal people in Verdun as early as 4,000 years ago.
Verdun had its origins in as an area known as C√¥te des Argoulets at the foot of the Lachine Rapids. It was initially a militarized area (argoulets meaning ""sharpshooters""), with concessions given to militiamen who agreed to guard the area against an Iroquois assault on the colony of Ville-Marie. In 1671, the Sulpician Order, lords of the Island of Montreal since 1663, granted the area (now the western part of Verdun) as a fief to Major Zacharie Dupuis, chief of the Montreal militia. He is believed to have named the area after his natal village of Saverdun in southwestern France. C√¥te des Argoulets was renamed C√¥te de Verdun shortly afterward.
He then donated his land to St. Marguerite Bourgeoys, founder of the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame, who in turn sold it to √âtienne Nivard de Saint-Dizier in 1769. The nuns' building, now called the Maison Nivard de Saint-Dizier, still exists.
Following the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701 between the French and the Iroquois, which reduced the military threat to settlers in the southwest of the island, farmers settled the area along Lower Lachine Road, now boulevard LaSalle. Around 1800, Chemin de la Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre (now rue de l'√âglise) was opened.The Canal de l'Aqueduc, now Verdun's northwestern boundary, was dug in 1854 to furnish Montreal with drinking water from the St. Lawrence.
In 1874, a group of local land-owners met in a farmhouse called Le Pavillon, located at the corner of Lower Lachine Road and Chemin de la Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre, and decided to found the village of Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre. Chartered by the government of Quebec, it became the municipality of Verdun the following year. Settlement had been hampered due to frequent flooding, but a dyke was built starting in 1896; its completion resulted in a population boom. The dyke itself became host to Verdun's popular Boardwalk, before land reclamation in the 70s led to the expansion of the waterfront park along the whole length of Verdun's riverbank.
The first √âglise Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs (now part of the school of the same name) was built in 1899, followed by a combined town hall, fire hall, and police station in 1908. The tramway also arrived in 1899, connecting Verdun to downtown. A larger √âglise Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs was built in 1914.
In 1881, the Montreal Hospital for the Insane was founded as a Protestant counterpart to the Catholic H√¥pital Saint-Jean-de-Dieu (now H√¥pital Louis-H.-Lafontaine) east of the city. It would be built on two farms, purchased in 1887 and 1907, in the western end of Verdun. Affiliated with McGill University in 1946, it was renamed the Douglas Hospital in 1965.[10] Today, not only is it one of Verdun's largest public institutions, but its campus is one of the borough's most important greenspaces.
Verdun became a town in 1907 and a city in 1912. Between 1911 and 1924 the population tripled and urbanization expanded rapidly ""westward"" (according to ""Montreal directions"" - actually due southward), and the farms were divided for residential use. The Moffat area west of rue Desmarchais was built in with ""plexes""‚Äîthe typical Montreal layered apartment‚Äîbetween 1920 and 1930,[11] and the Crawford Park area in the far west of the town was built starting in 1945, in a more suburban style unlike the orthogonal grid used in the rest of Verdun.[8] The Verdun Natatorium was built in 1930, the Verdun Hospital in 1932, and the Verdun Auditorium in 1938.
The city was chiefly (59% in 1931) English-speaking. According to historian Serge Durflinger, Verdun residents made a massive contribution to the Canadian war efforts in World War I and World War II, due to the many British immigrants living there who enthusiastically joined the Canadian armed forces."
great place to go walk and enjoy the river and all it's nature. get to even see geese up close
Is she really come check out this place...Don't just take my word for it
Had a lot of with friends. Wish they had bigger kayaks but still it was a lot of fun
I walk here every day.
Nice park for a little walk or picnic
Right near where i grew up big beautiful historical landmark gorgeous view scenery
"Very nice place to be especially in the mormings.Itis quiet there is lots of greenery the river the look outs a few areas for entertainment toilets which are opened from spring to the beginning of fall can be a busy place bike paths too and water fountains
Like I'd mentioned before I like going for my walk in the park early in the mornings the fact that it is quiet allows me to meditate reflect on beauty and creation.The jogers are also out.doing their thing.Lovely place for picnic sport event etc.also historical area nice place for a visit"
"Beautiful view on the river, large bike lane, picnic tables, basketball court and an historical house turned in a museum. Really a good place to bring your family."
Nice park. Over the summer a group of people meet there to teach how to dance Latin music (salsa & bachata).
you can see the sunset
I strongly recommend a visit to this place. It has one of the best bicycle tracks of Montreal. If you follow the track to the South most end you will be close to another amazing Park called Parc Rene Levesque.
Beautiful view of the St Lawrence River.
"Greenhouse is a nice resource if you live in the area. Walking paths along the water, there's always people swimming and fishing in the summer. Really nice park!"
Amazing nature spot.
Crazy cool little house is the oldest house in Quebec I forgot what year but it's in the early 1800s and it was incredible to see in person and actually touch something that's almost 200 years old and the fact that some one lived in it once upon a time just coneplelty blows my mind and it was in such an optimal location right on front of the rapids just south if it
"Multiple paths, breezy, clean. Bathrooms only open in summer, boooo!"
Clean and nice park. Needs better separation between walking path and bike path
Cool place for for kids and family for picnic.. sunday its a little busy. You get a great view from here. I didn't spend much time here but but i like the view point.

Good place to spend an evening
"Newly upgraded site, cool for short break in historical environment."
Great place to dance salsa in the summer. The restroom situation needs to be improved
"This park is beautiful and a good place to take pictures, for runners or to take a walk. There is a platform from where you can view the river and the landscape. La maison Nivard it is also a archeological site. You can bring your mascot here. People visit this park all year long."
Nice place for weekend with family and friends
Flowing river of saint Laurent
Good place to go running.  A path along the water and a huge amount of green space.
"Verdun bike path is the nicest path there is to use in Montreal. Flat, easy and so gorgeous. Always along side of St-Lawrence river, you can add to your bike ride a lot of km just by following the path, you can go to Lasalle, Dorval, Pointe-Claire all the way to Senneville. Really cool and safe."
"Nice riverside walk, bike, run, exercise and relax."
Absolutely NO PARKING. PAS STATIONMENT
Nice !!!
Good location for a family winter carnival.
"Beautiful no structure parc by the water. Doc, kayak rental, pool, mini cafe during summer."

It's a very dull place could take a little life
Situated in the back of a public housing project to serve the excercise needs of kids around the neighborhood..
Nice little park
First railway park.
"Nice park with skating during the winter, and local events.  Fun for kids.  Nice lunch-time walk."
"Beautiful part, nice skating rink but please maintain the ice so we can enjoy it injury-free!"
This park locked right on the corner of Du College metro. This park is quite nice and spacious. Can have a very relaxing time during the summer. For the Christmas they decorated the park. Looks really nice  during the night. Beaudet park is very clean. Grass and surrounding areas are very well maintained.
"Beautiful little park and a great place to relax despite being situated near the NW exit of DuCollege Metro station. Popular with Vanier students in summer. The war memorial and distinctive mural make it a unique and special place to visit all year round. Towards Christmas, the decorations are charming especially after fresh snowfall."
"Spring is coming, snow is melting, birds are chirping, all‚Äôs good."
Fantastic place for kids. With shop for drinks and food around
Iced trails for skating. Awesome place to bring kids to learn to skate.

has been empty most days!
"It's a nice place for walking around while enjoying the green colors of trees and ground, a park that represents very well its other name: Peace Park."
Very nice park
The park needs more garbage and recycling bins.
"In summer the piano and flowers add a nice touch, whereas in winter the temporary skating rink is a lot of fun. The whole neighbourhood manages to get something from this small but well placed and very accessible park. There is a water fountain but no permanent on site toilets. 2 minutes walk from Du College metro starion."
Beautiful park.people were skating ‚õ∏
Love the new skating rink!
Great park for a safe stroll at night. Bubble tea right across the street is amazing. Nicest girl that works there hands down! Every employee should be like this girl. Have a tea in the park. Clean and lights work well.
Fenomenal place. They even have a park long skate ring
Nice lightings in winters!!
Beautiful skating rank in winter
"It's actually quite a pretty park with nice tall trees. Simple but pretty, especially on a summer evening."
Very good
Beautiful place to chill and relax.
"Nice park close to a Boulevard with banks, small shops and restaurants.  But, as with all parks in this borough, NO DOGS ALLOWED.  It would be nice for city managers to consider changing this sad policy."
Excellent park... however people still smoke around the park which can be annoying...
From Dec to beginning of March there is an outdoor skating rink maintained by the city. Very pleasant little park.
Clean beautiful park. Lots of big trees. Lovely in winter. You can go skating.
Very pretty park. It's got an outdoor piano :)

Pleasant n calm. Nice spot to take lunch break.
Beautiful park with many places to sit and enjoy the outdoors

Once upon a time i came here to meet up with a friend. When i got there i found out my friend was actually Forest Gump
"Pretty quiet here, so a decent spot to relax. Nothing much to do most of the year (barely enough space to kick a ball around), but you can skate in winter, which is nice."
Awesome park with very interesting activities. I always have fun in them.
"I like to go to that beautiful little park for a walk. In winter there is a skate ring, with beautiful enlightenments. In summers the are often activities or special events. Closer to some apps where you can buy a snack or a drink."

Very nice place for winter skating.
"Beautiful park, nothing special."
Nice aireated park with a lot of squirrels!

"The week-end during dinner time it loaded of big group of people making  BBQ, it is less pleasant. But during the week it is really quiet. There are many table and bench, a work out area brand new, where some goes, so never really busy, you can do your fitness are your own paste. You can rent kayak to go on the LaPrairies river. There a small house with toillet. When the night  fall there is no light at all. So I dont recommend this place with sun. There are a nice park for the kid and walking the way around will make you pass inside the beautiful wood that is really old by the size of the trees. Go and enjoy."

Nice place for gathering near to the river. There is possibility of BBQ.
Beautiful park but it needs more picnic tables.
Great park for the family or simply to enjoy a bit of nature.

Great park for biking and fishing. Great scenery in the fall. Just he warned that there is a guy that has been hanging around the woods for years day and night. He's harmless though.
Nice and clean place with lots of shade and mosquitoes.
Great view on the river. Playground for the kids. Nice picnic spot. Bring bug repellent
"Lovely park with a mini forest, great view of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, playground, BBQs & picnic benches, my favorite giant tree next to the river (a cottonwood) & joins up with bike path. Only things missing are a dog park üê∂ & skating rink in winter.

Watch out though, the river is starting to flood the park due to spring thaw!"
"Beautiful park with a view on the river. You can rent a kayak to enjoy some time on the water.

My only complaint is that there is a lack of park toys for younger children."
Small park on the water with beautiful large and mature trees. Great sunset views. You can rent water sport equipment like kayaks and canoes.

Nice parc . kids enjoyed
Difficult to reach there with a charcoal grill and other stuff. Far from where we leave the car.
"When of the best parks in the area. Big and green. Great for pokemon go players, since it had many pokestop and gyms"
A nice place to get away from it all
"Wonderful place, the view of the river is an entire story."
"nice for a little walk or a jog, not much else to do though"
"Honestly this park is a free for all. Thinking of coming here on a summer day, think again! Smelly bbq fires litter the green spaces, cooking with smelly foods and the smell of petroleum bbq lighter fluid poisons the air you breathe. Guys fish on the river shores, doubt that's legal. And if you are white you will seriously feel out of place. Parking availability in this park is also inadequate."
Went on a kayaking tour from here.  Great time!
nice
"No bathrooms, I have no idea why...?"
Love the new training bars

beutiful
Like it
Nice park
"Clean, good for baby"
"The park has been updated over the last year. Its clean and in great condition. Kids had a great time. I would say appropriate for ages 2 to 12. No more basketball nets. The swings and playground is great for children. Also the trees provide a nice shaded area to cool off when necessary.

If you find this review helpful, feel free to give it a thumbs up."
"Queit, recently rebuilt.... kids like it. Only down side...to much attention just because is close to city hall...other parcs around are suffering because of this..."
Nice installations
Great place to play inüòâ
Great spot.
Nice park for the kids.
Very nice upgraded
"Was in Montreal for a week of Just For Laughs festival and visited this place almost nightly. Great venue for a comedy show, it held a few thousand people max and the sound was clear and crisp. The area was surrounded with many stations for children of all ages to keep everyone busy. Not sure if it's always like this, or because the JFL's was in town, regardless it was a beautiful place to enjoy our evenings."
Amazing arena. There is always some kind of activities going on. It gets busy during the summer.
"Montr√©al en Lumiere is a fun festival for families, visitors, and locals. It has entertainment for children, food and drinks for foodies, a ferris wheel, a zip line!, live show and music. La nuit Blanche is Saturday, goes till 3 am!"
"I was impressed by the park not because of its fancy views, but the friendly facilities. There are clean washrooms, picnic tables, children's playground fit for a wide range of ages. It's quiet and nice."
Best restaurant ever ate very good place
For children and school only
"Great place to walk around with kids, lots of life, very accessible."
Nice little part
Good
Very good
Nice place
Nice place
"This park is a very great place to hang out with your friends and family. There are two volleyball court available to the public along with a water ""park"" with washroom accessible to anyone in the park. The water park is a great place to get cold water after a hot session of volleyball. Also, there are a couple of picnic table in place throughout the park. The park is right beside a river with great scenery into it.

The volleyball court is a beach style sport. The sand tends to get burning hot when the sun is up. Therefore, it would be wise to plan a volleyball session during the afternoon when the sun is less prominent.

Also, there are very few parking in the park's parking. Although street parking is very accessible. However, depending on the day you are going, it would be essential to check for parking signs."
Best place to be with family. Ample space for kids to play..had a great time
Nice park along the water.
Heart breaking experience. Can't do bbq anymore. Last year was  so wonderful.
"Best park seen till date in Montreal.
Its put of at bank of river is making it best.

If you going with children, they will enjoy more than any ordinary park because of shower games they are amazing.
Go with ready swim suits in case you love shower games.
Lot of place for families to have barbecue outings.
Games like beach hollyball, cycling tracks, fishing makes it even more interesting.
I saw people doing fishing üé£ as well.
Feeding goose is allowed I think, as I see lot so happening around.

It was super crowded."
Beautiful park by the water. A hidden gem. The only thing is there are not enough parking spots...
Very well maintained parküëåüëå
"Nice place, but events was there when we went. All kids activity was there"
Great place to walk. Lots of little spots to meditate in. Parking is often packed  so  get there early.
"Eritrean Canadian Cultural Community  maintained a very well organized BBQ annual gathering at Raimbault Park for the second consecutive year.  Very clean well maintained park, with a very neat waterfront and water park for kids. Love it."
"Kids friendly
Beach volley
Barbecue
Fishing
Walking & cycling
lots of Animals like Ducks ,Geese ,Squirrels,tortoises,beavers and raccoons
But Visiters are very careless about Garbage disposal"
"Very good park. Small place but has water games for children, play area, beach volleyball and it is water front."
Went there the morning of a beautiful automne day. Spent some good minutes taking photos of the gooses and duck with the reflection of the orange trees on the water. üòã
"Very very perfect park It has a water park for kids with lots of sprinklers and fireplaces with seating areas.Park goes through renovations  we enjoyed every minute of our visit and can made Barbecue..
I loved it so much"
"BBQ area, beach volleyball, water fountains, playground, toilets, bicycle path, great view right on the river.

Cons: very small parking; only 2 tables under the tent"
"A small park with quite good facilities for kids (summer only). There is a circular trail, with views opening onto the Prairies River. The only downside is the large volume of trash left by less considerate picnickers and ""anglers"". A variety of wildlife can be seen for those with the patience to wait at the waterside, including turtles, loons, squirrels, marmots, kingfisher, geese, ducks and overgrown koi carp. Busy on the weekends, in summer a grill spot should be grabbed as early as possible. Covered area for bad weather, easy paths, and relative isolation will please most. Please ensure to bring a bag for trash if picnicking. I am getting tired of filling an entire garbage bag every time I visit."
"It is located in Montreal. It is a nice park. Playground for kids & children. Water park for summer. Volleyball playground.

Benches in the park. As far I remember it is allowed to make BBQ there.

And sometimes people go to river side to fishing.

There is walking route & cycling route also."
"It‚Äôs nice park for barbecue party , fishing,beach volleyball,cycling ,walking ,kids friendly and animal watching (squirrels,Geese,Ducks,Raccoons and beavers )"

Nice place for a walk by water
Very nice park to go with your young ones they even have a beach volleyball üèê court . Which I think is super cool üòé
Nice place for a walk but I wished it has a longer path...
Great place to go get de-stressed...
Its Absolutely Gorgeous...
Clean good to drive  bicycle
"It is very family friendly park, partially on the water. Was super crowded on this sunday June 14th, 2020, there was a cloud of BBQ smoke üòÅ. Very nice for a walk and you can also see the geese and ducks. Overall, I would go again üòä. There is an actual bathroom there and no door so only bathroom door, clean and soap was full so you can actually wash your hand and water is hand free. Parking is small so you will need to find parking in the adjacent streets."
A wonderful family place for children and adults
Good place in Montreal to relax and have gathering with the friends with a BBQ
It was a beautiful day.
Such a beautiful place. Amazing views ü§©
Water park for kids plus all the games in the sand... Volley ball etc. Nice view of the river
Park goes through renovations yet we still enjoyed every minute of our visit. It has a water park for kids with lots of sprinklers and few fireplaces with seating areas. Feed ducks if you like that (not sure if it is allowed) and literally touch the water. Stars for cleanliness of the park.
"Nice big park with water fun. Only negative,  not enough parking space."
"Peaceful place, very additive and many activities to come back,üåûüòÑüö¥"
"It's got everything, wildlife, biking, walking, playground, water park, and finding parking isn't too bad. Lots of space."
"My boyfriend took me fishing here and I caught my first fish. Now we‚Äôre married.

Lovely park. Great for running, walking, enjoying the water, being in love."
Nice stop on the bike path.
A beautiful photo-op on the bridge
"Visited the park this Sunday (May 24th), beautiful view of the water but happened to have lost a family heirloom while at the park. No contact number seems to be listed, would anyone happen to know whether there is a lost and found or any kind of office that I could contact for the park?"
Very peaceful place go early morning you will love it
A perfect community place for each and any  family-rejuvenation
Wow. Nice park
Beautiful park and amazing fall colors
Nice parc but it is always full of people
Beautiful nature with people having fun from all around the world
"The park was undergoing some maintenance when I visited. The toilets were closed and the splash pad was also not functional. They could have done a better job informing the public about this.
The location is good though, and can be a nice place for doing BBQ in summers once the park is fully operational."
Beautiful
"Great time with nature, water and ducks, views are really calming"
very crowdy specially splash pad.  very risky  to prevent COVID-19.
"It's a park, right up the water, very nice"
"Nice enough spot but it is a social distancing nightmare, if you care about that sort of thing."
Nice
There is a good playground for children under the age of eight and a place to play in the water. There's a barbecue and a toilet. a good place for family picnics.
"We did enjoy our time there. There is √† place for every thing. BBQ, Kids play ground, stunning view almost from every corner."
"Small Park, barbecue allow it, a lot of Arabic community"
Big park by the water. Ideal for children.
Amazing place for family
A lot of people come here during the summer for family barbecues. Although beware of rising waters during spring...
"I love this park, you can bike to it using the bike path on Gouin and then bike through it, relax, look at the water and the birds in complete tranquility, i bike there almost every week!"
I love everything about this park. It's right next to the river so the ambiance is great. What's better is that you can do BBQ. There is a special zone for that. You have some tables with chairs but be quick because they are gone fast of you are not early. They have a beach volleyball zone and also a park for the kids. I would say it's my fav park in Montreal. Not too crowded and exclusive in a sense.
Great place to relax. It's quite and has great scenery.
"Quiet strolls near the water, picnic area and many ducks and baby ducklings to watch near  the sandy area by the river"
Nice park for the kids. In the summer it has a water park section.
"Nice secluded parc next to the water.
There is a picnic area, a kid play ground and a small but nice waterparc.
This whole area have been rebuild maybe 2 years ago but apparently planning was not done well enough, the parc is now fenced, under construction for the summer until August I've heard."
"By the water, with ducks & goose. BBQ stations, picnic tables & water games for kids in the summer. Bicycle paths & play park... etc"
Nice park with kids playground. Lots of bees though in the BBQ area. For the bees wouldn't go back
"One of my favourite parks to go to. Nice scenery and wildlife. Be careful on the paths, the cyclists tend to be very aggressive."
Very beautiful park in tiny space. Autumn colors are awesome there.
"Great park, recent renovations made it even better."
It was amazing
"Nice park by river drive with kids play area and courts for different games., good place for a weekend outing with family"
Very nice picnic spot
Very beautiful place to make BBQ
"Good park with lots of room. There's a great bike path that goes through it. It's usually very crowded however with lots of young children and inattentive parents. It's ok to let your kids explore, but not to let them throw rocks at the ducks and geese."
"very beautiful park, there is a  bbq area. it is very close to the river. nice views but be careful with kids. there is a very nice playground with music intruments! my little one love it! there is washrooms and water fountain and 2 beach volleyball field!!!"

Beautiful clean and quite ! amazing for a nice walk.

Very good

Quiet place to rest with lots of ducks squirrels and geese
Great for morning jogging and BBQ. Great volleyball court with sand.
Beautiful park but not enough parking
Great relaxing parc
Great park
"There's place for everything, and it's right next to the river!"
One of the best parc in mtl to do BBQ.
Beutiful place
Nice views but a bit dirty
"This is the poster child park that demonstrates how Montreal's civil servants can let a picturesque park nestled by the river turn into the most disgusting place on earth. A porta-potty overflowing with poop that smells bad 50 feet around. There was poop in the urinal, the floor and each side of the seat. I couldn't stay long enough to take a picture. Its located next to the BBQ area where it looks like trash is picked up once a year. Happy 375th bday Montreal... This is truly shameful as it is truly a beautiful location for a city park by the river..."
Lovely park next to the water
Ok
Amaizing place for families
Took my wedding pictures here 33+yrs. ago!ü§óüòÑ

Excellent merci Valarie plante pour le jeux eau
A lovely park. Trails are easy and flat. Rather short (about 3 km each) but you can combine them for a longer hike. There is some fun bridges through the forest and even a fun view of the river on the peninsula trail.
It's a nice place and very well indicated. Wear some bug repellent.. I got quite a few bites from my visit. You must pay your parking for either 2 hours or full day ($9 something)
Love this gem of nature nicely tucked on our island. It's a bit hidden away and that's what makes it great. It's quiet and not overly crowded. Walks are decently long and most of the time you forget that you are in Montr√©al.
Great place for a walk! Nice setup. Expensive parking fee though. I'm park in the residential sector next time.
"Excellent park for walking, running, biking, bird watching and nature, excellent roads, bridges, walkways. I love this place & the family ‚ù§"
"Excellent place to go for a walk & play. Kids parc, water fountains at summer. Beautiful nature. Less crowded in gentle neighborhood in there."
"Another nice park on the West Island .
Big enough to enjoy a good walk  , ride with the bike . In winter it is suitable for skiing,  snow shoeing or just doing a walk through the woods.
Very calming."
"Very nice - there were a lot of ducks which made it a fun family place. There are also long walking trails, and a river."
"Beautiful park wether for a walk or activities. Enchanting scenery after a snowstorm. Can also do cross country, snowshoeing here."
"This park is an incredible find for anyone who loves to immerse themselves in nature. The trails are simple to walk and extremely enjoyable. From elevated platforms to open field to Japanese inspired garden infrastructure, there is something for everyone to enjoy. If you want a serene environment and peaceful time to yourself, do yourself a favor and visit."
"I love the biodiversity, and amount of trails for walking and winter sports. The highway noise the only detraction in this wonderful park.

The new boardwalks are beautiful, and worth a specific visit."
"We find it a very busy park with lots fast cyclists. My dogs are not fond of them. We also find the ¬´¬†passerelle japonais¬†¬ª beautiful and interesting, but the walking path of it is not meant for our dogs‚Äô paws üêæ , as the grates are too large, be very careful if you are coming with dogs. It‚Äôs nice to have a beautiful and dog friendly park in the area!"
"It is beautiful with lots of seating and picnic area for great gathering and a BBQ
U can also find little animals roaming around the park
Parking is available at alittle cost
Worth it"
"Perfect for that ""hike in the woods"" feeling. Trails, small and large, well majntained with ample parking and picnic area. Bridges and rivulets puntuate your journey and educational signs teach you about the surrounding wildlife. Park accessible in winter with trails for walking, snowshooing, and crosscountry skiing."
It was a beautiful walk minus some people not following rules and letting their dog off leash
"Very beautiful park, you will feel as you are in the middle of forest.
A lot of trees
Not suitable for patries or social events, its more to walk and observe the beauty of nature."
Nice calm park with many trails for pedestrians and bikers. It is also a great spot to go cross-country skiing on the island of Montreal. Recommend going there about 1 hour before sunset as there is less people at that time.
"It's a nice urban park for both cyclists and pedestrians, good times to have here, well worth the detour."
"It's quiet and nice, but full of mosquitoes. It's a cute place but nothing too outstanding."
"Nice place at where can listen the silent voice of nature in Montreal. Also, you can see the people doing skating....."
Great escape from the heat and noise. My favorite place in the West-Island Montreal.
"Two tobogan hills popular with kids and adults ! 5 Km of Snow-shoe trail. 10 Km of Cross-country trail. Equipment rental available. Free parking on street in front of L'Oreal Kids. Summer is lovely, too !"
Excellent Park. Very good place for picnics and biking. Very pleasant.
Love it... Enjoyed it. I recommend it to all
I like this place imagine a real live forest right in my own back yard. This is a great place to get away from it all and avoid big crowds. There is nice wild life to enjoy untouched great selections of wild plants and flowers  as well. Great enjoyment for the whole family.
"Very clean and well kept trails. Smells of pot, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars"
"Went in the winter for cross country skiing and it exceeded my expectations. Paths were really fun for a beginner like me, but they also had harder paths for intermediate skiers. Scenery was amazing and the staff at the rentals were very nice and friendly. 10/10 winter experience!"
"It was nice, slightly crowded. Would have be nice to cross country ski there but there's lots of hikers so you wouldn't be able to go for long uninterrupted bursts (maybe go really early)"
"Nice trails for ski, snowshoes and walking with the whole family. Great snow hill to slide on too!"
Wonderful place. I go there  often. Very nice
Great walking paths. Just a little crowded with groups enjoying the sunshine.
Very nice place
"Great nature park to escape the city and find yourself surrounded by nature. Extremely popular, especially during holidays"
"Beautiful trails, well maintained but some cyclists are going to trails they shouldn't and some don't even slow downs"
My place for a good walk in nature open all year long
I went there to try crosscountry skiing and it was really worth while. The paths are clean and nice. I reccomend.
"Beautiful trails to walk through.  Very well organized with maps at every junctions.  Paths are large and well maintained.  Great place to relax, take the kids to explore, go for a bike ride...

You can picnic at the chalet and they have restrooms.  They also offer snacks at the chalet.

My only complaint is the interactive displays are all in French only.  This has no impact on me, but I'm more concerned for visitors/tourists."
"It's a huge park for waking, skiing and snowshoeing in winter. It's suitable for adults and kids."
"This park is great for cross country skiing, they provide daily updates on snow conditions."
"Really nice park that allows many activities such as biking, snowshoeing, walking. If you are a walker like me, you can park on the side of the street & not at the main entrance and walk all the way to the water front. There's also a sitting area with picnic tables."
The flavor of up north right in ddo!
Beautiful park! It's very big with lots to see!
Amazing natural park! No need to go far for a breath of fresh air.
Great place to unwind and for a nature walk_run. Links to Riviere des Prairies.
"Nice, easy walking and cross country skiing trails."
"What a shame that anyone would have so little consideration or respect for the park - and the people who use it.
There's littering and then there's
littering !   This is litter we do not want to see !  And don't get me started on physical distancing.  Arrogant selfishness is alive and well."
First time to this park. It is beautiful. And big and quiet. Can walk forever. I was with my dog  Watch out for the moskistos.
"The site is beautiful and vast. It's a beautiful walk in nature and the squirrels are active and inquisitive. The only downside is that parking is horrible. There seems to be a parking lot that they closed, maybe due to Covid, and the main parking is overflowing."
I love walking these woods with my kids. My preference is to park at the Chalet des Champs. It has lots of benches for picnicking and it's a short walk to the bridge over the stream that my kids like exploring.
One of the best urban parks I've been to! A great place for a walk or ride on bike! Squirrels and chipmunks running around! üêøüêæüê¶
So close to home yet feels like up North. Wow
I didn't know this place until I saw a friend post it and it's close. Very calm and good place to get in touch with nature. Open for biking and walking during summer and available even winter.
"It's a nice park but a bit close to the highway, you can hear cars a lot in some areas."
Feels like your in the middle of the woods just right outside of DDO
Nice place. Have bit crowded in covid times
Great place to enjoy the nature in MTL
We went to see the what remains of the fire
"One of my favorite parks!!!
It's a really big park, you can hike or just sit and enjoy the nature around you.
A great place to bring your partner or family for a nice sunny day in the park!"
Nice and relaxing to get some nature time in. Walk run or ski.
"Beatiful place,  I want to go back!!"
Nice place to hike and picnic!
Lots of bikes and a bit crowded but nice place for a socially distanced walk
A little walk outside.
Beautiful park for small hike in Autumn
Nice walk not hard at all.
"They don‚Äôt take care of the forest, it‚Äôs difficult to walk. It‚Äôs just ok"
"Awesome park,  a lot of places to visit and a lot of activities possible....like , bicycle, jogging, walking, dog friendly, picnic or just simply relaxing.  also in winter, mount sliding, ski and so on..."
We had fun walking through the park
amazing park especially in winter so good walk around the lake
Too many cyclists driving too fast and crowding the pedestrians. Lots of mud on the paths. Lots of poison ivy. I will not go back. Rigaud and Ile bizard both have way better hiking.
Great place for a walk in natuer
The northern side of the blue trail was much less busy and more peaceful than the southern side.
A great walk for winter. Outdoors during a pandemic.
Really relaxing area.
"Lots of trails, wide paths and plenty of parking on Sunnybrook."
"Great place in the west island, i went there with my bicycle. I give it 4 star because the map is confusing and easy to get lost. I thought i was the only one having hard time understanding the map but i also saw couple other families figuring out were exactly they were. Other than that Park is excellent and well maintained! Its a must visit. Its Open during Covid-19 just make sure their opening times on google !"
"A nice quiet day in the park. I've live in Montreal for over 20 years and never went to this park before. Should be great to live close to such a nice park for walk or runs. It's 9$ to park for more than 2hours, unless you know another entrance from accross the park, then you can park on the residential streets. We appreciated the Japanese walkway and how well covered the biggest part of the park was. Some small  educational part of the park also seems to still be working. Takes about 3 hours do do the entire park, and will do it again one day soon!"
"Beautiful wooded area, well maintained and very clean. We had a lovely day there!"
"Tranquil place to hang out in summer or winter.
Picnic areas, good cross country skiing, small tobagganin hill. I'm taking away one star due to the parking fees...7$/hr"
The 13 runs right over this park and the noise dominates all the trails. There are also several ugly.industrial buildings in the champs zone. Overall not worth a detour.
"Very nice place for both shorter or longer walks, clean trails, well identify."
"If the idea of walking in the woods with the sound of the highway in the background is a peaceful one for you, then this is your spot."
Very good. Very colorful in Fall. Nice trails. Good facilities. Large enough to accommodate any desire.
Quite nice for being a local walk and gives you an out-of-city feel
"Great place for a walk, though between June and September the mosquitoes are voracious.

You can spot all sorts of animals - over the years I've seen chipmunks, meadow voles, squirrels, groundhogs, beavers, ducks, geese, raccoons, fox, coyote, grass snakes, wild turkey, rabbits, skunks, moles, rabbits,  grey owls and a wide assortment of birds."
"Could be a decent park but the highway noise is incessant and very annoying, and omnipresent on all the trails. Much better parks in Lachine, Verdun and LaSalle."
"Super nice park, if you have a mid range mountain bike you'd have tons of fun"
We visit there in the fall which was marvellous. There are some walking and cycling trails there with lots of sigh seeing  stations for birdwatching and some cottages which have recreation facilities
A superb forest walk with a few section of impressive elevated walkways.
"Nice place for hiking, picnic, BBQ and cycling"
"Bike rides, Hiking or just a good ol' ""get together"" with friends and family for picnic or BBQ, you can do all of this in the park. Dogs are allowed as well."
This park is great for both bikes and walks. The park is big with alot of paths. It's fun getting lost in there lol. There's maps so don't worry. Good terrain lovely greens in the summer and plenty of room for winter activities. Great place to spend some time
"Great cross country skiing. You can even bring your dog on the trails! Seeing it's so popular, it tends to get crowded in the afternoon on weekends. Best to go during the week or early in the morning."
"Great park not far from downtown, not very crowded, lots of nice biking and hiking trails"
Nice nature park right in the city!
Beautiful variety of trails.
Great park to visit that doesn't feel in the middle of the city
What a beautiful park for a hike. Many beautiful sceneries. Trail is quite long so prepare to follow directions!
Great for walking
"Small park, nice for short walks. In the winter many paths are closed. Open paths are good for cross country skiing and walking."
"Very beautiful, truly enjoyed the many kms of clean trails."
Good hour walk that could end up if a fresh water lake and nice view
Great place for a picnic!!
nice trail place
"This place is really  Cool, Peaceful, Calm and Greeny. Nice place for biking with bike lane."
"Nice place to walk, but not really more to do. You may do camping and bicycling also"
Nice trails through the forest. Peaceful and quiet. Parking is a little expensive for the suburbs though.
Very nice hike very child friendly
Excellent park for the whole familyüòÅ
"Great park, just wish trails were longer"
Very nice place for raquete
Lots of cute critters and beautiful simple foliage when we went.
Lots of nice paths.
"Too bad the elevated walkways were under construction, but lots to see in this park. Seems great for repeat trips, lots of trails to explore"
Nice park with many trails..well marked directions
"Beautiful and peaceful park, with some cozy corners, a good location for birthdays!"
That's a very popular destination and a green lung of the west island.
"Living in the city is great , but have km's of amazing forest trails is definitely a positive. Trails are maintained all year round and just a wonderful place for a stroll"
Excellent sliding walking skiing snowshoeing
One of the best park in Montreal.
"This century-old forest of black maples is home to a diversified ecosystem. you can see several species of plants and animals. Wildflowers carpet the forest floor in spring, the Bertrand stream teems with a rich aquatic fauna and birds sing undisturbed. When snow covers the ground, the park becomes a meeting place for winter loves. The 158-hectare playing field features cross-country skiing, hiking and snowshoeing trails, as well as two sledding mounds. The park‚Äôs winter landscape is sure to delight visitors."
Great place for the whole family and forget that you are still in the city.
Nice quiet place to escape the City.
Good place for patin and ski
Super nice place for a stroll in any season. Close to the city. Convenient. Clean. Bring insect repellant in the warm months.
Great place to cross country ski
Beautiful place üòç if you love nature
Scenic Nature with beautiful trails and picnic spots
üëç
Great outdoors
Its simply beautiful!
All season nature and recreation place for all ages.
"It's a beautiful place to cross country ski or snowshoe or even just go for a winter walk.  If you're not skiing, stay off the ski tracks please."
"What a beautiful park, the lady at the information center was so nice and knowledgeable."
Great place
"This park is a gem in the West side on Montreal. Located at the edge of an industrial area, it guards a beautiful and peaceful forest great for running or just or hiking.  On its West side has a beautiful forest where you are sour rounded by big trees and maples while you are walking in a gravel path. On the East side is more open and if you are a train lover, you can see the local train pass very close to you several times a day. If you are a runner, you can easily do 8kms on their paths and maybe 10kms connecting all together. By the way, in winter it‚Äôs algo a good place to do cross-country ski, and also snowshoeing, specially with kids."
"Great place to walk around, jog or even bike around."
It's so fun
"Great place for a walk , jog or bike ride."
"Safe, Beautiful, Peace, Hiking... Adjectives are short defining this place. You can spend good family time. Hearing birds n enjoying nature. There are small small wooden bridges inside as well as a restaurant n help desk inside."
"We love it, my wife and I often take a walk there and enjoy the nature. Too many different trails, easy to difficult."
In all its glory in the fall season
Wild forest oasis in the middle of busiest part of Montreal.
Nice trails through the forest.
Very beautiful trails and picnic spaces
Well maintained and very pleasant hiking and biking nature trail.  Peaceful lots of trees some birds and small wildlife like squirrels.
Find peace of mind visit the nature park of the Bois de lisse with your loved ones you will not be disappointed.
Was a bit run down as compared to Mont Royal or Lachine.
Enjoyable trails.
A great park. Very well maintained winter and summer alike
Quiet and well maintained trails.
Beautiful park for pictures of nature and hiking or walking!
Good place to walk.
Perfect ski trail
Peaceful place and also you can ride tour bike
Great place to learn cross-country skiing. My son loves it.
Love these trails
Beautiful park ... ideal to go with a stroller and to have a picnic
"So beautiful in the and winter
You could see the rabbits, stream, take a beautiful refreshing hike and lots more"
"A park crossed by a highway, a railroad and a street and tottaly flooded at the time I was there. You can listen though to the birds chirping... on the background of the highway noises. That's something special! A plus would be the dogs allowed in the park in leashes which are barking at you. One of the rare parks I would not recommend in Great Montreal area in any season. There are many other much better."
Love this place !
"Nice place, not too busy.  The only downside is the fact that a major highway runs in the middle of the park.  Nice getaway to the country in the city."
Nice and peaceful place without getting out from Montreal island
Nice and clean place
Nice easy and short trail
"Great place for snow shoeing, cross country skiing and walking. Some of the trails are closed and the markings are hard to figure out in certain places. It's a great place to get a breath of fresh air. The workers are kind and helpful, the trails are free to use, and there is equipment to rent. The only downfall is that parking is 9$ for the day (7$ for 2h)."
Good
"It is the wonderful place to walk, but you can be attaked by mosquitos in the summer months."
Such a beautiful park in the city
"Lots of nature in the cityüòÄüëç
The picnic area is really nice..pretty flowers, water fountain (even for the dog)..lots of tables , beautifull trees and nature..the park is very large and is fun to walk or bike in the summer. The only negative thing is that it is a bit dangerous the cross boul. Gouin (close to the 13) to go from one side of the park to the other side..there should be a cross walk, or something to make it saferüò≤üò≤"
The place is greate! But not well indicated. We got tired after few km of turning around in circles
"Great spot for a nice walk, even if access to the water (from Sunnybrook road) towards the river, is blocked for now."
"Not like the laurentians, but to have such a big park right here in Montreal is quite amazing"
"Awesome park in the west island. Feels like you're in the woods far away from city, yet so close to home. You gotta watch out for tons of mosquitoes in the summer though"
"Nice to walk, some of the paths have access to water"
Best park in town
Cool place to have BBQ with friends.
"Other than Mont-Royal, best urban park on the Island of Montreal for all kind of summer and winter activities. Large and expansive, you will soon forget that you are in a major city. Best place to learn cross-country ski and try out snowshoeing. Sure, there is also Cap-St-Jacques but it is a little too out of the way and tucked in the Northwest corner of the island. This one is smack in the western middle."
"Great place to bike and walk, there are sky rental service in winter"
"Awesome place!
Great for picnics especially in the Summer time.."
"Snow, smile, season.. Super!"
A relatively small natural park suitable for short walks Ong trees...
"Beware!!! Bike route closed. at rail tracks just after passing under the 13 .until October.  No other way to access the other sectors of the park. Only a busy, Boulevard Gouin with no bike lane.  üòûüò¢"
Definitely worth a visit. Nice walks. Bugs galore in summer (now). Great cross country ski trails and snowshoeing. Free parking on the street not on the property.
Great nature park for biking or jogging.
"Nice park for walking, cycling in those nature trails. Close to Highway 13 and easily accessible"
The is place is beautiful but there is no dedicated space for pet so -2 stars
Love taking walks through this forest nice and quiet no city noise
Great park for cross country skiing in the city.
I've been here a few times and I love it. It has lots of paths for both walking and biking although keep in mind some paths are walking only. Also the 13 runs over a part of it so don't expect peace and quiet. It also has a tendency to flood in the spring so be warned. Overall a great nature park.
"I love going there for my long lonely quiet in the woods in the city walk!
Never regretted any time!
Cross-country ski is fun there too!
Tracks and indicators are well maintained!"
Make sure to carry insect repellent ü§ì
Very nice cross country skiing circuits.
Great for picnic and nice trails for cycling
Nice place for a walk in the forest on groomed and marked trails. Public washrooms and picnic areas available. You can easily walk 10k on different trails.
Perfect!
I love walk there
"This well used place is very unusual, a wonderful gem, and friendly park.  Summer requires bug spray.  Lots of wide, well marked paths for walking and biking in the summer.  Lots of paths for cross-country ski and snowshoeing. Around my area, Sunnybrooke entrance, lots of free street parking.  Pay parking on the Douglas B. Floreani main entrance, just off Henri-Bourassa.  This is where the Chalet is, with bathrooms, information, water, and they sell snacks, hot-chocolate, coffee.  Lots of ferns, flowers, plants, birds, animals to see.  Creek and bridges to enjoy, and lookout points, and a few swamp areas, one is getting its wooden walkway rebuilt.  Near the chalet are picnic tables, water fountain, and porta-potty.  In winter the hill here is great for sledding.  Great place to get away from things and hear the forest.  Bigger than it seems, with a second chalet and another place to park.  Streaches to the River Prairies, where those ponds have nice birds and turtles too."
"Nice place, not too busy.  The only downside is the fact that a major highway runs in the middle of the park.  Nice getaway to the country in the city.  You have to pay for your parking which I don't like...all nature parks should have free parking."
Awesome trails and very good support staff
"For an urban park,it is a nice get away"
Its a nice afternoon goto check for events
Great place to get away and relax. Lovely walking  paths.
"If you like walking in the woods or riding your bike on smooth trails, this place is great. It is on the island of Montreal off Gouin Blvd, tucked away from view. My wife and I walk while our kids ride their bikes. It costs $9 a day for parking. Altogether, it's a great way to spend an afternoon."
Walking in the woods in Downtown Pierre fonds Roxboro
A great nature park not far from Montreal. Only 4 star because you still hear some traffic
"only a regular forest , a lot of mosquitos"
"The park is no longer what it was few years ago, needs lot of maintenance"
"A lot of concrete and bike trails. Definitely a park, but there's not a lot of nature..."
Too noisy due to highway
A park in spend lots of time in the natural environment that's filled with lots of mature trees and the wild animals of the woods a must see I highly recommend to all enjoy
Superb
"Nice park, just waiting for more green!"
Picnic area with tables and garden
"Lovely trail, the perfect place for an afternoon stroll.
With the lake in the back drop, this was just added as one of my favorite place to visit."
"Nice, natural park .. it's a pity there aren't beautiful crocuses in spring"
Love all outdoor activities here!
"Swamp area, so not such a good idea during summer time, it buzzes with mosquitos !"
"Very nice forest area in the west island, you can bring your pet to walk the trails this parkas to offer. You can also ride your bike in this place. You can also enjoy this park during the winter time."
A great place to get some exercise
N1ce park üòé
Clean. Well indicated trails. Visitor areas for restrooms and eating are clean and well maintained. A nice slice of nature in the city.
On a beautiful fall day it is a beautiful place for a nature walk. Some areas were closed off though.
Not sure
Nice park to get away from the rest of civilization  and chill out
"Beautiful, good hike! Dogs had a blast too, lots to see!"
"Nice bit of woods in the middle of town. Has been dog friendly for 30 years, I don't know about the future."
"This park is a gem. Not big, though, but good enough to spend an evening in nature. You have to pay to park the car, otherwise is free."
"This nature reserve in the heart of the suburbs is worth visiting. There is a large diversity of animals, many of which are rare such as salamanders and turtles. The reserve has good facilities--bathrooms and seating areas"
Wonderful nature park. Great place for a leisurely walk in some fresh air.
Nice park for 4 seasons of outdoor fun and sports. Biking and jogging paths in the summer and cross country skiing in the winter.
The best kept secret of the entire city. Beautiful cross country skiing and cycling.  I don't understand why it's not full of people 24/7.... I guess it's because there's now WiFi
"There are a few quiet spots in this park that are so precious to me that I don""t want to see them overrun with visitors. I haven""t seen it all, however, nor have I been in winter. In summer, bring inxect repellant - the mosquitoes have not been tamed nor banished."
"Great for cross country skiing, however there are a lot of families with children at peak hours. This leads to many interruptions and having to go around people or slow down"
Great for picnics especially in the Summer time. Awesome place!
Simply beautiful.
Beautiful place
"The place is too disorganized, and lack of maintenance. It is near Montreal, I expect better. It does not worth the trouble to come here. If you're looking for a natural place to walk/hike, find somewhere else."
"Wish i could let my dog go explore, but nevertheless, good place for a walk that makes you feel like you're out of town.."
The park has good paths to walk around. Have a good pair of runners on.
Is nice
It's a nice Parc to do some walking in summer and cross-country skiing in winter.
Love this park! Did a beautiful walk with a group of people and we had a very enjoyable time.
"Well maintained park. Some paths closed during the winter. Parking fee $9 as of March 2016. Signage mostly in French, but easily understood."
"Amazing and gorgeous parc!
A went there for a wedding in the summer and for cross country skiing in the winter.
I had an outstanding experience on both occasions."
Very good place for light hiking in all seasons.
Walk forever but can't shake the sound of  Highway 13 right next to it. If you are looking for peace and quiet... This not the park for you.
peaceful place! keep it like this!
"Beautiful park, nice walking paths. Kids love it here."
"Beautiful walking trails, well marked. Good variety of lengths. Water available too."
One of the largest forests in Montr√©al! On a hot day you can feel the temperature come down the second you bike through it!
"Great trails, well maintained park , huge  fun for everyone"
"Public, no entry fee.  Can make easily 10km loop cross country skiing, snow shoe or trail running"
"Beautiful ""hidden"" treasure in the heart of the West Island with many km's of trails for hikers and cyclists to enjoy, refreshing streams to cool off your pooch, a variety of bird species to discover, and so much more. Love hiking these trails."
"Nice park, lots of tracks, well kept, good variety of different sector to visit within the same park!"
Lovely park with lots of trails for cross coumtry skiing and snowshoeing. trails are.well kept and well indicated.
"The water side is not so impressive surprisingly. The nicer area is the woods area. I recommend starting at the Welcome center off Henry Bourassa in VSL.
The park is very dog friendly and even has a dog bowl near the water fountain."
"Beautiful, peaceful park (despite the 13 highway that goes through it!). My favourite part is Ruisseau Bertrand that runs through it - one of the few surviving uncovered brooks on Montreal island. See my pics of Ruisseau Bertrand, in and outside of the park."
Lovely park to spend some hours walking or jogging. Great colours right now
"It's a very beautiful park ,well Maintained!!! summer ,Autumn and winter."

Small nature park that we use for cross country skiing or just walks in nature.  Recently there are areas closed off for construction so the trails are very short üò•.  Hopefully they will reopen in the spring and we'll have access to all the trails.

Well made pathways. Interesting set up.
The bridge was closed so could not do the whole park.
Still some problems with flooding on the path under the 13. And the construction continues blocking certain paths. Will take time for the undergrowth to grow back in.

Love the path

Beau parc naturel pour faire environ deux heures de marche.
üëå
üòâ
Park with lots of shade. Good for ages 0 to 12
"Lots going on in this parc, my only issue is that maybe there's too much going on as it seems clumped up installations wise. Like on a busy day I avoid it, on a regular day I'm all over it like white on rice üçö"
Very popular outdoor space these days in locked down Mtl.
"A green space just off the canal,  nice for a sit"
My favorite little city park save for huge concret blocks dumped on the grounds now painted black.
"Nice small park , place to play chest, there is a toilet but it's locked in the winter time. There some table under coverage if ever it's raining, you can hide there :)"
Really cool park and ideal for picnics and hanging out with friends.
A good neighbourhood park nearby a bridge. Good for runners and cyclists.
"Cute place to relax, close to Atwater market"
Wow this 8s an amazing bridge
Great park to relax or improvise a picnic after visiting Atwater Market.
Must see
Soon to be named ¬†Daisy Peterson Sweeney Park
"Cute place to chill, pretty quiet but fun! Need to come back here with friends and sports equipment! The got soccer fields, a basketball court, a tennis court, and 2 jungle gyms (one for toddlers and one for older kids)! Still fun though, super nice little green space!"
"Very nice and clean park with lots of playground options for toddlers and older kids, just missing a water activity of sorts. There are a couple picnic tables and benches too which is useful."
"This Pierrefonds park has many Soccer fields, tennis courts and a kids park. Very nice area to spend some time in!!"
"I went to play basketball and there is a new basketball court, very nice and they also have tennis and soccer fields
If you have kids bring them to play in the playground"
"Great green space with several benches, 2 kid parks (one for younger kids, one for toddlers), 1 basketball court, 1 tennis court, and several soccer fields."
"Amazing park. Very green, so it lives upto its' name. This park is so green that i want to become a vegan."
Very nice big park
"The city not even cutting the grass
We all the taxes we paid very bad"
"very simple park, but got to sat in the sun under a blue sky on a small bench and welcome in a very long awaited Spring!"
"Fields are beautifully maintained, benches and bleachers recently added. We go with a trunk full of sports (tennis rackets, basket ball, soccer ball, bats gloves and balls, frisbee). No longer needed with my kids, ut there is a nice and elaborate play park in sand."
"Two different play structures, one for the big kids and one for 3 years and under. Something for everyone to do. And there are about 5 soccer fields for 8-13 year olds. A basketball court and tennis courts. This is a great greenspace with lots to do."

Ok park surrounded by sketchy area..  Avoid.
"Small, cute little park that's a hangout for the locals. Good to place to eat takeout, with plenty of benches and seats."
"It's a beautiful meaningful place but I watched a homeless man walk around on all the benches and spit on them. Don't wear shorts if you sit down.

Also, to the city: please wash the benches."
"Sad excuse for a memorial. Consists of faded rags attached to poles something like your neighbor the crazy cat lady would put out to scare away the crows. Some faded plastic flowers strewn at the base. Popular in summer for people watching while sitting on long granite slabs. The slabs are perpendicular to Ste-Catherine St. so you have to twist sideways to observe the action. When people are sitting here they have their backs to the memorial so it's a neglected backdrop to a hangout which needs to be rethought. Unused green space behind the memorial. Our lost friends and loved ones deserve better than this.
Piano in the summer months is popular. WiFi available from nearby Second Cup. City or local merchants group has not found it worthy to install a WiFi access point (the last time I was there)."
"At the center of the Gay Village, great for people watching, and it is an important memorial to those we have list to AIDS and those living with HIV/AIDS."
"Sometimes the place looks a bit neglected. There is always a group of people relaxing here if the weather is nice. A good place to have a rest, a coffee, and check out the scenery in the Village."
"During summer afternoons, this quiet and comfortable place is great for people watching. Many unusual but safe people hang our here. I do not recommend being here at night because the place gets sketchy."
"From what I understand, the intention of the park is to remember the AIDS crisis, it's not a ""feel-good"" sort of place.  This is a solemn and serious subject, and the park's design engenders this feeling.  It's not a question of like our dislike, it's simply a slightly somber area."
Nice little place where there are some sometimes events.
"It reminds me of the thousands of people our community lost to AIDS, homophobic public health policies and society‚Äôs indifference. They shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten. It also reminds me of how far we‚Äôve come since then and that we must continue to research and stop the spread of HIV. We have the tools to do it now, but must make it a reality."
It's a nice place to.hang out there's a public piano. Mostly older gay men here but the odd admirer of transexual girls approached me here.
Ok park but lots of trash and homeless people
I enjoy sitting here to people watching
Pretty little Parc with beautiful art pieces
Nice spot to sit and take in the scenery
Good
Not the most comfortable of parcs
Loved it just one word for it
Quiet walk
üëå
"Its no Parc J.J Gagnier, but it's alright I guess. Ok for kids and families although there are occasionally some unsavory characters hanging out at the picnic tables. Overall fine but if you're looking for a nice peaceful walk, I suggest you take you business to J.J Gagnier."
Nice PARC with best lit
It was good for the kids

"A great oasis in the midst of the concrete jungle. People are friendly, covid19 responsible, and welcome visitors."
Best serviced oriented person I had to deal with in a long time. Extremely efficient person. Thanks again Mrs Miniaci.
"Love that park, I mean there is a lot of great parks in Montr√©al, but this one is surrounded by coffee places and its not too loud. The light is superb and you can focus on your work"
Very cute little park full of life
Had benches and some grass. Pretty good park 4/5 would sit in again.
Niceee
It was lovely. I had a beer on the gazebo and ate cola gummy candy with my boyfriend. 10/10. Benches were sticky though.
Full of good memories
"Cute park; lots of benches and picnic tables, and often has free events or entertainment in the gazebo and small skating rink in winter. Relaxed atmosphere."
Awesome place to rest and play with squirrels
Great place to meet with friends for a coffee when you need to social distance.
Nice large gazebo available for shows.
Love this park! Look around for Gary. Best heroin in town!!!ü•¥ü§Øüòµ He‚Äôll also do handies for a fiver!
A nice green space with some benches in the middle of the little Italy. Not too big though
It's very accessible and perfect for picnics.
Pretty. Not as clean as it could be.  Sometimes the individuals that hang around the park are hard to look at. Police or security presence is recommended.
"The have this great bench we‚Äôre basically your feet are in the air. It is so relaxing to eat or take a break like that. It‚Äôs open but shaded, great for lunch time nature break or anytime nature play"
Besides Jean talon market plenty of restaurants to discover from pizza to mama Mia and coffee houses a large expresso. All you need is time and the right companion. Italian language is not a necessity. The Italian community has added a special flair to the multicultural aspect of Quebec life. Be friendly and you will be rewarded! Enjoy your venture into this specific area called the little Italy!
"So cozy and so alive! Lots of Activities, I love how they bring a trailer and create a mini skating ring every winter.Whit a changing room, bathroom and They refresh the ice on regular bases. A Great place to make a picnic or bring your take out from one of many great restaurants near by (Be awesome and bring your reusable Tupperware!!! ;D ;D) and enjoy the smell of the threes and the squirrels that are accustomed to humans beings. (PS: theres a great restaurant that even provides you a picnic basket with everything you need inside nearby to enjoy exactly this XD) Very clean the city takes good  care of their little Italy Park. Deft recommended !"
"This smaller park is situated at the southern entrance of what is traditionally known in Montreal as Little Italy or Piccola Italia. After shopping around in the streets surrounding it, it's great to sit down under the shade of a tree. Occasionally, you still meet neighborhood dwellers who are of Italian descent, but this is becoming rarer since the younger generation has mostly moved away."
The park has lots of space alot of seating available
"Very nice park, with a pretty kiosk, comfortable sit banks, and a clean restroom."
Very cute spot across from Dante Pizzeria. A good spot to read..practise guitar..picnic..5 minutes from Jean Talon market
Great park. Skating in winter and music in summer. An oasis on a hot day.
Feel.of europe
An amazing experience... Little Italy
Always a nice place to hangout
"Nice park to bring your dog, and there are lots of benches. Too bad it‚Äôs right next to a busy street."
Nice place to get break from the movement even if it surrounded by streets you feel relax!
"Nice park in the summer. Grab food from a nearby restaurant and enjoy it here!

The traffic all around can almost be forgotten for a while."
"Fantastic little park in Little Italy. Great for picnicking, and they have the cutest little tiny outdoor skating rink in the winter."
"Really nice park to have a picnic with friends. A lot of events happen at the gazebo during summer (free dance lessons, concerts, etc.)."
Nice atmosphere in a beautiful area
"Cute little park with benches, picnic tables and grass."
Amaaaazing place to rest and to have a picnic
Not the best or biggest park I've ever been too but still decent.
My summertime hangout. Great for picnics (which you can source from Dinette Triple-Crown down the street).
Nice place where you can eat with your wine on a table inside the park.
Small and quaint.  A pleasant spot to stop and watch the squirrels.
Nice little park near Little Italy. You can also get food from some of the restaurants nearby and eat there!

"Cute little street of italy, very famous, and lots of good real italian restaurant. Worth to come visit."
"A tiny parc, with a big flow.

On a hot day, you will see it filled with a very diverse set of people,
Including hobos, hipsters, dog walkers, families, and old italians...
Often sharing the common trait of being drunk.

A random little parc, trapped in the chaos of a big street, and the livelihood of a fully alive neighborhood."
very nice
"Great market, lots of vegetables."
"Take some time for a picnic , walk or even a coffee! this park is filled with excitement."
Beautiful place to hang out!
"Pretty good little Parc for a picnic, but not much else."
Good place if you want to learn to ice skate.
Cute little parc at the entrance of little italy.
Great place for a stroll

"The park is a pretty patch of green and be sure to walk the footpaths, but the fabled history of Cite Jardin (1941 workers' coop) is long gone.  Just another middle class preserve and the vibe is stay out if you don't live there."
Secluded
Nice little park.

Beautiful park layout
Small park with playground for kids.

Beautiful park!! Lot's of swings and hamacs for all ages. I recommend it for picnics or just hanging out.
Nice place to enjoy the nature without having to leave the island.
Great park for kids of al ages!
Great park with a huge children's play area. There are plenty of seats around the play area for parents to relax. Especially loved the sturdy hammocks. There's also a decent skating area. Good place to spend a day. There's also a mc donald's branch right opposite to the park entrance.
Great park! They have a variety of things for the kids to play on. My kids loved it there!
"I go here to chill.

Really nice park. Great for kids.

"I was almost attacked by some ducks. So much poop. Landmines everywhere. A cute little squirrel came up to me seeking some nuts, I told him I had none so he left. Very lovely place other wise. The girlfriend appreciated the scenery. :) Would visit again."

Walking. Arrived from McDonalds across the street.‚Äô Lajeunesse, on the back of a private scooter. we ordered two coffee s XZtra Large, mine with 4 sugars 3 cream. Popped off the scoot and there I was..
These people have built a brand new park inside of the old one. The ild skatepark (old*) was still there but clearly back shadowed by this new Adult Themed Park.
Like, are we all supposed-to quit our day jobs and start having fun in the blimmin park?
It seams like that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve decided to build for humane sakes. Theyre not bad people, they invested 49 million dollars in the 15 to 30 age group."

"Well thought out park with all kinds of facilities and landscaping, something for everyone. A beautiful urban park!"

"It's very nice park, but unfortunately the Fontaine wasn't working and the play ground under construction"
"This is a great park, it has something for everyone. A pond/fountain allows you to admire ducks and geese. A baseball diamond (Gary Carter stadium) is home to the Ahuntsic Orioles. The walkways will lead you around the park to either of the above or the following : the dog park accomodates small dogs in one section and larger ones in the other. The skatepark has a few rails and ramps. The children's play area has the usual set up, slides, swings, a toddler's corner and such.
So be it for sitting on a bench, feeding a duck or doing a grind you will find it here.
Take note that downhill sledding is possible as there is a small ""hill""."
Great park! And has a little work out area
"Great family park! Basketball court, baseball diamond, soccer pitch, gym play or workout area, walking paths, picnic benches, ping pong table, shuffleboard.... so much!! great for a run, walk, playing with friends and family."
"It clean
But has a clogged drinking fountain. Which is the ONLY drinking fountain.
Needs more picnic tables.
Needs more benches.

However, they have a very good connection to wifi over there."
One of my favorite parks in Montreal. It's very large and a great place for kids and adults alike. I love looking at the birds enjoying themselves in the lake.

Nice park. Had a picnic by the pond. Lots of Canadian geese and ducks around the lake. Lots of picnic tables too.
"The birds run this place. They never stated a fee for entry, but you'll leave with less than you entered with. I came with myself and a friend. I left alone. I never imagined geese could feast on so much flesh."
"It's a great park hidden behind the metro, perfect for Dallas with dogs and family"
Great community park. Lots geese around.
Love the new playground

"Nice views , great little Italian restaurants."
üëå nice
Great little park my only issue with this place is all the weed smokers we now have here thinking now that its legal they can smoke wherever they want. Awesome thing they have here is a fountain but the biggest issue with it is we didn't get one that recycle the water it's going straight into the sewer.
Great place to spend the day and to do aquatic sports.

"Good parc, there's work out equipment and a soccer field for public use"
Parc Toussaint-Louverture is a smaller neighborhood park that is very popular on a sunny day because it has a couple of courts where neighborhood kids congregate to play basketball. It also has a few benches for onlookers.

I came here but theres alot of construction. Wouldnt recommend because i did not see any where to sit down and enjoy the parc due to construction
Always enjoy playing ice hockey at this park.

"I love The place, we saw a kids throwing rock to the gooses and we try to stop them it should be at list signs or something for protect the wild nature because it seems some people don't know how to behaved and be respectful"

Nice place for a quick dip in the water.
"Nice and calm place, your obstacle would be the parking thu!"
Awesome spot in the neighborhood with lots of views of the river and plenty of green space. Nice to have such a place to go for a walk in the neighborhood. Can be tough to find parking nearby on the weekends in summer specially so if you can walk or take the bus to get to this park it would be best. Some fellow users should pay more attention to the garbage they leave in the place.
"Quiet, there's people but not extremely crowded, I love it!"
"Clean park, perfect for a picnic with the family or a little walk with waterside paths."
First time here. Lovely park. Pretty scenery. Lots of places to sit for quiet contemplation.

A beautiful park near to the river.
"Beautiful park. It has a lake and it is a great place to do a picnic. A lot of families and kids running around. The only problem will be finding a place where to park. Other than that, grab your picnic basket and enjoy the day"

Nice park but can be crowded.
"Great place, nice view and fun to walk around."
Good place to see ducks and relax near the water.
Nice place to be in contact with nature. However too many visitors especially cyclists which make walking especially with young children hazardous.

The parc de la Merci is a nice waterfront area to relax in. It's one of the nicest places at the top of the island.
"Small habitat of birds and insects, this parc shows us the important of biodiversity around the city of Montreal"
Amazing place but some people have to be more considerate about where they put the garbage...

Great view & awesome place to canoe
Nice place
Very beautiful
Very dirty
Amazing
"Lovely park by the river, a cycling path runs through it. The view is sublime during sunset. Lots of family come here to do barbeques, cyclists need to go slowly as there's lots of kids, also, beware of ice forming in the morning during autumn and spring, it can get slippery in the 90 degree turn near the retirement home."
"Very nice for walks, bicycling and jogging, good spot for family outings and a few nice spots for fishing."
WoW
Cool
Simple ; but just amazing.
Nice park next to River Prairie. It has a cycle track which is well maintained.
One of the beautiful place to visit
I love this park and it's one of those must-visit parks in Montr√©al. The view of the Saint Lawrence River is stunning and its absolutely amazing to go jogging in the morning or afternoon.
It's a small 'park' by the river. I went there with a few friends to have a picnic. The park is in need of quite a few more benches and garbage cans.
It's pretty good
Good place to see some Canada ducks and relax near the water.

"Great experience, I had so much fun playing there"
A landscaped former landfill repurposed to an urban park. Massive open space with futuristic-looking gas vent bubbles. Ideal for strolling/jogging/biking.
Nice park. Little crowded when I visited but we liked it.
No parking spot but there are alot of activities that anyone could love
Nice place to bike
Nice park for kids üòÖ
"Connecting with Park Fr√©d√©ric-Back makes the place more special. 4 soccer fields for different comps (4v4, 7v7, 11v11). 1 bball field and a playground."
"Last soccer game before covid restrictions
Great soccer field"
"Very nice, smaller park at the corner of the quarry."

Really nice playground.
"Nice trails, new playgrounds for children aged two/three and also older children. Trails take you along nice scenery. The spheres are very interesting to view, they make the landscape somewhat exotic."
Nice playgrounds for toddlers and older kids ! Theres somw huge swings for parents to relax while watching the kids or normal benches. theres big soccer fields and basket ball place. You can also ride your bike around the parc and theres also some events some times. Really love it.
Great to bring your kids or have nice long walks. Also amazing to ride your bike because there is a loong walking/cycling road!
"Great park! awesome for walks, running or bicycles. If you have roller-blade or skateboard, go ahead to Taz complex instead."
I used to live close by the park very quite and nice place to come with the kids and family and a very big park a lot of activities to do

"Very nice parc wide and specious,the only problem is the garbage that people leave behind them."
Nice little park. Few swings and kids play area.
"What a gorgeous park. So well-laid out and so functional. There's a Trekfit installation (a super gym space, brilllllliant concept) and fields and sports turfs of all kinds. Lots of free parking around too, you just have to be patient and hunt for it. Enjoy!"
Awesome parc. Nice rinks in the winter and good vibes only in the summer üçª
"This is a large park north of Ave Laurier. It's excellent for people watching and dog observation. If you are lucky, a Chihuahua will come up to your ankle and smell it. The next thing you know, you will have made a new friend. I don't recommend trying this yourself with a fellow human. In the age of covid, smelling stranger's ankles is not only a social distancing taboo, but it's also kind of creepy. Unless you have been invited to do so, in which case, it's none of my business. You will be observed however: this is a public park."
My favourite park. The proximity to so many cool restaurants and stores makes it ideal for impromptu picnics
I grew up two blocks away from that park and it was much cleaner. Too much litter everywhere. Trash cans are always full and a it's always on recondition mode. No feeling of attachment anymore. Too bcbg like we say in french.
"This place is great, you have drinks with your friends the police dont bug you, swiming pool is free all week, just saterday and sunday you pay 5.00 ."
Tonight with the full moon and rose-coloured sunset it was simply sublime.
One of my favorite parks in the city - top notch planning in terms of flow and people focus
"Went for a picnic in that park for a friend‚Äôs birthday, and we had loads of fun. The bathrooms are not great, but overall it‚Äôs a nice but very busy place"
Love Laurier for ice skating!  They have 3 ice rinks and a skating path.  They do a decent job in cleaning it daily as well.
"Beautiful park extremely quiet with people scattered about doing different things from reading to playing the guitar and a few ladies having fun.
Most appealing of the area it‚Äôs the Centre Laurier....has restrooms that are so so clean!"
Very nice. Pool in the summer. Many snow man now in the winter
"Great park with playground, baseball court, public pool"
They have outhouse in the middle of January which was very clean... thrilled about it because I needed a bathroom while I was running and no where is open these days
A great place to set up a hammock and lounge
The place to go to take a breath around Laurier- regardless the season!
"Parc Laurier is a lovely park for sure, with a sizeable pool and tidy washroom.  Big leafy, shady trees in the summer & skating area in winter.  There is a park for children and space for people who like to work out. Soccer field, baseball field, dog park..you name it there is a bit of everything here."
This one is in the top 10 parks of the city.
Best place to let yourself go and have a good time with friends
"Lots of French people in there.
Is this a invasion ?"
"Nice parc, very clean."
"This park has always been a favorite of mine. There is always something going on day or evening during the warm months. During winter, there is a hockey rink and ice skating always available

There is a large variety of shops, food choices, coffee shops and even ice cream all within short walking distance. This is a great place to get lost in our great montreal culture!"
Nice place with lots of rooms for kids to play
"Nice green space, great for walking the dog."
Nice big park. Good for kids and adults.
"Very cool park to hang out with friends and/or family. The park has a lot of amenities, such as a: soccer field, table tennis, outdoor gym, swimming pool (not functioning at the moment because of the virus) and a little league baseball field. It is very nice to hang out here, you can bring your dog and make some delicious bbq and play outdoor games, you name it. Love this place."
"A beautiful park in our neighborhood with amenities like dog park, swimming pool, picnic spots and kids play area. Family friendly park bordering Laurier Avenue surrounded by lot of small business and boutiques."
"Weed, bbq, Spike ball and molkee every where"
A really nice park in the heart of the plateau. You can sit on the grasse or at some tables. There‚Äôs also a football and a baseball field.
It was a nice park. It's large and dog friendly with lots of room to run around.
Really nice park. Loved going there with my friends.
Really nice place. Love the different spots in the park. Everything is so close and it‚Äôs perfect for a chilling
Beautiful park. Just a swell place to hang out.
"Great place to walk your dog, run, bike or have a picnic"
All locations have been very nice to me with very good variety and wonderful prices
Too busy for my liking and lots of broken glass on the ground. There is a big playground though and lots of green space which is nice. Very little parking that isn't zone parking.
Good place to picknick

"Very cute park with so many cafes restaurants, SAQ and groceries within short walking distance! Very easy to have a nice day around there or a picnic"
"Lovely place to enjoy the nature, thw water andhave a good time"

Very nice park for picnics. There's even a pool.. Nice local merchants all around as well.
"Probably the best park in the area even if it‚Äôs generally crowded during the summer.  There a pool on site, the ability to BB-Q, and no shortage of restos, bottle-Os and ice-cream parlours."
"Clean public bathrooms, a dog park, outdoor pool and a baseball field. One of my favorite spots to relax with friends, day or night!"
Nice park with ohtdoor pool and lots of trees. Close to metro.  Can be overcrowded
"Crowded most days, it's fine if you just want a place to be loud outside. Good for kids."
Nice inner city open air park with plenty of mature trees and picnic tables.  Well maintained.
"Good park lots of dogs, a pool, park benches and picnic tables. Shade and paths and bathrooms. Couldn't ask for more."
I love this parc
"Just beautiful, nice trees also good to do some sports"
"Very nice park to relax with friends or family.  There are big trees for those who like to breathe, and even a playground for children.   This park is popular because I have never seen it empty."
"Peaceful and beautiful parc. There's a big swimming pool, which is open during summer and it's quite clean."
Very close to Lapin Press√© so it's perfect to enjoy your coffee or smoothie
Passed by one night with my bike to hear (cause there's no light at all) a live kind of gitano band fooling around to a dancing crowd. It was beautiful.
"Nice place to hang out with your friends and family, close to the Metro grocery store."
"Beautiful park with playground for children, baseball field, pool! Yotally recommended."
Nice park
"This park is nice but the rules are annoying. You can't drink if you dont have food anf if you finish your food and stilk have alcoholic drinks, you'll have to throw them out. Also You cannot unleash your dog"
"Beautiful park with a good amount of picnic table seating if needed. It's also about 5-10 minutes from groceries and from the metro if needed. The park does get somewhat crowded in the summer months, and the squirrels can get a little brave, but overall this is a great place to relax!"
"Fun park, clean and well lighted"
Great enclosed play area for kids with lots of climbing structures and sand!  This is a very big park with an ice rink in winter and a pool in summer. Popular for picnics big and small.
Great little green space in Montreal

Amazing park! One of my favorites in Montreal
Beautiful park to chill with friends and family or to have a nice picnic lunch
It is just a quiet place to sit.
Beautiful parc! Nice place to trained!
"One of the best kids pool in the city. On the weekends the wait can be long but it's worth it especially for small childrens as the ground of the pool is soft instead of concrete.
I also think that there's a fee to get in the pool on the weekend something like 5 dollars per person."
"Nice shady park.  Perfect for picnics, p√©tanque, then a dip in the pool."
Awesome üòâüëç
Clean and green park. Often gets crowded. Pool and kids playground are very popular. Nice place to catch amateur softball games. There is also a dog park.
Fun and chill place. Very friendly squirrel lol!
"Large park with playing area for young kids, soccer and softball field, dog walking area, ping-pong tables, p√©tanque, etc..."
"Got drunk here a couple times, pretty good."
"Good place to relax, have a picnic or to tan in summer. Barbecues are allowed. The park can be very crowded on sunny days"
Solid park. Great benches. Perfect for sitting and chatting with friends. Be warned: do not feed the squirrels. They get super mean when people feed them and then dont have food to pay tribute later.
Good place to hangout with families and friends..m
"Great parc  to do all kinds of activities! You'll see the locals running or enjoying the swimming pool (free on weekdays not on weekends). There is a baseball and a soccer field, concrete ping-pong tables, a p√©tanque area... You'll definitely find something for you. And a lot of green space to chill with your friends! There is a grocery store, cute coffee shops and delicious ice-cream nearby! It can be quickly crowded on sunny days but that give a joyful ambiance to this park!"

Love this park. Been living in the area for many years and it's great to spend time with family any time of the year.
"Awesome spot for the summer! It's not the biggest park and it gets really crowded but it does not take away from the experience. It actually adds to it, as it gives a great balance between space and community."
"It's cute and clean, but not doing anything to really stand out, and that's okay."
There was an organized training going on.
"Very lovely park. Soccer, baseball field, swimming pool, playground for kids.. cement ping pong tables... Full of people, full of life, very vibrant"

"This is one of my favourite parks in the world, and all the dogs in the dog park are very cute."
"A really nice park in the middle of the Plateau. Good location. The chalet and the restrooms are a little small.  There are some deppaneurs nearby to go buy food for a picnic. Just a warning: there are always guards walking around and you can get a fine for having drinks without a Meal (having a picnic with snacks is not enough).
The dog park is very popular also."

Gorgeous park and lovely pool for all to enjoy. Especially the free yoga class on Saturdays !
Great place to make a new squirrel friend! üêøüòä

Death to the squirrels
Lovely place to spend the afternoon
Good park with play area and pool and picnic tables!
Small park for walks. Big dog park. Lots of people. Film projections in summer. Outdoor pool and ping pong tables. Outdoor gym and baseball field.

lovely park
"A lot of jonkies are smoking tobacco and marijuana or drinking alcohol everywhere and everyday. It's an open loud outdoor spring break bar atmosphere (day and night) It looks like Plateau mayor Luc Ferrandez¬†doesn't care about it. Why?
Because the mayor (best known as The King Without Crown or Little Napoleon) may has a power trip reload or anger manegment issues. He doesn't have a ecological planification (√©coquartier) or a urban security program strategy (Tandem) :
1
""Key city-council ally Luc Ferrandez called the attempted explanation ""amateurish."" That, along with subsequent apologies, turned a two-day story about a tax hike into a saga.""
2
""... the mayor Ferrandez posted comments in French on his Facebook page that target not only politicians, but the general public, including flood victims for current environmental problems.

The post, which has since been taken down, started with the words: ‚Äúf*** you, all of us.‚Äù"
"Huge park close to Mile End / Plateau with many options.  You can go to relax with friends and picnik, you can go with your family and kids, and you can also practice sports: they have baseball stadium and calisthenics park."

Nice park. Love it üëçüëç
One of the good places In downtown  for pictures ..
"I celebrated my last birthday with a picnic with friends. It was a bit chilly so might not have been the best idea. The park has picnic tables. We brought our portable bbq, I'm not sure if they allow bbq with propane/gas tanks. Also they should probably set a container for burnt coal. We didn't want to risk starting a fire in the trash can so we had to dig some holes in the ground to dispose of the coal."
Beautiful os very green absoluty.
Decent size park. Has an outdoor pool that's free on summer weekdays. The pool also had parasols and shaded areas. The park also includes a baseball diamond.
Very nice place to go read
"Everything you could want in a park... Plenty of green space, trees, a large swimming pool, and an area for games.  People of all ages are there at any time of day during the summer months."
Decent pool to cool off in with separate baby pool and toys. However they do let kids up to aged 9 into baby section.
I love this park. Very calm place to spend time with the family
"Nice park, accessible via bike path, with playground and pool and plenty of people barbecuing, but it gets a bit too crowded and the bathrooms are pretty gross."

Free during the week. Bad point is that it‚Äôs a bit dirty
"Beautiful park, but gets outrageously busy on weekends and sunny days. Abundant amount of amenities such as picnic tablea, dog run, baseball field, p√©tanque pitches, public pool. Y'a trop de Fran√ßais sur le plateau üéµ"
"Very pleasant urban park!

Lots of space, and everyone is very friendly and respectful."
great dog park actually has space for the dogs to run! nice park over all
"Has a pool and is usually pretty crowded. Lately the cops have been cracking down on alcohol consumption without meals, so if you are looking to continue drinking beers after you picnic ends, you may be best heading to a different park.

The park also closes at 11 or 12, and this is pretty strictly enforced (ie. cop cars literally driving through the park). An ok park but not one of my favourites."
"Nice place for a picnic, there's a pool in the park soo good place when we have hot temperature in the summer!"

So many fun things to do here...
"This park is one of the places I recommend people visit when coming to Montreal. It isn't a tourist attraction by any means, but it's an excellent place to spend an evening meeting locals and experiencing the culture.

I don't know of a city where people use their parks more than the Montrealais. There are a few things that contribute to it. Culturally, we are very community-oriented. Hanging out with neighbors is natural and easy. Spending time outdoors on beautiful days makes the hard winters more bearable. Park areas are highly valued public spaces, and are better maintained than roads. Tiny apartments with alleys and the classic Plateau three-storey walk-up townhouse make for lots of people with no yards. So we collect at the park, often entire blocks or extended families having regular barbecue soirees or cinq-a-septs.

Reasonable city laws allow wine or beer, so long as you are decent enough to have a picnic table, a table cloth, and a meal to accompany your drinks (though many people just go for wine and hummus/baguette on overturned jackets under a tree- the point is, be civilized.) Free wifi means people come to work on their laptops on picnic tables under the shade of trees. Benches set in circles are a natural place for musicians to gather for jam sessions. Most often I see klezmer, strings quartets, or folky accordion here, occasionally a small drum circle and group of dancers off to the side. There is a generously-sized, fenced-in playground  for families with children only, and it improves the park experience for everyone. I often see numerous families there, potluck picnics spread across many tables with all children playing together til 11pm while the parents enjoy some adult conversation over prosecco.

Because the park is so well-loved by locals, it has little of the danger associated with city spaces at night. Occasionally highschoolers will hop over the fence to dive into the pool, but that's as much trouble as you'll see. It seems that because they city treats its citizens with such attentive humanity in these spaces, the people rise to a standard of civility in them. In the warmer months, wooden loungers and stands for hammocks are raised, and in the winter a skating rink is set up for hockey, as well as a meandering skating path through the trees.

There are amenities for bocce ball/ Petanque, badminton, table tennis,  outdoor exercise (ramps, chin-up bars, etc.), and horseshoe all along Brebeuf, near the midpoint. There is a soccer field, baseball diamond, off-leash dog park, and free public swimming pool. A central building offers washroom facilities, and there are several water fountains. There is a Metro grocery store right at Brebeuf and Laurier and a SAQ a couple doors down, so you can pick up your picnic supplies there- no need to trek them along on the metro with you."
"chilling, calm and even suitable for kids! great pool also"

"love it, its just on the next street from my house"
Good park for BBQ but there few places
Great park for a picnic. There's a pool and a fountain too
My only complaints is that the cops can be very obnoxious when then time to leave the park comes. Politeness doesn't seem to be a concern. Just ask and we will vacate.

Tr√®s beau parc.  J'y ai r√©cup√©r√© des grosses f√®ves au sol pr√®s des arbres. Il y en avait d'autre encore dans les arbres. Quelqu'un sait quelle sorte d'arbre c'est ?
"This park is mainly soccer fields rather than an actual park in which you walk and sit down. I can't give it more than 3 star rating due to not being practical as a park, but it's clean and when it's open you can still go sit on the grass (and the soccer field bleachers)."
The park is fenced. I saw people playing soccer.
Beatiful see boya & giros training
To register the soccer club go to google and search assom
Soccer field is well maintained and in excellent condition.
"Field needs some work, but good park"
Great park for all the family

"A nice place to spend time with friends and family. There's a playground and a barbecue spot. Tennis courts, stadium and a free public swimming pool in the summer"
Beautiful park
"Great community access park for the residents in the nun's island. It is possible to cook on BBQ installed and provided for the residents as well as there is a children play ground in the premises next to a tennis court, it is a good place to spend time with family and friends as well as to interact with the neighbours."
"It`s nice, however things are changing on the IDS in general. Still a nice place and the Elgar center can stand to have more activities."
Beautiful and breath taking natural garden.
"Great space. Public BBQs. A community center a community store. Amazing for kids. Tennis courts, mini climbing wall and lots of fun."
I always bring my daughter here... she loves it because she meets Her school friends. Fun play area
Not bad but needs some renovations.
Enjoyable atmosphere in a nice part of town
Great Community Park. Met a lot of friendly parents.
üëçüåûVery nice!
We enjoyed the park and skating was fun
"Great to visit with your family and friends. It has Tenis, Basketball, football and a few games for the kids."

I had an awesome moment there with my friends!

Very frequent children playing at the end of the day. Locals enjoy a lot.
Almost Zen.
Good place to play tennis!
Beautiful n fun place to visit.
You have a lot of games for kids :)
Fantastic place for Tennis
Nice
Tennis courts.

Very good
needs improvement
Great park in Montreal east for kids and familly. Is well equipped and there s a great swimming area on the side for children as well as adults.
Small nice park :)
Great parc. A nice long walk by the side of the st Laurence. A great place to go unwind and think.
Beautiful clean safe with amazing views
"Had a really great time on this park. You can enjoy the river, outdoor pool (Piscine Paul-√âmile-Sauvageau), volleyball and recharge your energy with a delicious picnic ;)"
"Near my appartment, big Green park along st Lawrence river bank."
Wow
This is a beautiful square and where I fell in love with Montreal.  This photo is from 2006 when I was 7 months pregnant with my son.  We have had a place in Montreal now for 13 years.  It is a wondeful city filled with wonderful people.
"Oh please take me back what a beautiful experience. This place was gorgeous and full of history I truly recommend it , bring your family or come on a solo trip but you can't be living without coming here is like going to Europe."
"Had a nice walk around this area that offered a cool lively ambiance full of people and places to shop and visit. There were street performers that made the experience fun and entertaining, a variety of shops and restaurants around to try the local cuisine. In the afternoon when the sun sets is where this place offers one of the best views in the city. So much do to, so little time."
"Nice view, with nice buildings. In summer, the view is amazing. Peoples always only want to go Old Port, but this place is good also!"
Nice little square next to the city hall with fountains and statutes.
"Nice place for a break to admire the story of this historical place, I suggest you visit this place by night (I will add other pictures soon)"
"After having dinner at the Jaques-Cartier square, I just cross the street for finding a station. I found an open place(park) on the top of stairs. Good to relax!"
Nice Plaza with the city hall one side and the statue of Jean vauquelin who came to Canada as a part of seven year's war. You can walk a little further and see champ de Mars. Very green and scenic.
A public square with a fountain facing the place jacque cartier. Great place to watch the crowd and unwind.
"A gorgeous place in Montreal with all the landmarks right next to each others. A great place to sit and enjoy the view, the people and even the waterfront from a distance. There are old buildings like the Service des Finances de la Ville de Montr√©al and Montreal City Hall, Nelson's Column and Place Jacques-Cartier is full of shops, restaurant and vendors. If you still have time, you can walk down to the waterfront."
Place is located nice in the center of the market. Good service but the food was pricey. I understand that it's a tourist spot and not many repeat customers but the food quality and quantity compare to prices were not justified. It's not even that the food was outstanding. Its average food. You can find better choices all around.
It was a pleasant place to rest a bit and had a nice view of the old port.
"Super nice area to hang around, dip your feet in the wading pool and listen in on a few tour guides."
Amazing in the night üåô ‚ú® üëå üíï üíõ üíô üåô
So pretty and joyful in every season. Great vantage point in old town.
Good for a few moments of entertainment.
"Summer is so much fun to visit this place! It is a young crowd, family-oriented environment. Go on a slow motion to capture the grandeur of the scenery."
Don' be visit christmas season
"Cute little fountain and park. Nice safe place to stop and rest or read, on the edges of the old port of Montreal."
"Where: Vauquelin Place, Montreal
What: A square with fountains just beside City hall
How was it: It's a nice place to check out while you are heading towards the Old Port.  It's especially nice if you are coming from Champ de Mars and you climb up the stairs.
Sadly this year there are huge renovations and you cannot go through.  It was nice before and it will be again...
Grade: Eli = 3+, Serge = 4
Recommend : Yeah."
Nice place to spend an evening! While we were in canada; the temperature touched 96 F ; truly a good place during this time. I liked the overall feel of the old Montreal.
Very pleasant place... takes us back a century... could have enjoyed more but for the weather...
Great quiet place to rest and relax in a beautiful sunny day
One of the places you should visit in Montreal!!
Its so calm and amazing there and you get to know a lil bit of Montreal history.
"Located quite centrally in Montreal, the Vauquelin place has a historic importance. It is worth the visit to take in the predominant French culture of the city."
Love it
"Beautiful fountain with a nice waterwork in front if Montreals Mars field close to the old port. Because the fountain is only about 50 cm deep, it also serves as a fun cooling spot for kids and even adults if the weather is hot."
Very nice place to take some photos...
Worth checking out if you are already in the old port
"Very nice square with a water fountain and a monument. It is worth to go there in the evening, see lights of the fountain and have a bit of rest from crowded streets of the Old Montreal."
Nice place to relax after a long walk...
Great plaza with an amazing fountain where the kids get in and wet their feet on hot summer days.
Its awesome place for night life
Great spot .lovely old building n evenings are fantastic. Projector projecting on huge building
"Nice place to relax in Montr√©al. Just at the side of the beautiful H√¥tel de Ville and with a nice fountain where you can sink your feet in water during the hot summer days (apparently legally, as everybody was doing it and the side of the fountain resembles the side of a little pool)."
Pleasant place to relax.
"On a hot day, it's nice to just hang out at the fountain."
So beautiful!! The old Montreal is such an amazing place.
"Public square next to l'Hotel de Ville, Montreal's city hall. It was recently renovated and it is now very clean and modern. It have a nice view of Downtown Montreal and chinatown's gate. Oh and one of the X-Men movies was filmed right there!"
"Beautiful, even more during summer time"
Lot's of history here. Great place for people watching and some great views of the city.
Very nice place to have a walk and enjoy the fabulous architecture and history if old Montreal.
Amazing views
totally acceptable small square but not a point of interest really
Good street for a nice evening walk
I had a very nice summer night there.
Nice place for weekend enjoyment with family
Best tourist place in Montreal.
Great sights awesome architecture.
Nice attractive place for visitors

"Mon endroit favoris depuis qu'il as √©t√© r√©nover ,pour relaxer !"
"Not the most elaborate park, but less people and smaller so easier to keep an eye on my son. He really liked it!"
"Nice little parc with enough shadow and picnic tables.
Modules are brand new and diverse."
"It is so beautiful park, so big and it has stone coast and sand coast both are amazing. Too much fun for the families and who loves the nature. BBQ is allowed."
"I love this park. Very good nature, along the river, lots of trails. It has an animal farm as well. Perfect bbq spots."
Nice park where you just pay for parking. Did a walking trail in the winter. Well separated ski/walk/fat bike/cross country trail. It should be nicer in the summer by the water.
"Amazing national park, there are multiple routes to walk around. Very beautiful and clean."
"We are blessed in Montreal to have many nature parks.
This one is situated on the western tip of the island. We had a great autumn walk of 5 kilometres. Exhilarating!"
"Beautiful! Easy to follow any public health regulations in this huge park. Lovely scenery and very peaceful. A must, especially if you live on the island."
"Its a great place,  natural and safe to enjoy with your family and friends"
"The frozen lake was super fun to walk on! :)
Parking is easily accessible as there are many parking lots, and the park is very well maintained."
"Cute park, and parking is only around 10 dollars for the day. I only saw a small portion but it looks like there's a lot to explore"
"Should be more poilce in the area due to the young disrespectfull youth who dont follow the law. They should only make it available for west islanders its disgusting what these delinquints are doing very dirty noisy. Or they should charge 30$ for people who dont live in the West island. These people have no respect for our beauitful nature we have in our area. Very happy to see police Check points today Saturday June 12, 2021 also check points for drunk or high drivers."
Beautiful place with lots of hiking and bike trails. There are also some nice little beaches.
"This park is good for cycling , walking . Has a small farm with animals. Perfect place to have a picnic too."
"Best park in the West Island , theres a beach , bike trails , a farm"
"It's a relaxing place, parking is not free you have to pay it on the machine $7 for 2 hours, $9 for all day."
"Amazing outdoors experience all year round, can do a lot of activities with the family. Lots and lots of spaces to explore, close to the city, can't ask for better!"
Beautiful nature in every season. Biggest park in Montreal and a great beach.
Beaver is a very nice trail. It is full of mosquitos but it is worth it!
"A JEWEL !  ALL YEAR ROUND.

If you like to walk you can combine different routes,  coming early in the morning you will find yourself alone...
Weekends off course are more crowded!
Parking lots are spacious...I always would recommend to buy a full year  membership...to avoid  the parking fees of 7.50 / 9.00 $ per 2 hours / day...
A really good cause , running a information center and bathrooms,  at normal times.
We really have to save  areas like this!"
Nice place with natural beauty. On weekends is very crowded and many people not following social distancing and not wearing masks
Great fishing if you know the spot.
Great park to have a great time and cut out from the city with friends and family. The park is well located as it s about 50mn drive away from Montreal. There are all the amenties and equipment available to spend a great day! The beach is ‚Ä¶
"This proved a pleasant surprise. Scenic River walks or biking with well appointed picnic areas and beachfront views.
Family friendly working farm with livestock within short walk as well much more to be seen."
I was lucky to live close to Cap-Saint-Jacques park. It‚Äôs a beautiful place where people can do many activities 4 season
"The trails are beautiful, in the middle of the woods, and they go on and on.
There is a rental facility and a toboggan hill.
It's a great family place."
"I quite like this Park, it is tucked away in Pierrefonds, and it was a bit of a journey to get there from East Montreal, but worth it. There is a small, quaint beach, and trails that are easy to follow and walk on around the beach and surrounding area. There was hardly anyone there, which makes it very attractive.
The building with a cafe was closed, but very cool to see such a beautiful old structure close to the beach.
It's a gem in the far reaches of Montreal west."
"Lots of people,  social distancing was a challenge. The trails were well maintained. Strange detours on the trails üòê"
"Excellent place to visit, good beach. Private and public. If you are into biking , don‚Äôt miss to ride here. Very good bike path."
A good place for a barbecue and to have fun with friends but the downside is that there is no playground for kids so you have to brings what's needed from home to let the kids enjoy
"Beautiful park. Ideal for hiking, cycling, picnics, and just spending some time in the nature."
"Will definitely go back, and will share experience with others to visit as well"
"Nice place near the house, the only thing is when the nearest parking is full prepare to walk 15-20 min whith small children and your belongings, not a fun."
"Nice place year round. Younger kids love to visit the farm animals. In winter you can xcountry ski, snow shoe, ride a fat-bikeand walk. The terrain is flat. Parking is 7.50$ for less than two hours and 9.50$ for more than two hours."
"One of my favourite nature trails at any time of year with my kids. Lots of areas with picnic benches. By the water. There is a beach. My kids love the farm. You can buy vegetables and eggs from the farm. There are indoor toilets by the farm and outhouses along the trails. There is a nice diversity of trees if you're learning about nature with your kids. Also, this is part of a network of nature parks on this island. If you like going to these places regularly you can buy a year pass to save money."
"Very clean with waterfront view of the sunset. Picnic tables on site, and ski rental in winter. Great place to bring the kids, trails leading into the woods are great for long walks and you can spend the day wandering from one beautiful spot to another. Parking is a bit expensive around $8 but worth the visit if you spend some time."
"Nice picnic place with friends , family and your dear ones..."
"Cap St Jacques is a huge green space for walking, picnic and even beach! Dogs are allowed on leash, big parking lot, beautiful walking trails. Parking does have a fee of 9$ though, but it's worth it for a long day enjoying the sun and the outdoors"
Beautiful and quiet. Would suggest wearing crampons with boots as ground is very icy with thin snow cover. Walking stick also helped a lot
Does not say dogs are not allowed in the beach area. Waited for 2 hours just to leave.
"Overall nice place but needs some love and maintenance from the city. The city is very efficient collecting for parking and giving out tickets but not so much maintaining paths, fixing tables and parasol."
"First time here, we loved it and very clean also we enjoyed our time in the beach üèñ best recommendation if you want to make BBQ with your family and friends"
"Nice park, cute little beach, quite crowded at times. A good place for kayaking, okay for swimming when season permits. Overall an amazing place just close to the city of Montreal ;)"
Quite busy as it s in the island of Montreal but very nice xc skiing .over 10km of paths.
A very nice place for a cabin trip actually. People are so nice there. Perfect for sugar shack trip.
"Actually I love the place, just think that during a pandemic and no where else to go that the government is still charging parking."
Nice trails for hiking ir biking
"Ok park on the island of Montreal. Everyone should go at least once. My issue with the park is this. People pay to get in yet it does not seem like they invest in anything. When you follow the trails you are mostly on lonely pathways that mostly do not border the water so you are.not getting nice views. Some places are paver, some are not. I was pushing a stroller and let me tell you this place is NOT stroller friendly, especially once you have to get through some wooded areas. You are constantly counting rocks and roots from trees. The park does have a few nice slots to picnik but it's not really worth it. The farm has a few animals but nothing spectacular. The park has potential but I think that day will never come."
"The value of pi, to 6 decimal places, is 3.141596 if I remember correctly"
"Pretty good walking (not hiking) path, especially if you want to just have a walk with kids and family, not the best if you are energetic and don't mind a bit of challenge!"
It was amazing. Organized and the trails were really great.
I am in love with this place ‚ù§
Beautiful parc. Great for snowshoeing too. There is a possibility of renting snowshoes and cross country skis.
"Great place. Not overly crowded when you go early. Avoid the weekends, as it packed and you will need to line up to get in. The beach has a max capacity of 1000 people. Once the beach is full, they shut the gates and turn you away"
"Nice place to swim, warm water, come early"
This natural park is great! Beautiful for nice long walks. You can also enjoy the farm and the beach!
Nice place to chill and relax!
"Nice sandy beach, refreshing water to swim in and the lifeguards are all kind and dedicated to their work. It's always clean, always busy and always a summer classic in Montr√©al. You might want to get in early, the closest parking lot does fill up. If it does a short walk is required, no crazy hiking, a cooler on wheels and strollers make it easily. 19$, entrance for two alduts and parking."
Well kept abundance of walking and bike trails..Fa fall colours all over many small picnic grounds for families to enjoy their day the farm was partially open
It‚Äôs an awesome place to hangout with family and friends just need to be sure to reach early
Lots of space in the early morning.  Trails well groomed.
Beautiful and calming place to take a nice long walk.
Great classic cross country ski trails
"Close to Montreal city before all bridges. Spacious and clean. Many activities such a great beach, fishing, kayak, bike and others"
Lovely place. Try to go during week days as it might get busy on weekends.
Place is really beautiful and can spend some time with your family.... must visit place.
It's really natural with the beach! Good place for pinic
The park is beautiful. The cross country ski trails are very well maintained. The parking is a bit pricey
My first time was good
Nature at its most stunning in the fall  Hard to believe this is on the island of Montreal away from urban areas. Can still imagine horse-drawn carriages on the narrow Gouin boulevard to get here.
"Do not recommend looks rundown because of covid and lack of services, yet they are still charging for parking at a park."
"Nice place for bbq and have a swim with a view. A bit Crowdy on week end, because this is when parents with children are coming. I would suggest them to extend the area authorized to swim. Beside that, it is a cool place hang out."
"Nice place, nice beach... close to Montreal, but no activities and no food places"
If you need to get away from the hussle and bussle of life this is the place for you! Peaceful and tranquil paths through the forest is all you need to find inner peace
"Great place for a picnic, BBQ, you must bring your own BBQ, there are no pits. Paths are great for bike ride or nature walk. Nice trails with water views for bird watching. Public washrooms and very helpfull information desk.
Unfortunately you have to pay for parking.
Also, If you don't see this sign, you are not at the same park."
"Amazing, beach in summer, cabane a sucre in spring, lots of trails to walk, bike, sky.... Lots of things to do all around the year."
"Excellent trails for walking with a stroller, a great spot for a picnic on a hot summer day.

Pay the extra $2 for all day parking, you'll definitely want to stay more than two hours."
"A part of the beach was unaccessable, and not much other spots available to have access to the water. Kind of crowded. But definitely a very nice place with a nice view!"
"Great place for cross country skiing, you can rent equipment there"
"Very busy , beautiful  by the water and plenty to do"
We had such a good time. I have 2 kids and we did the hike then the beach. Worked out perfectly.
"Great day at the beach!
The beach itself is very children friendly and my toddlers were able to play without any worry. As an added bonus there is a lifeguard on duty at all times.
The port-o-potties were surprisingly clean and devoid of smell, which was a great added bonus.
At 11am there was still plenty of room but by 2pm it was pretty packed on Sunday so arrive early to get a good spot!
All in all a pleasant experience at a decent price. Will redo for sure."
"Pretty good beach, the water is murky but very smooth to walk in and there are several picnic tables to sit at if you want to bbq. Its decent and close if you live in MTL"
Parking for the whole day 9.95$
Nature at his best park very well-maintained direction maps everywhere real honesty amazing
"We went on a Tuesday and it was not too crowded, which is nice, but most of the trails were closed and the other nice little beach was closed, so a little disappointing. The water is very shallow at the beach, but it's great for a beach on the island."
Water is dirty...and rocks. Full of rocks. Not that good...but refreshing on hot days .
"Very nice place to walk, have a picnic and having a break."
"A large park. Some pretty views of the river with some benches for viewing. Most of the trails involve a view of trees, and lots and lots of grasshoppers. some mosquitos in less trodden tracks. A small beach is available for a 5$ or less fee. A decent day trip in montreal that is accessible by stm."
"Beautiful, Gorgeous. Only thing is... where do they want us to park."
Access to the main sandy beach area was blocked by Police (i guess due to over crowd). We tried two other spots but were rocky and could not enjoy much. Advise go early if you want to visit sandy area.
"Small  place
Peace  place
I feel  peaceful"
Nice and cozy beach
Area itself is great.  Dislike the fact that the parking meter doesn't take change.
Great place to go with family and friends
"Great outdoor park. Perfect place to spend hot summer days here. There are an access to the river where you can explore the riverside, a picnic area, little farm with animals and vegetables. You are allowed to do barbecue. There is also a path to walk in the nature. The territory is huge, so plenty of space for everyone!"
Went for a hike... very beautiful and peaceful place.
"We organized a corporate event there and everyone absolutely loved it. Their facilities are fully equipped and the beach was the perfect setting for our yoga activity!
They also have many walking trails and a little farm (which I'm disappointed we didn't get to see).
If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city,  go visit. It's well worth it!"
Lots of police (thank you for Montreal Police) people are parking everywhere and anywhere) and non locals taking locals parking... people pay for your parking it‚Äôs not free... the beach can accommodate 1000 people only so be prepared to walk or take the bus! And please pick up your GARAGE!
Peaceful place with amazing view and very nice Beach during summer nd a nice farm with animals for babies to explore
#peace #calm#nature#fun#friends#love
Great sandy beach with a beautiful view. Make sure to be there for the sunset.
Really nice trails. Good for families too-many bring their portable bbq's.
Beautiful park
Great cross country ski.
Nice place for biking and walking but for the beach it's crowded so were not allowed to go in.
"Nice and big park, but don‚Äôt forget to take with you anti-mosquito spray!"
Great small eco farm to discover
"This review is for the beach:  Crowded, loud music everywhere, lots of smoking, drinking and stinky coal BBQs.  Not sure what the park rangers are getting paid to do here. If you are looking for a peaceful day at the beach, don't come here."
"While it carries the distinction of being the largest nature park in Montreal,  the very remote location of this park will discourage most from visiting. If you have a car and if your children are clamoring for a trip to the beach, this park will not disappoint you. Having once been agricultural farmland, this park has the distinction of having an ecological farm."
"My favourite nature park on the island, not too big but big enough to feel away from the city , nice views and easy trails"
Brilliant place for x-country skiing!
Nice spot for a picnic with the family with the added bonus of a farm with barnyard animals to feed and pet
Beautiful place and the chance we got to go to the beach on a hot day was sweet... it cost us 5$ per adult and 0$ for a 4 year old & $9.50 for parking... was worth it...
We have lots of fun every time we go there. Love it!
"Great place for a  getaway in the city. Park is clean and beautiful. The beach is a bit small so I like to go in September when there are fewer people there.  Price is per car so pack up the family in one car. There is water craft rentals like kayaks etc. There are picnic tables around the property but not on the beach. Nice walking and bike paths. Also, there are outdoor toilets. The sunsets in September at 7 pm are Outstanding!"
"Everything was fine, except the washroom that's got closed at 5pm! :)"
Beautiful clean beach and very family friendly. My kids enjoyed the type of sand and some people get really creative.
It is nice
You dont need  to go out of town to see nature..it's just beautiful! ‚ù§ I highly recommend!!üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
A great place spend the day in winter and summer. Really enjoyed snow shoeing on the trails through the park.
"Needs some attention from the administration to be equipped with toilettes and running water in the Beach.
Other than that, it is an amazing place to spend time"
Absolutely beautiful.  Highly recommended.
"Good area, good beach, cheap and accessible. No place to buy food and limited bathrooms"
"It's a nice spot all year - walking, biking, skiing, water activities. Parking pricing is a bit too much, yearly pass makes more sense. It's dog friendly park, sunset can be spectacular, plenty of activities for kids. It can be also overcrowded on a good day, especially picnic areas."
Nice park. Clean. Easy access to water without going to the beach. Dogs can swim (not sure if allowed but it's not prohibited either). Parking is a bit steep but you can park outside in residential area and walk or ride bicycle in.
"A solid place to go to check out the small farm/see some animals (it was super hot and sunny so they were feeling a bit lazy, understandably). But the beach was nice as well, just make sure to go on a day that's less likely to be busy if you can, otherwise it will be super overcrowded and you'll barely be able to sit, let alone Wade into the water. Not much staff on site that I saw in any one place. Though they did have a lifeguard so that's always handy."
Worth the visit and the pleasant stay!
"We went to the beach, the sunset was amazing to watch, would certainly recommend ;)"
"I brought a friend of mine here who never knew this place existed. Very nice. Today was off season, so there were not very many people here. Parking costs $7 for 2 hours or $9 for the day. I wouldn't come here during the summer, because it's probably crazy busy. Nice beach."
I had a blast. It was my second time cross country skiing. Some of the trails were under construction. The food at the chateau  was delish!
Beautiful place in all seasons
"Lovely place for walks and picnics, the dogs aren't allowed on the beach though !"
Nice place to visit. A little too  crowded though
Beautiful park.
Nice little beach. Hopping people keep it clean and respect nature.
"Great place for a picnic and a walk by the water, with a bonus of some animals that's kids loved"
The beach is clean. Good place for your family. Has life guards. Boat for rent. Showers and portable toilets. 5$ per person plus 9$ for parking
Super nice
Beautiful place
"Very nice packed walking routes around the whole nature park! As well as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Parking is a little bit expensive(7.50$ for 2 hours and 9.50$ for the day), most residents have a yearly pass though."
Such a great place for a nature walk .
"The grounds are dirty, the water access is not safe, full of sharp stones, the toilet is very dirty, no sewer system, only hole in the ground."
"Beautiful & wonderful Place for who enjoy walking, hiking & picnic near montreal & West Island."
Lots of ppl now that its open. Thankfully theres a lot of benches and tables near the beach.
They've got some beautiful cows
"An amazing place to hike, have picnic and swim. There are bathrooms and picnic tables and stuff."
"Now the beach is closed, it is nice and quiet place„ÄÇ"
Good enough to walk backwards
"A superb beautiful place, its calm and serene quietness. you need a bicycle to have detailed visit, i specially love this area of benches, its nice place to catch fishes, have dip in water.
This natural environment is superb."
Very beautiful üòç
"Hike trail along the forest,gives you a feeling of remoteness from city life..Beach is restricted now with a cap of 1000 visitors.."
Nice place to visit and go with family.
"It was alright. Too many broken branches and debris from the spring floods. Not sure if it's been cleaned yet. Water temperature was good. Only 1 bathroom, temporary installation. No place to wash hands."
Good beach to spend a summer day with kids.
Nice place to take hikes. Lots of frogs by the river. The farm area is a nice place to go and sit at. The family all had fun.
Beautiful and the paths are really well marked
"Amazing parc, any season, this is 12 months a year full nature friendly. Be prepare to be amazed."
Love cross country skiing here in the winter. Great scenic trails close to home!
Nice parc. Great for biking and hiking.
A beautiful place and the staff were great! Had a great time skiing.
A great and nice place for enjoying the nature in the city.
The park and beach are well kept. On this particular evening we went there for Yoga on the beach #YSP2019 and it was a crowd of about 200 people during this well organized event doing yoga on the -caused by the recent floods- immensely decimated beach. What an awesome experience. Well done City of Montreal!
Beautiful for leisure walking
"Nice park. Lots to see, nice trails."
Great experience during winter & summer
the natural clay at this beach is am amazing mask!
Awesome place to walk and enjoy the beautiful nature. Amazing views of the lake and trees.
It has a good view and good balcony.
Just ok... with the covid restrictions i can't say for sure
Beautiful park.. beautiful beach.
A small get away from crazy city life minutes away.
"Beautiful site with many nature activities. There is a bus stop at the main entrance and access is free. (If you take a car, parking is 9$ for the entire day.)"
Beautiful place to walk and relax
Was relatively clean but nowhere to wash your hands after bathroom. Very crowded. Nicely organized food truck. Had vegetarian option :)
Gorgeous
"Great beach not too far from downtown Montreal. Can get fairly crowded on busy days, but still comfortable for the most part.

Water is very high right now so beach is a lot smaller than normally."
Love the lake side parc. Naturally preseved and so amazing on a sunny day. Need some improvements but worth going
Great plce to enjoy a blue summer day!
"Nice little beach with beautiful views, good biking and hiking trails. A hidden gem in Montreal!"
"Super nice location, not far.from.city. plenty outdoor activities whatever the season."
Great park to have a walk
"The park itself is gorgeous with lovely trails to follow and great cool air to breathe instead of the sweltering fumes of the city. Some fascinating ruins to see of old England style walls that used to separate fields. Clearly a portion of the park used to be farmland a long time ago. Lots of poison ivy so be careful and watch your step, but if you stay on the trail you should be fine. The beach is a bit of a disappointment, a tiny kiddy pool basically and all the BBQ pots have been removed, but it's still gorgeous if you go on a calm day without people crowding it."
Excellent place to spend some ours with family.
Super place with family! Many lifeguards around lake. Kids can play on safety.
"Great beach, accessible by public transit. You can get away from the city in 30-45 min. A jewel on the island out of sight of the high rises."
Very nice park‚ÄºÔ∏è
Worst hiking spot. So much closed trails and detours. But enjoyed the bio farm and fishing spot!!!
Nice beach with all sorts of trails in the woods. 2 life guards on duty during the day. Nice place for everyone.
Nice place for me and my family
Nice
"Picturesque view, good vibe"
Fresh air and lovely grounds and animals
Good mood
"Beautiful parc with nice spots to set up a barbecue and eat! Beach was a little crowded but really amazing water! To avoid waiting a long time in line to park in the parc, park at the parking lot that‚Äôs 20 minute walk away. Same price and you won‚Äôt have to wait to start your day!"
No much ppl due to covid19
"First time in quite a few years that I‚Äôve been there and most of it‚Äôs closed down because of combination of flooding and COVID-19, but still made a pleasant change from walking around the streets of downtown."
Dirty and crowded
You will love it if love sunset
Excellent natural park with activities in winter and summer time! Driving to the park will take few minutes especially for those who are living in the West Island.. A family visit with the kids and for those who love the nature is highly recommended .. And if there is any suggestion to make it better is to add more detailed maps and directions of the park..
A great place to walk and enjoy the water and forested areas.
Went twice and both the times th entrance was blocked by the police.
You can rent cross country skis and boots here. Good maintained tracks of various length. Chalet with tables and a fire place.
Cap St Jacques is a beautiful winter park! (I rarely go in the summer so can't rate that). Perfect for Cross-country skiing with a good choice of different courses which can also be adapted by adding on or removing loops. Perfect for beginners since it's pretty flat. Very nice views of the lake from Red and Blue course
Great place for a family piknik
Serene place in montreal!
"Beautiful place to visit summer or winter for walking, snowshoeing, skiing, tobogganing, kayaking and more!"
Very calm and beautiful
Great location to visit by the water. Wash rooms are available and lots of parking space. Very clean and lots of chairs. For most parts you can not bbq.
Beautiful
very peaceful and there is a petting zoo that is awesome for kids
"Cute small beach, very family oriented atmosphere. Loved the farm that double as a reintegration program...the vow give amazing kiss"
Nice day trip. Worth your time.
There is a great beach with nice water
"Great spot to do some cross country skying in the winter, and easy hiking in the summer."
"Nature, nature, nature.... But why did they have to put a beton ponton with viewing platform right in the middle of nature??? Unfathomable."
Love this place
Nice Family place üí™
Great location to visit by the water. Wash rooms are available and lots of parking space. Very clean and lots of chairs. For most parts you can not bbq.
"you're in the wilderness here, then you remember you're still on the island of montreal!"
It‚Äôs a very chill place. Nice for picking and noise free
Nice park for families
Went to the beach section it's a really nice medium size beach. Lots of annoying rules but everyone ignores lol... definitely worth going  back again.
"It is a great place to visit by bike or go swimming at the beach. Along gouin blvd west from St-Jean blvd. Or St-Charles blvd. The road on gouin blvd. Is not the best with cracks and holes which are dangerous, especially cars going over the limit speeders. However, there are bike paths good enough and you can go south on L'anse des L'orme road to the route 40, have a rest at the strip mall, where there is a Trattoria with amazing cold cuts, sweets, buns, bread and great pizzas to be bought and there is much take out. There is a brand new bike path on L'anse des L'orme going east to Kirkland and St-Charles blvd, easy to follow the hydro poles. But back to Parc-nature du Cap-Saint Jacques you should spend some relax time there, by car or bike."
This park is very beautiful and natural a long the river. Great for morning runs or just a nice family picnic. There is a farm on site that you can visit. Great for grown ups and for small kids.
VERY DISAPPOINTED.....No picnic tables food not allowed on beach ...You have to constantly pack up and go far away to enjoy a snack... life guards should focus more on the people  swimming as opposed to them policing the paying customers... And all the rules should be posted in the entrance in French and English pryer to payment.. never coming here again
Great place to be outside and play with the kids
Great for kayaks and fishing.
"I really like this park, it's accessible in all seasons, cycling, walking, running and swimming during the summer, and yes, there's a beach here :) And skiing, snowshoeing or walking during winter. There's fees for parking your car here and for accessing the beach. Come early if you want to rent cross country skis, they tend to go fast when it just snowed. Also, the ski rental stops at 3PM, and closes at 4PM, so be mindful of the hours."
Nice place to ride a bike. Picnic - family
"It's a small and nice beach but if you don't have a car, you have to walk a good 20 min. They don't put sign to direct us to the place either but overall a good beach."
"There is something magical about this park and I sense spirits here. I had my first date ever here on January 15th, 2005. It is truly a gorgeous and magical place full of wonderful animals and a place to get away. My favorite place in the whole city."
Great distance from laval mtl. Bring the family. Water is hot hot hot.
Awsome nature place for biking
It's a good place to enjoy the water and the sunset. The washrooms are the down side. Very bad.
Great!
"My kids enjoyed the beach very much. Not too crowded unlike St Zotique. Here, the kids can play soccer or run on the sand with a lot of room. I hope not a lot of people discover this beautiful jewel so it will always be quiet. To all complainers, please don't come back."
"A perfect little Sunday escape. It have miles and miles or trail to run, walk or ride. There is a swimable beach, grill spots and  many areas for picnics by the water. Other attractions include a working farm that you can do tours of, all these trails convert to ski and snowshoeing trails during the winter and in the spring there is also a sugarshak on site..... It's a great spot year round if you need to escape from the city but don't want to drive for an hour or more."
"Great place to take a walk, run or bike. Can get busy on weekends,  but during the week it's quiet. Nice bike trails through the woods. Lots of great scenery.  Buy a parking pass, the daily rate is crazy."
Nice trails maps are a bit sketchy.  Parking 7$ for 2 hours(a bit pricy imo) 9$ for whole day.
Great site. Farm and beach are nice to visit and spend the day with family.
"Loved the beach. Perfect size. Close to the city. The water was warm the beach was clean. Great for kids, as it's not very deep."
"They have beautifully groomed cross country skiing trails during the winter. However, if you plan on renting equipment, make sure to get their before 3pm since all equipment must be returned by 4pm"
"I like the place, my kid as well, but something disappoint me on my last visit. It was Sunday around 6pm we just want to have a little walk. The parking was min 2h / 7$ anyway but it turn out that the farm was locked, closing at 5 Sundays, at the end we cannot wash hands and go to the toilet because it was also locked. It is not easy with kids if basic thing like a wash room is not available. So why they charge parking after 5pm sunday if everything is locked!?"
Great place for outdoors activities inside Montreal Island
"Love this place for relaxing, sunbathing,  swimming,  playing and enjoying a beautiful spring, summer or fall day or night.
Bring a guitar and some friends and make it memorable.
Absolutely worthy place to make a weekly gathering of friends and/or lovers.
This is a must for any lover of nature.
Summertime is the time and place to come here and enjoy the ""sand, sex and sun""_ Serge Gainsbourg."
"June 2019, most of the place was flooded and the trails were muddy and wet, not worth the $9 for parking. Should be free parking when most of it is closed due to flooding
Beach is good and trails are good otherwise."
"Good to cycle,  walk,  have picnics etc. Bio farm and some farm animals."
The animals where mostly put away (during april) so it os a bit empty. Walking along the farmhouse and lake was nice and relaxing
"This is a great park with Skiing, tobogganing, snowshoeing in winter and great paths for walking running and biking in summer. Can't wait to try the beach again this summer"
Great place for families to go and enjoy the outdoors. There's many different trails for both racketting and cross country skiing for different levels of ability. I had a great timeüòÄ
A good place to walk with the  family
"Nice, good place to chill, you can even have a barbecue if you wish with the family"
"Love this place. It has trail for walking, beach and place for BBQ"
Lot of freaks
"A great place for a family outing. They just opened a covered terrace, heated, with picnic tables, on the farm, for families that want to bring their lunch. The park is big with many trails, always well groomed."
"I took my own inflation boat. One guy told me I can use it. but when I put It in water, 2 persons came to me and told me based on some rules I can't use it. They told me If I pay $25 rent fee to rent their boot, Then I can use mine. So the rules just for making money."
Great and beautiful  üòç
An area full of nature. Plenty of tracks for walking. Good place for fishermen
Wow nice place
"We went for a winter field trip. There was a scavenger hunt, nature education area, and very large obstacle course spread throughout the park. It was a *little* advanced for kindergarten kids, but that meant they had to stretch a bit. Grade 1 and 2 kids also found the obstacles challenging.

In the summer, this park also has a beach and presumably a wide variety of birds."
Excelent for the family
"Always a treat to spend time at Cap Saint Jacques.  Depending on the season there are different activities to take.  The last visit was for cross country skiing and they have some nice groomed trails.  They are not too hard, but allows you to choose the distance.  The cabane √† sucre on the middle of the 10K trail is a great so for the kids to get a hot chocolate and snack before finishing the run.  We were too early for the Taffy, but maybe next time."
"My favourite place to cross-country ski on the island of Montreal! Good grooming, lots of parking. I buy an annual parking pass and always get great 4-season value for my family."
Nice place
An escape into the nature not far from the city
A rare gem. Great place to bike to. Love the farm. Great for a family outing.
"Best outdoor place for the whole family. Good for hiking,fishing,a small BBQ and they have a small farm ."
"A lovely beach with warm, shallow water.  The perfect Oasis to escape with friends and family on a hot day.  So close to the city!"
"Great place to go for a walk, ride your bike or get away into the woods for a bit but still stay on the Island."
"Ok beach. Water was full of tiny dead fish, they didn't smell, but it was still pretty gross."
It was wonderful. The only thing i was disappointed the washrooms was open until 5 pm . and after 5 pm was hard for kids that couldn't use washrooms.
Had a corporate event here. Parc team was very helpful yet call back time sometimes were a bit long. We had some animation needs and the Team provided great activities for our team.
Visited the beach. Hsd fun with the kids.
"Great walking, snowshoeing and x-country ski trails in the winter and great walking trails the other three seasons. Picnicking and beautiful chalets with comfy fireplaces."
Very good place for easy hikes and snowshoeing
"Great place for a quiet get-a-way, nature-lovers paradise. For a few hours walk in the park, on the beach or cycling the trails this is the place for you.
If you are thinking; overnight or weekend get-a-way, there are modern well-kept accommodations. Stayed for weekends with our church group, we had a whale of a time. Note; mosquitos are an issue, be prepared."
"Info on website not accurate..
Stated 7am-8:30. Instead we had to wait for 10am.
No longer allowed to eat or drink on the permises..quite annoying"
Was fun to see my son recognize farm animals but there was a lot we didn't end up seeing because we got there late.
It's a very nice beach with a lot of space and good services. Nice place for a walk or run
A hidden gem we discovered this summer. The price is right and the beach is very family friendly with lifeguards everywhere
"Do not go to this park,
If you do not like Beautiful nature,
If you do not like to listen waves of water,
If you do not like to enjoy the Maple Syrup and sugarshack.
If you do not like to spend time peacefully with green trees, cute animals ( Bunnies, Cows, Horses, and Donkeys )

I love this activities, so I had an amazing time :)"
"Good to have near Mtl. Nice place of nature, but it tend to attract people who don't know how to behave and respect."
"The beach is nice, can be a bit noisy"
"Lovely natural park with activities in winter and summer! Snow shoeing, kayak... so much to do while still in the island of Montreal"
Great for walks.
Nice place to get away for a walk or quiet time any time of the year
"dusty Parking, beautiful place, take care when you go in water i cut my foot with big sharp stone in sand,"
really nice. water was surprisingly warm.
It is nice place to stay
Alot of fun if you come prepared
"Nice place to rest and enjoy the cool water. Not too crowded, at least on Saturday afternoons"
"It's a great time if the weather is good. The beach is great, and there are picnic tables just off the beach for lunch."
Stop at the wecoming center for trails map. So much to see. I have been going there for 64 years. I learned to swim on the premise public beach. Now you can go with public transit.
It's beyond the words
Lovely park! The trail along the River off of Guoin is great for bicycling and there are picnic areas perfect for a lovely lunch in a beautiful setting.
Smallish beach. Good for a quick beach trip.
Great to see the sunset
Good venue for a (swim run) race!
Great place on the island of Montreal to see nature and water. Place that would benefit from a better landscape planning and flora management.
"Great park and easily accessible. Remote, yet so close to the city. Love walking the summer and xc skiing in the winter."
Super quiet and great view and clean beach. One of the best beach in Montreal
Nice picnic place
Beautiful park. Perfect for hiking and dog friendly. The beach is awesome too. Quiet and clean with life guards.
What a lovely sanctuary of green space on the west island of Montreal. I always enjoy visiting the Park.
"Good place to hang out, has everything one needs but just the water is missed with mud a bit"
"Nice farm. Otherwise, great way to spend time in nature"
"Beautiful place, worth spending the day with the family here. PLEASE Keep it clean though. You're a dark dark soul if you leave your trash here. The devil will eat you."
"Loved the nature walk, my first place to visit when I come over to visit family."
Beautiful park!
Too many people at the beach in summer. Great for long walks. Great for bird watching
Parking is a tad far and they charged us $33 for two cars and three people. Do yourself a favour and go to a free Ontario park/beach.
"Very relaxing place, nice for small groups and families"
Beautiful place to Cross country ski. Inexpensive. Fun. Many trails. Love the place.
One of the most beautiful natural parcs of Montr√©al. You can enjoy hiking or skiing on every season.
Love this park. Amazon ski trails in winter and new CE place for a walk or bike. And there is security
Very nice place and only 45min from montreal
"Swim all summer here with kids,doing BBQ,would advise to buy a family pass for the year otherwise parking is not free."
"Beautiful park, we like to bike there and have lunch by the water. Gorgeous!"
"Amazing park, i bike through the trails and to the beach often. Theres a gpod 10-13 km of trails in the woods you can enjoy.

I'd give it five stars if they cleaned the trails tho, theres a spot near the viewing platforms thats full of debry thats hard to bike over without a montain bike"
"A hidden gem for people wanting to take a nice relaxing walk through the woods, bring their kids to a small petting zoo (farm animals), or fire up the bbq by the water! Don‚Äôt forget to pay the parking or you will get a ticket. Also bike friendly, and has a private beach (for an additionnal cost). You will forget you‚Äôre in montreal"
"Great place to go swim in nature on a very hot summer day, and so close to the city."
"Nice relaxing place in nature, however expensive compared to other places. For 2 adults and parking cost us 19$"
Beautiful place
"Very nice place for a little adventure. We came here by bike and got to feed all the farm animals, it was great."
That water is shallow so it's a great place to bring the whole family :)
"Good XC skiing .  No hills but nice natural, well-groomed trails."
Beautiful place to spend the day. Not too far away from hectic downtown Mtl (20 min drive). A good get away. The only downside is how expensive the parking is!
"Nice park next to the water: good for picnics next to the river, hiking, and swimming in the cleared off section of water by the beach. Signs are a little incoherent and it isnt obvious how/when rules are applicable."
"Nice park with beach and places for BBQ.  Smaller than Oka, but less people. The only thing makes me uncomfortable is about the toilets, very dirty and smelly. So drink less water and have fun!"
"Quiet, well maintained...easy access...trail-marking could be better but over-all nice nature park close to the city"
"A nice oasis in the far-flung area of Montreal. Not the cleanest beach (water-wise), but it's wide, not too crowded off-season, and relatively safe."
Good parc
Great place to take my dog for an outing.
Beautiful natural oasis for an afternoon of fresh air!
Parking capacity was low. It was very busy. Water was very polluted by mud ...
Awesome
"Beautiful in the winter for skiing, snowshoeing, and hiking. I love the chalet by the sledding hill."
Great place for a winter hike. Breathtaking views on the lake - see my pics!
"Amazing place , heal your spirit , i felt i am in cast away movie :) ... i recommend fir everyone"
Place was okay but didn't like that the beach and eating area are seperate... Also the water isn't clean...
"Excellent nature area for whole family,picnic,bbq areas available,fishing beach.Parking is by two hour or a daily fee.Easily accessible by car or public bus.Year round place for fun, relaxation, fitness."
Very nice and cool place for summer camp for your kids ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Nature haven in the west island great for cross country skiing and light trail running.
Nice Park
"Went to the Embouchure Park. It was very clean. The only thing i found dagerous and a ciment post with metal pole sticking out, if anyone trips 8t will he  disaster especially for kids some should remove i tut or cover it."
"Plenty of space to walk,run,fish,picnic and observe animals."
Was a much better place years ago. The Farm feels falling into disrepair recently and often see litter everywhere. It is quite a shame honestly.
Fantastic
Nice park and beach
Lots and lots of fun. .great beach...great fun for the kids
Nice sandy beach
Lots of trails. Roads to cycle. Beaches.
Make sure that you have change or credit card handy for 9$ parking charge
"We celebrated there my son birthday, amazing place next to the water. We can find even a small farm and animals there"
A fun day in the sun. Find it rather expensive. 19$ for 2 adults and to park one car. Crazy.
"Fun for the kids, easily a 30min visit including walking from parking, see a few animals and back"
love this place for a walk or all sport its just perfect !!
"It is all right, not in a hurry to go back anytime soon."
"27,50$ for a season pass to the beach? That's just awesome."

Nice beach. A bit pricey but worth it.
Very nice family park. Walking trails and beach
"It was a pleasant walk and the beach was nice however it's very filthy. Dirty diapers and beer cans everywhere, garbage floating around in the water..They should have someone go around and clean up once in a while."
Beautiful trails for snowshoeing!
Awesome park for cross country skiing. Nice trails and chalet.
Beautiful park. Nice trails.
Went snowshoeing. Was hoping there would be something to do at the barn/farm area but there was not. Trails were well maintained but scenery wasn't terrific.
Beautiful park and bike trails.
The view is good. But no work stuffs are working. The bathroom is also locked.
Good
So much to see and do!
"THEY CALLED BEACH ? ??please dont go!! We went to the beach on july 4 2017 and i got really  grossed !!Half of the beach was under water,sand  very dirty,lifeguard sitting on the chair surronded by water .garbage,feathers,whi te particules like toilet  paper floating in the water.Smelly and yellow water.terrible smell coming from the outhouses.My son cut is finger on a piece of glass in the water and we paid 22.dollars to spend a day surronded by garbage?  i dont understand why the ville de Montreal doesnt close this beach  in this conditions!The health board should come and see...Its a slap in the face for people in the west island living with low income that the only place they can go is Cap st Jacques!20 YEARS AGO     we had a navette from the entrance to the beach, we had Chateau Goyer a small restaurant,we had a small drinking fountain, an outdoor shower for sandy feets and overall serious and caring lifeguards checking if you had  wine or beer and telling people to get out if they didnt respect the rules...Now we have people having sex in the water,smoking pot and drinking beer and also a dirty beach???and being charged  $9.00 for parking. 10.00 for  2 adults and $3,50 for an 8years old kid?Ridiculous!!Is the last time i will go with my kids,i am from pierrefonds and i used to come every year with my family but i care about our health and until i dont see any improvement i will not go."

"Went to the Parc and was trying to pay for parking. Network failure trying to pay with card and was told to find cash because even though they have a problem if not I will get a ticket. Phone number transfers you to a answering machine with no help at all. Welcome to Montreal politics, even though it's they're fault they will still try to find a way to blame you."
Overcrowded and very small authorized swimming area. Bad experience.

"Is the beach a joke ??? How can they call this tiny place a beach ???
The restrooms are dirty and stinky as hell !
And why paying for a parking when no service at all ???"
Beautifull place
The view of sunset wasn't obvious because the trees were hiding
Amazing Park minutes from Beaconsfield.
"dogs off leashes...no security...all in all, a frightening experience!"
"Many paths closed or poorly maintained, as well as all food services. Signage and maps out of date, and official English website gives drastically different information from French site."
Best beach around Montreal
I love this park and especially the beach
Most beautiful spot on the Island of Montreal!

"Bel endroit, tables √† Picnic, tes calme."
"This is an amazing environmental project that has earned many prices. It is amazing what they did - transforming a dumping ground into a beautiful urban park (that will be ready in 2025), and transformig the methane in energy through rhe spheres."
"Very beautiful place in montreal. You can walk, run and many other things. I recommend you can go with your friends and family üëç"
"Great park for running, or biking around the 6+ km track. 1 hrs approx to walk around.. Access to skate park, soccer pitch, baseball field and Nice picnik tables in the center and always changing. The city is doing a great job on the park. Work still in progress and will be nice once completed"
"We call this spot Bawls Pawk, pronounced with a Chigoan accent...there‚Äôs lots of space here, might be a wicked good spot to take a trip in. Lots of green space, paths, trees...oh, and there‚Äôs bawls too"
Very cool place! Happy to see the city turned a landfill into something useful and strangely beautiful. Visiting this park you truly do feel like you're landed on another planet. 5 stars!
"Even on a busy day, everyone of ALL ages and skills levels are safely having fun ‚úå"
"Absolutely beautiful park, well maintained trail, and more than enough room to take a walk while remaining at a safe distance from others."
Really nice place to discover. Looking forward in returning this summer
"A park convenient for snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and taking a walk. It‚Äôs a huge landfill site so plenty of room to roam around. The parking lot is very small so it might be full depending on if you are lucky. It‚Äôs the park near TOHU (cirque d‚Äôun soleil) do they have interesting art pieces around the park"
Nice pictures and great view all around!! Takes about 1:30 around so walk it twice!! Amazing workout.
"Nice park located in north of montreal. You can walk, run and many other things. I recommend."
Amazing walk. Perfect way to enjoy nature
I went there to cross ski...the trails  are terrible every now and then but nevertheless it is a gorgeous spot in the city; I love this parkü•≤ü§ç its a 4 seasons spot.it never stops to amaze me
Great place to have some clean air. I'm lucky to live right next to this beautiful area.
"Great park for running, walking and biking. The only downside is that in the past it has smelled absolute terrible (intense smells of garbage juice in certain trails) in the summer months."
Always beautiful and peace‚Ä¶
"It is really a good park joggers, ideal for long walks and suitable for kids"
"This is such an amazing park, gotta be one of the top 5 parks in mtl. It‚Äôs a great place to take a walk, take pictures or just to watch the sunset. Great atmosphere too."
There's amazing stretches and then not so great. I think it has great potential once it's done. Great for running. Not so great for your kids on a bike.
Beautiful park! Love doing my walks.
This is a nice gem hidden from the hustle of the main road.
Beautiful 5km path I run every weekend . But there is a weird plastic smell coming from the industrial .
"I love this park, so good for walking around and biking"
"It's not completely finished but it is a great place for biking, jogging, skating and even to sit and enjoy a meal. The proximity to Papineau street make it a bit noisy sometimes but bearable. It's going to be a 5 star park for sure , once completed with the pool project."
Really nice place
Nice place for a long walk
"Planned evening around visiting this park. Closed. No signs. No mention on the website. Disappointed. Do better, Montreal."
"Beautiful park, very clean!"
Beautiful and quiet area to contemplate nature in the middle of a bustling city. There is also a nice Kid's play area with equipment at the north eastern end.
Great park!! Can't wait for the finish product.
If you want to ride bicycle or long walk then it is perfect place. The fall view is okay.
Land of the Teletubbies ? No. Parc Fr√©d√©ric-Back ...un parc en d√©veloppement . Toute une transformation . M√™me les biogaz sont r√©cup√©r√©s  An environmental engineering feat . From a quarry to a garbage dump to huge urban park in progress.  Even producing electricity from the biogaz. Will be interesting to see the evolution over the years.
Great for long walks. Bizarre place. Mostly flat and easy for walks. Great for joggers.
"Great parc to come walking, running an bicycling in summer around the loop and cross-country skiing in winter! It's well maintened and there's lots of trees and couple view point with bench. When you see the sign Fred√©ric-Back corner 2nd Avenue/Rue Deville just continue straight right until you see a hill, go up the hill and you will have an interesting view with Mont-royal far behind and there's a couple of bench to relax. Love to come here just before sunset, enjoy the last rays of Sun and then check out the sunset with sometimes amazing colourful clouds!üëç"
Love coming back to this place. Great place to smoke and enjoy the views at night.
Love this place. Beautiful park to enjoy a great long walk. It also has a skateboard park (TAZ) and a children area.
"one of montreal great park good for running and watch the sunset and they are making it bigger park it used to be a dumpster back in the 70 now we got soccer field, skateboard place... I believe as the years goes by it will get biger and biger"
Love this park!!! It's huge and really beautiful perfect for taking walks biking pickniks and the sunsets there are always breathtaking
"Amazing 5km run you can do by running all the track . 4 stars because the people biking just goes everywhere they are pleased to go , there should be a lane for them ."
"This barely qualifies as a park. Very little trees. I guess it would be ok for a quick run, but I would not go back."
"I think this is a great place to escape to the nature, without  leaving the city. Connecting sports and cultural centers, this is a place for sportys, family and anyone who wants to relax and  forget city noises. I put 4 stars because is not yet finished."
Three stars until the Tatooine balls are accessible again
"√Ä beautiful park, good for walking and other activities, very safe and clean"
Great place
An excellent urban park. Can't wait for the rest to open!
Many zones are under reconstruction
"Early or later, this 35% open area has its attractions worth High School geography courses. Family meals, bicycle and toddler's hiking wraps up nicely on circus sides."
"Best PARK to do cross-country skiing, running, hiking or just to walk hand in hand with his or her sweet half or default, his Cl√©bart, just have to cover himself well from the north _ east wind"
Beautiful and peaceful.. Love this park
There was a skating path and I saw a $3.2 million house. It's fun to come here
Great place to spend the afternoon exploring
Great little park for chilling. Its big and has a lot of room. It's a bit rustic but great and beautiful.
Great walk and view
"Lovely park! The perfect place for a nice walk with family, friends or even alone. This is very nice what they have made with a space like this, definitely going back for a photoshoot or something another time."
Good
Very nice like it üëåüèø
Favorite park in Montreal!
Very nice parc with beautiful scenery considering is in the middle of Montreal! Awesome how they transformed an old quarry into a beautiful place to walk and bike and enjoy nature. Also fun fact the old decommissioned gas vents are now white balls coated with phosphorus paint that glows when light hits it at night like with a flashlight
"Amazing park apart from the in-progress middle part of it, great for 30 min runs (one lap) and walks."
Beautiful view of the sunset !!
"Once this park is complete, it will be one of Montreal's best. Right now, you can only walk around the park. Looking forward to the completed project."
One of the hidden gems of Montreal! It‚Äôs quite a long distance but I suggest taking a bike or BIXI and go all around the park. Should take about 30min and you‚Äôll have amazing views! You won‚Äôt feel in Montreal for that period.
There is a need for some shaded places to be able to hide from hot sun
Enjoy my daily walks
"Magnificent place, so beautiful, outdoor activities, sport, walk, breathtaking views, you can see Montreal from far , it is a new parc , big one, it took hours to visit it"
"It's a very nice walk, not much for photos."
"Bike path and reindeers.
Nice combo"
It is a  beautiful park
it's still a work in progress. will be great once it's done. good for jogging or long walks.
Love this place to run very quiet and no one bothers you. Full of runners and it‚Äôs really motivating to be there !
The parc is incomplete in some place buts its nice
Very impressive
"Le Taz was lots of fun, I didn't really go to the rest of the park, however there are plans for this park to be developed over the next few years..."
"A giant park, very nice to take a walk or bike through. The industrial sight is actually a nice feature of the park. A mixture of nature and human-made powerhouse."
"Amazing idea to cover the garbage dump site with dirt and make a park. Interesting views of the city in the distance. Not so interesting the park itself, very boring and with instalations."
"Would be quite good for long runs and cycling, but the environmental factor was really disappointing compared to what I expected. Little to see, but good for quiet, long exercising."
"The perfect parc for jogging, as each lap takes around 5 km. Only downside is that it‚Äôs center is not accessible, and quite ugly. I always go there to run or do jogging, but many people also bike there."
"This park is perfect for walking,  biking,  roller blading and picnics.  There are baseball fields,  soccer fields and parks for the children."
"Those white globes instantly reminded me of ""Rover"", the floating guardians of ""The Village"" which was the filming location for the 1967 British television series, ""The Prisoner"". Is it a coincidence that big white balloons were attached to some of these park modules? Hmmm... ;-)"
"Nice big park full of activity and events during summer, perfect for morning runners, family weekends with kids"
"The place is huge and currently a work in progress. An old quarry, garbage dump, with composting gives an area a particular sleek. Strange pods contain gas wells used to power Cirque du soleil and the Tohu I've told. Its a 6 km walk around, once you started there's no shortcut back. A big downside is a recycling plant on the South side. Winds blow paper and plastic trash all over giving you a true garbage dump experience. Along the west side you have Taz and an indoor soccer stadium. Its promising, cant wait to see what it will look like once finished."
"The Parc Fr√©d√©ric-Back, located within the Complexe environnemental St-Michel, is an ambitious environmental rehabilitation project. You can now visit and walk the complete path all around the old ""Carri√®re Miron"" some of the parts were closed for a while when in construction. On the east side weird little balls are set on ground. Very nice place to walk and very different. Surprisingly lots of Wildlife too. Not too  much people either. Parking can be found on the streets near by. Sometimes weird smells coming out from the mountains of compost."
"Great big park, a great place to go for a run or a bike ride in the summer, currently being renivated to make it into a nature park"
This is a lovely park for a 4K walk
Great view from the top and nice long path for jogging.
Best place to take a walk
Great for jogging and the future will include more trails and lake.
So close to home! Love discovering new places for walking!
Great place to run.
"Newly renovated, amazing place to take a stroll"

A good place for a long walk
One of the best park in Montreal
"It's like central park, but without the charm of it. One the plus side, you can barely tell it was formerly a dump."
"Really great space for walks, runs or biking."
The inauguration ceremony is August 26th. Be there
Complexity
Nice
"C‚Äôest mon parc pr√©f√©r√©, au moins 5.5km presque tout le contour plus les autres petits chemins. Parfait pour du jogging, des bonnes marches. En hiver c‚Äôest id√©al pour les glissades et aussi pour du ski de fond. En √©t√© il y a beaucoup de tables de pique nique. Tu peux amener ton chien pour une belle promenade."
Super coucher de soleil üåû
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Lieu atypique encore en chantier. Beaucoup d‚Äôespace √† revisiter une fois le projet termin√©
Really nice place where you can relax in peace. Outstanding.
Nice park
Beautiful place for kids
Surpzingly well equipped
Facilities are not updated
"A quiet park at the end of a street on waterfront overlooking chomedy west, peaceful and clean. It is a place to be away from all the stress of a city.
If you bring a binoculars, you can see Laval pretty good. There is another park at the other side of the river. Also, the river there is a good place to watch birds. I saw a crane flying low on top of the water, but too bad that my camera was not ready. Canada goose and mallards are all over.
You can also play a game or two of lawn bowling if you have company."
Really calm place.
Wonderful
"An historic, preserved site straddling the Lachine Canal and condos. Nice green space to walk by and witness the remains of one of the first local settlements."
"Small parc on the back river believe its called in English V√©t√©rans Parc. Not many picnic tables but some. Good view of the River and can launch a motor boat, but the gate has a lock so should get in touch if you have a boat, with the City of Pierrefonds or City of Montr√©al. Take from Blvd. Gouin then east on Lalande blvd to Parc."
Nice place to spend your time in family ! It's a wild park! :)
"The landscaping here is phenomenal. It also features excercise equipment, youth ""ninja"" playground, shuffleboard, volleyball, a floating dock and has a nearby marina boat launch.  I passed by around 8pm but I'd like to see it in the daytime, but it was well lit. The park had been closed off to public for renovations I think. Glad to see it open and being used by locals. There is also 2 parking lots."
Nice place to hangout with family and friends Very neat and clean.
"Very nice access to the water front. Nice volleyball court. Post Covid there should be nice indoor bathrooms. 2 playset for toddlers with wood chips (no sand, yay!)
Plenty of space"
I visited when the snowy season was on its peak. The whole river was covered with ice..... Beautiful place
Good spot to enjoy sunset by a river with open view.
My kids love playing there
Place to workout and go for a swim after
"Beautiful location, I recommend you go there during sunset üåÜ"
"Amazing place, you should come and see it."
Nice but smells bad
Quiet petit park
"Great place to relax a long with the new playground for kids, including volleyball and marina for boats."
Access to the river with boat launch. Park has excercise station and beach volleyball.
Super good all day long!
It is a good place to see the sunset. The view is great.
Really nice and quite
Nice water view
Need's to be up date' but nice park!
The place is ok. If you go to chill no problem but other than that don't expect the best. The great thing about the park is the view of the water!
Ok
Quiet place to sit by the water. There are benches and tables.
Nice park but busy on weekends and dirty next Mondays.
Nice
Nice place to reflect and relax.
Fun.
Nice view
"Love the park. It's clean, secured and has lots of things kids can play with"
"Kids friendly ,Nice for jogging , football ground is there and lots of trees !"
Great place for kids to play.
Hidden gem!
Cleans practice to walk
Calm park
So so
C'est un endroit tres relax et pas trop grand et surtout pas pleins de gens. J'aime beaucoup passer un apres-midi dans ce parc.
The kids enjoy themselves everytime.
Love it
"Today was a very long and loud day with the family on a sunday so I wanted to go out to get some fresh air with no noise but nature. What a place to go it is so quiet and the water view is fantastic, you can also bring your children to play.
Bring OFF there are a lot of mosquitoes.
Enjoy!!"
"Easy way to the ""back river"" (between the island of Montreal and Ile Bizard)...even for someone like me with bad knees that has to take their time. Beautiful time to visit? Just before sunset! Just an absolutely clear view to gorgeous sunsets. I was there in October and there were still just glorious colors!"
A free place to launch my paddle board into the river. There are a often few rough-looking teenagers hanging out here so doesn't feel very safe.
really nice place....
OK for the odd walk or to have a look on the waterfront when the park is actually opened. It has been inaccessible due to flooding as can be seen in photo and video taken from a hovercraft during Spring floods 2019.
Chill place to hang.
Lovely little park - filled with locals always busy with many kids.
Very small park where you can sit and rest.
"Perfection...love love love it.
Tennis loves! Make here your home‚ù§"
Lovely park with lots of green space and plenty of play structures for the kids. Even has a pool and splash pad
Nice place but gets crowdy like another parc
This park has always been my go to park ever since I was a kid. Very quiet and not too crowded. Tennis courts are available for those who play. Nothing better but to relax there on a sunny day.
"Marlborough is located in a calm neighborhood. The parc is relatively big, and it offers a sand pit, a pool, a tennis court, a basketball court and plenty of surface area.  The pool is more for children ,and families usually come together. No√´l-Nord is located down the road, and it has a bigger pool for adolescents and adults."
"Very nice park, with a pool, basketball court and 4 tennis courts but they closed the lights at the tennis at 10 pm instead of 11 pm, which was frustrating."
It gets very crowded at times. A large gathering of Muslims picnic at the park almost every night and they take up almost the whole park
"Basket ball court, and 4 tennis courts. Big swimming pool and one small pool for babies, water games as well.
Really good park."
"There is a good pool with a park and a tennis field, it includes a small adult pool and a baby pool and a water park."
Very good pool. I love this parc.
"The best park in the world. 2 pokestops and a gym, what more could you ask for. Security usually comes around at 11:30-12"
My mother brought me for picnics and swimming here my entire  life and i brought my children and granchildren ‚ô°
Nice park smack in the middle of a residential area. It has all the amenities and is very clean and modern.
If you go there with your bike make sure lock it well. Mine got stolen
Love that park. Offers Tennis too
Best staff 2019 ! üëèüëè
Lively place
"Clean and spacious park with a great playground, pools, basket ball & tennis court."
"Grew up around here, looks different from back then but I like the change they did."
Great place for kids as well as for adults.
Very nice and quite park..pool is nice too
Very nice place
It's a park.
Great park!
"The swimming pool is not heated, the children had a hard time on swimming classes because of the cold water, specially in the morning if is not a very hot day"
Nice park
Great park
Excellent
Very well maintained
"Swimming pool, tennis court, basketball court, kid playground."
Good tennis courts
"Its a shame how the city is managing this park. Zero maintenance , mud and unleveled ground are a hazard for the kids."
"How do you pronounce the name of the park?
Nice area.  Part of Mount Royal"
Not super accessible but beautiful views of Montreal that we rarely get to see!
"An oasis in the city, with a quiet and roomy lookout. Adjacent to the cemetery to give additional walking areas of interest."
A nice hike to view another side of Montreal. One can walk back from the hidden path to UofM metro in 10 mins.
Nice view
Great little hidden gem in the city. Nice quiet place to go for a walk surrounded by nature.
Very picturesque
Nice views
"Really nice and spacious park. We chose a spot close to the water and had a dance class. Lots of space for everyone to be comfortable for picnicking on the ground or on tables.
The only complaint I had is that there was too much excrement everywhere."
Nice park.
Beautiful and restful.  Lounge chairs and benches available
Good place
Extra!
"I don't know the history of this park or the reason it was built. But it has the feeling of a park created by politicians to get a story in the newspaper about the city creating more parks.

It's only the size of a single or double lot, half of it is covered in poorly maintained stone (which is surprising how close it is to the public works yard down the road), a handful of benches and a small strip of grass. It's right beside a busy road and rather inhospitable. And the fact it's only a block away from a real park, it just doesn't make sense why anyone decided to build this park in the first place. Popular with homeless guys though."
Cute small park with an interesting architecture. Fun for skateboarders and rollerbladers as there are a few structures to use.
"Another of LaSalle's parks in need of a little attention. Impact/landing zones are below grade for CSA standards. Anyone can fact check that little nugget of knowledge by the way, just research it. The equipments been updated over the years so that's nice at least. And this park is wonderfully located near a busy street, and yet still is a nice quiet park. Definitely a park worth taking younger kids too. For the record though, there's not a lot in the nearby area, so if you want to take your kids for ice cream or a treat afterwards, your options are a nearby depanneur, Marash (from what I understand, worth the visit) or hop in a car and go to Place LaSalle."
I love spending time with my son there
It ok great
"Cute little park, a small play ground and a larger one for older kids"
Nice
For the kids to play
Cute park
Very beautiful park with a great and big hockey ring
Nice environment
Clean and nice park. Children can play and swim. Many Thanks to everyone works in this place!
"Not too many people, very clean and lifeguards are excellent"
"A bit dated, but nice sized pool"
My favourite neighbourhood park in St-Laurent.
"Nice pool, modern facilities, never too busy."
"Very fun, family friendly area with a baseball field, swimmimg pool for small children aswell as a pool for older people. It is also accompagnied by a very nice park."
Baseball field is embarrassing.... Looks line a baseball field you would see in a 3rd world country !!
Nice pool
Excellent small park
a lovely place for all
Quiet and nice area
"Simple, quiet park. Nice place to sit on a cool evening."
Tiny park to sit.
Nice for take a few minutes
Nice place !
"Beautiful structures for the kids, ground is covered with a type of outdoor carpet which is great. Plenty of shade"
Large space for puppies to run.  Unfortunately lots of people don't pick up after their pups and the gates are often damaged so they don't close properly.  There are poop bags available and a water fountain.
Very well maintained with dog park and several places to skate for  your kids. Also clear snow to allow easy movement between parks nearby.
"Great dog park, owners that frequent that park are super cool. Highly recommend it."
"People treat the Dog Park like a litter box and never pick up the poop. Some people think the whole park is a dog park so the dogs run around all over the place without a leash.

Edgy teens think it's cool to continuously break beer bottles on the paved paths.... So often it's going outta style. ""Look at me! I grew up in the suburbs but I think I'm in the hood""  GTF Outta Here.

Too many baseball diamonds... Could use a basketball court.

3/5 stars. At least I don't gotta walk my dog on these sidewalkless streets."
"My boys and I really enjoy this park! It has one of the best dog parks that I‚Äôve visited. Very clean, nice shady spots. The maintenance of all installations is spotless. You can ride your bike there and simply enjoy. There are field activities for every season: baseball, tennis, ice skating."
"lovely park and even better dog run!! great place to walk and calm down every morning  or night, baseball fields are well tended too and dogs and people are usually very friendly!! love going there every day!!  staff is hardworking and park is great"
A great park to go for a jog. Peaceful and safe. Less cars and the neighborhood is very nice.
Well maintained with small dog park. Several baseball diamond s and nice tennis courts. Across road decent play area for kids with slides etc. .
Great fot both small and older kids
"Wonderful park with two areas for all ages, lots of room to kick a soccer ball around (or anything else), and close to all kinds of sporting fields, baseball, soccer, tennis. My 7 year old son's favorite park!!"
Great place to play baseball
"Nice place for all kids in the area, well maintained park. It's not as big as some other parks, nice to have place to have in the neighborhood."
A dog park with not too many dogs... also my dog doesn‚Äôt like the granules ground.
Very good for the little ones to spend for an hour. Just the basics.
Great park for baseball
"This park is a stable site in the Pierrefonds Roxboro area on the West Island. If you played hockey, tennis, baseball, lobball, lawn bowling, you know where it is located on brook st.( Between ushaped Harvey st. ), It does not have an exterior swimming pool. Go check out a high talented baseball game, or young ones also enjoying playing baseball this summer, and there is available parking."
Nice park.  Not enough seating.
They recently substituted the sand for carpet flooring. It's still a fun place to take your children just watch out for carpet burns.
Went for baseball game.  The mounds are not correct and the dugout fences are dangerously low
"Nice place for dogs, pebbles instead of sand. However many trees around the park making bugs show up, little sticks and twigs on the ground but would certainly go again!"
Nice park with tennis courts and baseball field. This park has a dog park too.
Good for a little peace and quiet.
Great for kids big and small.
Clean good dog park
great dog park
"Huge playgrounds for kids,"
Best park in the world!
All it's missing is a basketball court too many baseball fields
Very nice park
Excellent parc!
Great place
WE NEED A SMALL TURF SOCCER FIELD PLZ
Small nice park.
"Great park for kids to have fun with water playground in the summer , and for adults to take a walk."
Great for sledding! Just wish people understood that during a pandemic they need to either distance (which wasn't happening) or wear a mask...give the kids a good example!
Great park with lots of play and sports options
"Nice dog park in the Southeast corner of the park (off Ash avenue), only one in the area."
"Very big park, lors to entertain the kids."
Awesome for football soccer baseball and splash pad. Also has a great hill for sledding and snowboarding. Running and jogging. Right across the street from the YMCA.
"Mainly go to the dog park when dog sitting.  The dog park gates need a minor adjustment to ensure they stay closed.   The park has soccer and football fields, outdoor ice hockey in winter, football, soccer, tennis, basketball and a kids splash pad in summer.  The neighbourhood is up and coming and there's a YMCA across the street."
"Huge gigantic park with plenty of space to play and for families to spread out with a blanket in the Sun, not overcrowded with people and there was even a washroom and a water fountain."
It's a fun place for children and their parents.
Nice place to take a walk
Nice quiet peaceful place to go read a book

Awesome very big and friendly!

Recent upgrades in the last few years have really made the park nicer.
Great place.
Nice green space
"Football field, soccer pitch, 365 hockey, amusement park, water park, baseball diamond, handball and 3 on 3 basketball court (NYC street style) this place has it all"
Nice for relaxing

Cest unbeau parc pour famille et sport
I enjoyed the dog park.  It was clean and well maintained. The park also had an enclosed area for smaller dogs. There is also a large parking area reserved for the park.
Nice ground for sport! (Football üëç)
"It's a pretty good place, its quite calm and peaceful, but sometimes it can be quite dirty."
Pretty chill for a downtown park. Has plenty of room for socially-distanced picnics.
I love it is always clean  there is a machines for construction in the path for running but it's space enough for still running
Great parks!
Nice and peaceful place
Nice place to go play hockey in the winter and nice classic summer parküëç
A nice place for games
Great for running. Just too much mud and dirt without grass in my opinion. So your shoes will get dirty.
"Good walking
Stay away from the weirdo s. Not safe at night."
"Well kept turf field for pickup soccer, although most nights during the summer it is reserved for league play. There's also a basketball court and baseball field."
Big park with many tables.
Empty bottles and covers gloves all over degusting

"Pretty park, the sports fields are well maintained and often used by organised sports teams. The runners track is open to all but in bad repair, whwn it rains the puddles in the middle of the track are massive and hard to run around"
"2 Soccer terrains, basketball terrain, volleyball spot, an arena, decent nice small park"

"Green park with small children's pool and separate water playground. Separate grounds for toddlers and bigger children. I suppose the hill will be useful for winter sports during the long winter. Minus-big companies are gathering at evenings and play stupid and loud music at times which might drive you crazy, it can get really annoying."
"Great park for my one year old to enjoy. Excellent splash pad and a couple of playgrounds, one geared toward younger kids."
Dont have BBQ grill but it's a big open place.
"It's a really nice park. You can go in any season of the year. You can have great time here. There is a big area for dogs, there is a Baseball camp. There is Piscine for the kids in summer. There is games for the little ones and a closed one for the more little ones. Is quiet and we have went in family and also with friends."
"Had a blast at the dog park with Lucky,the people are amazing and they took the time to teach me new things."
"Beautiful place to go with family, place to play soccer and baseball."
Very nice park with a large fenced-in off-leash dog area. A great place for your dog to get some energy out.

Lake was filled with snow. I could find ducks still enjoying the melting ice water. It was beautiful feeling to walk around the river intaking fresh air.
Our favorite spot. Clean and the view are super relaxing.
Great vue!
Beautiful small parc to enjoy sunset üåÖ
"As a child of the 60s my heart belongs here. So many incredible memories from my childhood with the soundtrack of Saturday Fever as a backdrop. Walking through the front gates.. salt and pepper shaker ride on the left ,avalanche sleighride on the right  and never enough tickets...rickety old roller coaster at the back with the horses up one side and down the other .. brings a tear to my eye"
"Little but has nice view, cute animals around."
Relaxing view of the river.
A very special place so good to relax and have fun with friends and family.
I‚Äòm almost 62 years of age and I was born and raised in Toronto and thought I would Google Belmont Park that I went to back in Expo 1967 Montreal and up popped Belmont Park today. So I read that the amusement park has been closed since 1983 but it was a total flashback when I was thinking back to when I was nine years old with $.50 I could go on the rides all day long and go crazy! Great memories and that was the one and only time that I was ever in Montreal was for expo. But I‚Äôll never forget Belmont Park.
Nice view
"This is my sanctuary, few people each time staying quiet and relax next to a beautiful bridge and the wind when the summer is at is peak can been seen on the leaves."
Nice place to enjoy the view of the river and sunset
Beautiful park.
Great place to walk around or sit back and enjoy the view on a park bench.
Eventhough it has a pretty sight by the Laval bridge however it smells canaby yuck and people there are low level ... good luck with that !!!
Family picnic and river fishing!
Great
very nice
It's a small parc..but it brings back memories of my childhood at BELMONT PARK...fun rides..the smell of popcorn...hours of fun...
"Great view on the river and Lachapelle bridge, very nice place to relax."
Beautiful and quiet
Awsome park. Nice view on the river. Only downside : mosquitoes...
Love the environment. Peaceful
"Nice quiet place next to the river and bike path torwards the West island on northern part of Montreal island. What is most interesting to me is the historical set up they did as part of Montreal's 375th. They put quite a few panels with pictures, explanations and people's memory of the glorious days off this area when it was a fair in a underdeveloped part of Montreal. Truly amazing. I wish more parcs were providing insight on their past ."
I love this park
Nice simple park with excellent view of the river.
Beautiful spot for viewing the river & boats!
Fun!
Just so many views to photograph.
"A cozy little parc by the ""rivi√®re des prairies"" river ! Offers beautiful views of the Lachapelle bridge and is surrounded by a very up and coming neighbourhood ! Perfect for picnics and evening walks by the water !"

J'aime vraiment all√© faire mon jogging dans cette parc
"Open for skating - due to COVID, skates cannot be lent out; call 48 in advance to reserve a spot"
Small little park here in our community. I hope they will maintain the cleanliness.
Very good park
It is a very small park but only think surprised me is that you can do ice skating with free shoes rental. Not all of the time but you can find some hours in week.
"Good Park, there a fortress to play Harry Potter Wizard Unite, and also a green house for Hsrry Potter... there 1 gym for Pokemon & also a Poke stop"
Great Canadiens foundation rink here with amazing ice quality

Great park but not sure if christopher Columbus should be the highlight. Maybe navigators park but why celebrate someone who killed people... large park and great for the kids.
Love this park. It's well contained making it easier to keep track of a group of preschoolers
Cool
Great parc
Nice quiet little park. Nothing fancy but decent play equipment.
..sitting on a bench to get some air outside without to take the car  away  .
New kids parc.... but bball fields and stands very poorly maintained.
This Park was inaugurated  to celebrate the 500.th. anniversary  of Christopher Columbus . and his first voyage..
Nice spot to jog
Good for young children and toddlers
Nice relaxing place next to the water.
Parc close to my house ! It‚Äôs a great parc !  The best parc !
Love this park! Great for all ages picnics BBQs fishing you name it you can do it here
Relaxing
"La piste cyclable a √©t√© am√©lior√©e quelque peu, c'est un gros plus, il en reste √† faire mais la vue vaut le trajet!"
Nice little hill overlooking a good parrt of the city.
"Very beautiful place. During the Spring, Summer and Fall you can go there for a walk, meditate or just sit and relax; also, good place for a picnic. They have some gym equipments where you can stretch yourself. The playground for kids is a bit limited in terms of numbers of activities (I guess one slide and two sets of swing 4 and 4). During the winter, prepare your board because this park has one of the best toboggan ever, very open, high and long(you can slide for something like 50 meters) Worth visiting"
A beautiful Place. Lovely view from on-top of the mountain
"It's a great him for tobogganing but it was packed with people, which is not ideal in a Covid situation, and people do not reflect any kind of safety recommendations.  People walk straight up the middle of the hill without paying attention to people coming down.  Others stand at the bottom for extended periods of time so you're always worried you're going to sleep into someone when you're coming down the hill."
"There's a lot of people and always going to have people, day and night. If you plan to use the football field, I'd suggest you to come early is super late. It's a good park for a walk or a picnic. You have a nice view of Montreal downtown from the top of the hill and the people respect the environment, no trash on the ground. Good lightning if you go in the night. Overall good, just too many people during peak hours."
Nice place have a bathroom inside the park
"I have so much fun playing there as a kid, it's almost been 20 years.

So long in fact, I remember when the giant arrow had 4 segments instead of 3.

Still a great place for a nice walk."
"It's a wonderful park, fast and clean... it misses only the bathroom. üòÅ"
Really nice place to have fun in the snow with the family üòâ
"Honestly it's a Good place, and there is a spot for the kids"
"Beautiful and clean park. A nice place to play a soccer game, walk, ride a bike and enjoy the summer months"
Good place to have a good time
Very nice place all the year ( not in winter)
It's a great place to sliding on in the winter with the kids
"Awesome food, somewhat of waiting time with uber eats (1h30) due to restaurant."
Great place to slide down the hill
This park is really nice and active. It has everything you'd ever need in a park including a self weight workout area. It's perfect for kids or just people to chill around. The hill makes it a good place to have some bites/drinks on top while watching the sunset.
Fun for sledding with my children.
Funtastic
Great for winter activities!
"Great park, with a great view on the city on the litte hill. For winter days, you can glide on that hill it's really fun as it is quite high and just steep enough to get the thrill without the fear. Great for a family day out. And during summer there are 3 soccer fields where you can play, quite busy from 4 to 9 pm especially for soccer, and sometimes you can spend some time watching an official match which is a good thing too. If sports is not your thing you can always head to the bbq areas and do your thing there, just not the typical quiet place for bbq but for a city park it's nice. Overall a great place!!"
Such a cute parc and a hill with a great view of the city where u can watch the sunset üåÖ. Perf for a casual picnic with friends and family ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Amazing place to go winter sliding. We used aluminium saucers and had quite an adventure! I coated them with a new non-caloric silicon-based kitchen lubricant my company has been working on. It creates a surface 500 times more slippery than any cooking oil. Slid clear out of the park and ended up in a Walmart parking lot!
"Great spot for running üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Awesome place been enjoying this place since my youth. Lots of things to do and lots of people to see.
"Very open and friendly park in Villeray, Montr√©al"
Small park where you can do exercises outdoors. Not enough cans for garbage. A lot of dogs without leash. 7 soccer terrains (a lot of soccer games to watch). In winter you can bring your crazy carpet and have fun sliding down. Mostly kept clean.
Fun place to run
Cause they help me manager my money
Nice hill in the city
"Two playgrounds. Two soccer fields
Hill for sliding in the winter or rolling down (!)."
Nice place to spend time with kids and do some sport. This parc also offers a nice view on Montreal!
"The former municipalities of LaSalle and Lachine bequeathed Montrealers miles of beautiful shoreline parks along the St. Lawrence BUT we have Hydro-Qu√©bec to thank for this one, which is still in their possession. A long, narrow island extending parallel to the shore beside the Lachine rapids, it's a great place to ramble and to watch birds and people sporting about in the water."
"Great Park for walks, the view from the top of the Hill is amazing! You can see Mount Royal and even St. Joseph's Oratory!"
Beautiful view of the all-around.
"Born and raised in st michel, it's a beautiful park and brings back so many memories and I love how the Pompeii feast still happens!"
My type of neighborhood
"Small park for walking, gotta do the large circle completely at least 3 times to make it worth the walk (gives you about 45 min. walk you could go up the hill to make it a little harder!! Lots of soccer fields.
New Workout full body fitness routine stations on the east side of the hill.
Lots of dogs with no leash."
The place was amazing and I enjoied the place
Nice place...good for family bonding!!!
Loved it. Amazing mountain for sliding
A wonderful place to be with the whole family for picnic and to play soccer especially in the afternoon.
Nice fans
Good to walk. Soccer and a hill to climb
Peace is found anywhere but this my relaxing spot of anytime of the week
Great park for a walk with the dogs or a slide down the hill in winter
Highest winter slide hill in Montreal.
Good park great for a bike ride just no pool there it's pretty big and they only have football and soccer. And they put more playground areas for kids hope they do that
"Oh this park is the way to go when I wanna go spend sometime for myself, big has a lot of stuff for a park"
Good for jogging
Great Hill for sliding in winter. Big enough to be scary. Not the average baby Hill. More a teenager Hill.
Haven't been there in a while. Love what they did with the parc. Instantly became my favourite parc to train at
I love this park!!  Its got this big hill to slide on. It actually has a fence to seperate ppl climbing up from ppl going down.  Winter u can slide down and in summer ppl actually kite surf down :) its a perfect place to fly a kite. There is also a skating rink in winter.  Its not the best for modules in playground but kids do have fun. This park is mostly for the hill and open space!!!
Huge park to relax and enjoy out door activities for kids and adults as well .And very clean
Great place to go sledding in winter. The hill is big enough to initiate toddlers to skiing.
Nice place for flying a kite
Good for walks.  Hate the paid $$ parcking in winter. I mean come on it's empty!
I love this Parc. Big and tranquil.
"Huge space, clean , lot of playing devices for kids, 3 soccer fields, 1 football field and a high denivelation for sliding during the winter. Prepare to fight flies during the summer."
Love this place ‚ù§
Always good to see!
Fun
Amazingly fun in summer and winter
Well kept parc. Great for sporting activities.
"beautiful Park, gigantic ans spacious to run walk bike climb the hill train play soccer! clean park too!"
Nice park to visit.
My kids love this plsce
"Such a beautiful place to just wander around, and just relax. The huge Summit is very amusing in both winter and summer. I spent my best days of winter in this parc sliding from the summit till the end of the parc. And in summer you can even go with your bike and have an exciting ride from the summit to the earth, if you have the courage :))
Also the trees, the playing grounds, the huge empty space makes the parc perfect for little concerts and festivals like we had last summer. Can't wait!!!"
A  lot fun for free !!
Very nice park for sports activities and for had a fair playground for kids
"A beautiful place to go for a walk, to exersize, to watch or participate in sport events just enjoy your time in a company of squirrels."
"great park in winter i have been there many times as a child and always had a ton of fun
there is a big hill you can slide off with crazy carpets or tubes donuts really fun"
lot fo fun there. big parc  great summer and winter !
Kids have fun running! They were surprised that there's something else of their video games.
Excelente for different types of activities for kids. Enjoyed the party or Montr√©al 375th.

"It is a strolling park with pathway full of nature, it is like a relaxation therapy immersed in birds song, flower blossom and water flow. It happens to be the season of Japanese lilac. The distinctive fragrance of the white flowers are everywhere, so fresh.
The artificial lake and playground adds a family touch to the joy."
Very nice parc
Nice park for the family. Pond to watch the ducks and geese and a nice playground for the kids

Great little park for kids.
great park to relax in
Cool
Not bad

Fun park. Lots to explore and do for the little one.  A bit difficult go do without a second adult as the big kid play equipment is almost too easy to climb on for my little 18 month old.
Very clean portal potty on site well maintained. Sprinklers areoj
Local after school hangout. Could use a few more tables and benches.
Georgeous water views and a nice park. Heavily trafficked and well maintained
Cute park! I wish there were a few more baby swings and the water park had a bit more features but still lots of fun!
The litte bike path is just fabulous for the kids.
"Really cool, modern play structures, splash pad and a track for little bikes. Fun stuff for kids of all ages. Water fountain and porta-potty on site. Lots of street parking."
They renovated this park in 2017. It is a cool small neighborhood park for the kids. The water play is very small and showing its age. The design of having bigger kids biking and skating through the toddler's area is a flaw and a accident waiting to happen. Thankfully most parents that visit the park are responsible.
City provided toys. Great idea as long as the visitors take care of them.
Verdun's hidden gem
This park is really great. There is a swing for mommy to sit with baby. There is a handicap swing. There are apparatus for older and younger kids as well as a splash pad. Not enough you say? Well there is a mini bike/scooter trail and lots of grass to picnic or play on. Also there is shade and seating for parents. Truly one of the best parks in Verdun for kids under twelve.
Fun race track to 3wheel or scooter on and a bunch of shared toys that belong to the parküòÄ
Nice big park. Very clean. Loved it.
What's not to love?
Fantastic parc. Well gated. However i find that water area is too close to other games. Absolutely love the long chairs. Few more of those would have been nice!
Good play ground for younger children. Small old fashion water park and very long in park bike trail. Perfect for kids to learn and practice.
Top for fun ....kids and grownups
The houses were a lot better when I was younger
Nice little park in verdun
"Great park üòä my daughter loves it there. Think they need to update there sprinkler system tho,maybe add a few more swings üòÅ"
Amazing well done park.
This park was recently renovated. Good choose of attractions with resin on floor.
"Took my daughters here 2 years ago and it was a nightmare.  Broken beer bottles in the sand, one of the slides was vandalized to the point of being condemned. They renovated recently and now it's the playground of my dreams! Completely fenced in, tons of space, a bicycle path goes all around, chairs in the shade for the parents. Vast improvement!"
a very beautiful and special park
Loved it! Fenced in and safe for kids to play! Slides for different age groups!
Nice park. Lots of room for kids to run around. Has ok facilities.
Nicely done and well maintained
A regular park. Nothing to highlight.
The city really fixed this park up and made it more modern. Gone are the old metal slides of pain for modern plastic.
"Well maintained small parc , ideal for kids 2 to 7 years old"
Nice park was recently updated
Peaceful once the water & road construction ends
Recently renovated they did a very good job!!!

Love this big park. Me and my girl love to go for random walks.
Favorite park in town. Grew up nearby. The cave is nice.
"Nice park, easy to find parking. Good facilities."
Love this park
"Great park to go with the family. The pool is pretty big, it has a splash pad section for little ones and it is pretty clean for a public pool. The park has fun games for the kids and a basketball court."
"Nice little park, lots of nature in the city!"
"Nice place to have fun and enjoy with family
Baseball field
Soccer field
Swimming pool"
"It's huge, full of nice families, a lot of places to do picnics, play soccer  basketball or baseball plus it's have a cave."
Modules for children are boring but great place for swimming and sports.
Good park with a medium parking
"I'd give it a 3,5 out of 5. The reason why is that it's a beautiful park with lots of coloured trees you can climb on. You can also organize picnics and other outdoor activities. But, it's too small and open to the street. Still a pretty decent park though."
Good
Nice place for walking
Nice baseball field
"During the summer, they don't turn on the ballpark lights unless there is a scheduled game. Many nights we need to stop a practice because of darkness by 8:30pm"
Shockingly gorgeous park with lovely trees and a diverse selection of things to do.
"I love this park. There is a pool, 2 baseball fields and a soccer field."
Calm and peaceful place to play sports
Good place to walk.
It's a nice park
"Sick spot for Pok√©mon go, two double lures in the park. Best in st Leonard"

You cannot bring your dog in any part in St-Leonard. It really sucks.
"Can't bring your dog on a leash.
But its OK to bring your cats, rats & snakes
Park sucks.
Full of drunks"

"great experience. One shotted a few orphans. 13 kills. defaulted on some noobs. They have filed a restraining order against me, not aloud within 50 feet of the building."
had a victory royale there in season 5 before tryhards came and wiped it off the next game. its fine. tho gg bro
It is an alley at best but in a residential area. Should not have its own listing on Maps.
better comming  back
Very cool and gangsta
fortnite hahahah lol!
"Very nice place, calm and no more smoking on the terasse !!"
"Great terrasse, especially since there is no smoking now!"
Go with kids to play
Amazing
Nice
"This is one of our favorite parks. Small but intimate, cozy nice play areas for kids. There are in ground trampolines. And everyone who come there is just in a good mood. Very nicely kept and cool.to see the community gardens too in there."
"Newly renovated park for kids of all ages! They have a cool water splash area, a separate play area for younger/older kids. There's even 3 trampolines incorporated into the older kids area... I'll admit that I've been on the trampoline a few times already, it's great exercise (and I am not a kid anymore!)."
Beautiful place
excellant
Nice and calm do recommend
Belle place

"I love that this park is shady, relatively clean and has a fun splash pad for toddler age +. If you look closely you may see a friendly groundhog just strutting byüòÖ"
Beautiful park. Excited to see the new real estate agency opening next door. Qube Realty. They sell properties for only 0.5% commission with a broker at record speeds using crazy online technologies combined with centris. They been blowing up. Have friends that used them.
Nice
Nice and quiet park with lot of space for kids to run.
Nice little neighborhood park
"There is a fun-filled splash pad, enjoyed by locals and visiting day camps. Enjoyment for young and old alike üö≤üõ¥üéæüé∂üåû ."
Best dog park around!
"Great dog park with a water pump, lots of shady areas , and a seperate fenced area for small dogs. Was very clean and would go back again when in the neighbourhood."
Perfect fun at walking distance
"Very cozzy park
Sprinkles for young children's also organize Football (soccer) field and at the end of the park a dog friendly area. THE ONLY PROBLEM IN THE JUNGLE AREA IS THE BROKEN BLEU SLIDE FOR THE KIDS.  A Full summer all gone Shame please get it fix. FINALLY FIX in SEPTEMBER 2018 thank you"
Park in winter was covered in snow. What you expect when a park is covered in snow.
Great splash pad & baby swings.
Nice park for kids
Not g
Best dog park in the area!
Nice parc for soccer
Beau terrain peux √™tre mieux
"Walking and watching the boats, the river, the other islands. Sitting in the breeze, it is a Romantic place to be.
Many public installations benches, swings, but also several events are organized all year around. Bring a book and read. Or just come to watch the port on the right side: Huge Tankers and the largest Cruise Ships pass in front of you."
"Been walking here with my kids for the last 5 years. Always a great spot to relax. Summer and winter.  It's next to the water, you can appreciate boats passing by. ‚õµ"
"The best place to spend time in Pointe-Aux-Trembles, fun events and great view of the St-Laurence"
"Quiet park on the St. Lawrence River, good place for fishing, launche a kayak or canoe, huge centennial trees"
"Met my girlfriend there, I love the view and its pretty calm over there"
Not complete it still needs work
Loved it!!!
Love the place
Pretty
Small but nicely located
Fresh fruit and vegetables
Very nice place
"Except for the rain, it was awesome!!"
"Busy skating rinks, people happy to enjoy outdoors, kids learning to skate or slide on small hills, grownups loving spending time with family"
Could use a face lift and maybe a dog run.  But it's still somewhere for kids to play. Also has a good shinny rink in the winter
"It's a good park, plenty of space to do activities"
Dog park is an additional bonus to this place. It has a children's park too. Great place to have a small picnic üôÇ
During the winter months good for ice skating
Nice and quiet park
Great little pocket park. Everything a full park has in the space of a block. Two play areas with equipment: one for children over five and a other fenced off area for 3 to 5 year olds. A chalet with toilets and team rooms. A decent size playing field. A few park benches.
Very nice quiet patk
I go there pretty much every day with my 2 daughters. The small children park with is enclosed so you can let them play in the sand and relax on the benches. There is also a bigger kids area. The water fountain works fine and the are public bathrooms. It's also a space often used for community initiatives.
Beautiful üòç
Nice park but the playground for older kids is in bad condition
great little park that's enclosed.
A quiet park across from some large apartment buildings. Not incredibly clean but the jungle-gym and swings are well kept.
"Charming little park well suited for young children and family activities. Softball field and children's playground, skating rink"
Fan favourite for the kids.
It's small but everyone likes it
Nice park
Community family park. Friendly chill vibe.
Super!
"First met my future wife there in 1970, so it's a bit of our history.
It was called Terrebonne Park then."
Peacefull
Nature at its finest
Quite
Good
Love it
Great place
It's a nice shady park.
Great park.
"Nice, quiet park."
Nice and quiet
Small nice and cozy
This is a nice little park that is easy to miss if you are passing on Ontario street (near the frontenac metro) because it is behind some buildings. It's a good place to have a seat and relax. There is also tenis courts and play area for kids.
Small but lots of activities for kids even my 15 years enjoyed a ton
"I love this place but that could be because of my long history with it, but it is a great place. There aren't many people there so you can go get some peace and tranqility is you ever visit the place.however I must admit that even though it is a calming area it is suretenely not a fun one there isn't much to do all you'll find is a park for children and a tennis court"
Well when I was there it was clean and quiet also peaceful in there.
"Nice park we went to play Tennis but when we got there it was about 9:50 then at 10 all the light went black and it was closed, they should really have the times online we were just visiting and thought we'd go for some late night tennis. I guess not. Nut the park seemed nice it was clean and lots of garbage can for people to throw stuff away."
I liked it.
"Nice and quiet long park. It stretches from Ontario up to Hochelaga and has numerous sections (Kids park, tennis, walkway, etc.) Rouen street is currently closed (summer 2019) as part of a project to unite both stretches of the park."
We rally enjoy it !!üòä
Summer concerts every Tuesday evening during the summer. Absolutely lovely placr
Nice park with great tree cover. Great place to hangout on a summer day.
Well organized park.
I went there one time in summer for Polish festival. Place was nice and shady with lots of trees. Good spot to bring your kids to play around...
Amazing
"Clean, pretty little park. My group and I sat and played Pokemon GO here for a while."
Nice quiet park. Good place to have lunch putside when at work.
Quite place to relax
"Interesting,  nothing special, good as neighbor hood parc, bring your water cause it doesn't taste good in the fountain"
Very nice park.
Nice
"I was on stage performing"" Gipsy"",loved it."
"Very quiet and relaxing park, complete with tennis courts, communal gardens and a playground / pool for the kids. There's also the occasional Food truck sighting which is always great."
"One of the parks I go to the most. I'm a big fan of its outdoor gym, and there's a lot of green space for other exercises as well."
Nice place
"Beautiful park, a lot of flowers and trees, tables and chairs"
Love it lots for anyone
Good parc  but a little bit dirty
Nice place the view is amazing.

Quiet park to relax and read at.
Nice park but a lot of dust
"Not the best park in town, but you got all of the amenities and even a small trekFit park!"
Lovely park for a picnic and close to the metro.
üåûüíï

Very nice parc open areas and small pool for kids

Small place with benches to rest.
"Such a quiet place for spending time with yourself and friends...
you will feel refreshed. It‚Äôs a good idea to bring some food."
Nice path for bike and walk. Unfortunately not many view spots and middle section closed. At evening time mosquitos can be a problem. Everything else is nice. There are bio-toilets at each official parking spots.
"Such a beautiful place, it is well maintained the trails are easy to walk yet amazingly pretty. The welcome center is closed due to covid but there is a toilet available if needed.

Highly recommended for bird watching, we saw many woodpeckers and some owls!

The parking is 7,50 for 2h or 9,50$ for the day but the use of the park is free"
"Good dessert spot

Try out the lotus or that Nutella

You can't go wrong"
"Nice to make a bbq besides a lake. The beach is small, so get early if you want a good spot"
"Really nice by the water on the northern side of the island. The walkway has been under re-construction for a couple years now, which makes it difficult to walk decent distance from there though."
"Beautiful view of the sunset in the evening. Nice walking trails, but the trails get muddy during rain. Parking is 7.50 for two hours and 9.50 Cad for complete day. Pretty quite and small park."
"It is a beautiful and serene area,  not overpopulated. Great to breath the fresh air cleansed by the trees, restful and peaceful. Fantastic place for birdwatchers to take stunning photographs. To take a bike ride or a simple walk feels rewarding to the soul. The waterside of the park is remarkable. I adore the sounds of the river running its course. Its healthy to be in nature. Worthy of a visit."
Very spacious park with lots of trails. Sightseeing during the winter: the downy woodpecker! There were many little buddies during my walk. Sadly couldn‚Äôt get a close enough picture.
"Great trails for biking ,hiking etc love it here"
"Beautiful park year round lovely trails through the woods. Please note that the pictured long wooden boardwalk through one marsh has been dismantled. There is a new one however that gives great views of the wildlife. If you come by bike, enter the park by the de l'Eglise entrance and it's an amazing downhill coast down to the marsh!"
"Very nice place to walk and/or ride your bicycle... However, it's a pity that a family place is used for people to smoke weed freely without caring if there are children, or simply other people who are not supposed to to ""enjoy your taste""."
"Came here thinking we'd see the beautiful pathways from the photos, but I believe that it no longer exists. Besides that, this park is well maintained, beautiful walking trails in winter, not slushy, veryyy big and people are super nice and welcoming here. A big PLUS is that this park is not super crowded. Recommend this park to families to come for a good walk in nature. Underrated park ! Would come back for sure"
Very nice and peaceful park. High recommended to take in the peaceful nature that surrounds Montreal.
We wnt biking with our kids.  Easy and fun beginner trail!
It's nice for easy trekking and walk...they have 7 km long trek.  The island is nice.
"A great spot to take a hike and ""leave"" the city behind you, while still in the city."
First time being here and I‚Äôm very thankful to have stepped in to this place. It‚Äôs a hidden forgotten place. I heard it has been renovated that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs looking very pretty. The trail is long and a bit confusing so it‚Äôs better to bike it than to walk it. You won‚Äôt regret this magical place. It‚Äôs one of the best spot to paddle boat and catch the sunset!
"Great place to spend a day walking or cycling in the fresh air, among the woods, a lol Ong well kept pathways"
"Disappointing. Unfortunately, the beautiful boardwalk pictured no longer exists. It had begun to buckle years ago, as has another boardwalk in the park. As a result, access to some of the best areas of the park is no longer possible. The park is cut in two.

As someone who loved this park, it is a shame. The main boardwalk has not been replaced, and the large, expansive marsh it crossed is no longer accessible. We have been hoping it would have been replaced long ago."
"I enjoyed the rabbit trial , very beautiful scenery and pleasant 11 km, sunset on the waterfront was fantastic, area for picnics and free parking"
Very pleasant and relaxing environment. The parking is not available.
One of the best hiking places near Montreal
Good park for dogs. Has poo bags and water
Perfect trails for cycling and hiking. Plenty of benches to enjoy a meal or two on. Several lookouts where if you're quiet and patient enough you can see some cool wildlife. Love this park!
There is no a wide space to chill out. All the tables are close to each other. Not recommended to spend your weekend there.
"Great hiking, you can protected by the shades of the trees"
"Quite, good for waking meditation, I enjoyed  it."
"Some traits and still closed but other than that, it is beautiful place"
This is a splendid park with well-groomed walking trails.
Beautiful swamps all over the park. Tracks well made for winter. Just an amazingly underated park.
"Synonymous to Ile-Bizard, the nature parks offer forested pathways to both residents and visitors. The unfortunate part is its popularity which makes it a bustling place where tranquility is becoming more difficult to come across."
Too much construction on the site. Trails closed for 'maintenance' (how do you maintain a trail??? only in Montreal... ) the parking at the north end of the island is open but the trail leading out towards the hiking area is closed... ridiculous. Will not return for a while despite growing up in this area.
"Were weak ago..too much mud,   ok for walking , trails weren't possible for bicycles."
Fun riding in the trails ...didn't see anyone else there..Great day
"Great park and woods. Either for hiking or biking, it is really a piece of heaven in city. Lakes' view is amazing. You can find one of the hidden observatories and meditate peacefully. Gorgeous lake view, nature sounds, sun or shadow just remedy for depression or any stress of life. In last two years they were working on restoring the old wooden long bridges. Hope they finish these soon. This was a loss lately. You can take amazing photos for both fauna and flora. If this review was helpful please don't forget to like it. Thank you and enjoy your experience!"
Very busy but amazing view by the water and plenty to do
Neat park yet very muddy if you go the day after a rain or when snow is melting.
I simply love this park!
Park is nice but the trails are not very well marked or maintained. Not too stroller friendly in several places.
"Paid parking is open but the hike is almost completely closed, so we paid $9.5 for nothing."
"Lovely , relaxing place , love the river"
"Beautiful park! huge trees and ponds ..the park is very large and is fun to walk or bike in the summer. When the renovation/construction of the ""passerelles"" (foot bridges) will be done..it will be perfect!"
"If you love nature, its a great place to visit. My family loved it"
Nlce place since the other beach was packed.  So we went to this beach. It was nice then it started to fill up and people didn't respect the social distancing.  So we had to leave since we had 2 small children with us. What a bummer.
Lovely wide paths and well maintained
Beautiful park
"Awesome views ! No shops nearby
Small island with great colours (Autumn caption)"
Unfortunately 2 areas of the Park are currently closed because of the flood. There is still access to a good walk in the woods from de l'eglise road. Parking $7.00 for 2 hours. $9.00  for day.
"Love the area. A great place to bike, hike, or walk. Would recommend going back again for another hike. Just make sure to use the hikijg trails off the beaten paths."
Nice place for a quick family hike.   Dogs allowed on leash.
"Good place to walk, with a small beach also lots of places for picnic"
"Lots of place to picnic, biking, walking.  Beach and  natural landscapes. Good place also to watch animals take pictures and relax."
Very nice play for cc skiing.
"nice place to picnic. lots of table and such. But if you are going for the beach part you will likely be disappointed as it's super tiny and water not appealing (rocks, algae, very cloudy water)"
nice park
Much of the park is under construction and closed to the public. (summer 2020). It'll be much nicer once things reopen
quite small area of ‚Äúbeach‚Äù but accessible to go not faraway. No entry fee but 7$ -2hours and 9$ for a day
"Needs help, used to be a great park, rundown"
Great excersise
Wonderful place to explore. Loved it!
"A place for the light hiking. You also can go to swim, because there's a small beach."
Amazing 10/10
"The worst park I've ever been near Montreal. Trails in deap mud, park lacks care, but... you'll have to pay for parking."
Beautiful park and have nice views.
Very beautiful Forest..the fall colors are really enchanting.
Not too many people and nice to be in nature
"Visited here to snowshoe last Sunday, and never knew we had yet another beautiful park in the west island. Definitely recommend for hiking, snowshoeing etc..."
Worth exploring„ÄÇ
"Beautiful nature, I was doing UPS delivery."
Went there and there was no one (Sunday).  The trails are nice and there's a pavilion. Rode around on my bike.....
"Nice, but paying for parking in winter feels unnecessary."
"Main attraction, the boardwalk or Grande Passerelle, doesn't exist anymore, also meaning that the principal circuit or loop end in a cul-de-sac. Deception for the kids. The beach is also closed. Overall, you can walk but don't expect any special ¬´view"". People have to write ¬´You are here"" themselves on the maps so it's understandable. This Park is not maintain or what it used to be. For around 10$ for parking, kind of a deception in 2020."
Fabulous place to enjoy nature without having to drive hours to get to!
"Beautiful park to walk or bike around, great trails and better views!"
"Beautiful place to spend with family, watch birds, walk the trails"
This park is beautiful. There is a nice long boardwalk on the water that is a must see. Nice for a bike ride too. It also has recently gone through construction so it definitely is a lot nicer than what it used to be before. Great area to visit on a summer day.
"It's a small Beautiful place, not a lot of people and perfect for a quick summer beach sesh! The info center was closed because of covid when we reached there and it sucked that there was no access to washrooms because of that!"
Wonderful! Great walking trails. You can also snowshoe and do cross-country skiing. Can't wait until they finish the construction of the new bridges.
Calm and peaceful place to relax and walk or jog
"Nice park, charcoals, tables and lots of parking. Small private beach, good times."
"Beautiful place to walk in family, but there are a lot of bikes....."
"Do Yourself a favor and DON'T go there during the summer season 2019!!!
The place is infested with flies !!! I got tons of Very bad bites!! Had to run to Dr and am taking cortisone pills and applying cortisone cream! It's a very pretty place. Maybe this infestation id caused by the flooding earlier this season? Sand bags still there in rabbit trail. Another thing, go in groups bec You can Get lost! Put a marking along Your path to know how to get out of the park. Don go this season if You don't want to end up at a Dr emergency."
Refreshing walks during all seasons with cross country and snowshoeing trails in the winter. Beautiful place to visit close to Montreal but away from the hustle and bustle.
It was okay - a bit rocky and not as popular but it was kinda nice not being being too busy. Lifeguards didn't really enforce the 6ft rule but otherwise good
Parts of the path currently inaccessible due to work being done. Otherwise a nice park.
This used to be my favorite nature walk period but after 2 years of construction we still haven't finished and the park is partly closed. I expect it will take at least 5 years for Nature to repair all the damage and return to the original beauty. So sad.
Very nice for adventures people also has a golf course nearby
Beautiful park
Very nice view and nice trails to walk
Big nice park to walk and do some bike trails
Nice park. Big beautiful trees. Feels like the Jungle but without the wild animals. Highly recommended.
Nice place to walk around. Good for all abilities since they're not real hiking trails. You can even bring a baby carriage.
"I would've given zero stars if I could. When we were back from our 1 hour walk to the parking lot, we saw that somebody shattered the rear window and robbed our car. This is the Mont√© de l'√©glise entrance. There is no security camera, no guard, no booth, whatsoever. I wonder why they charge the 7-9$ parking fee, when there is no security there. If I wanted my car to be robbed, I would have parked it somewhere else for free... This parking lot is clearly the SPOT for this particular thief and seems to be doing it often, as this entrance is practically in the middle of nowhere and the closest bodyshop said that they have one case like this every week. AVOID going there and if you do go there, empty your car first. The place is not safe at all."
"Nature is great, if you see litter, pick it up. Keep our parts clean. If you throw junk out in a park rather than wainting 10 minutes to find a garbage. Rethink your life."
"Really nice park, but the paths should be widened"
"Great place to come and enjoy the views, also nice for biking!"
Great beach and nature spot
"Nice park, lots of walking in a shaded forest to be done"
Nice parc for hiking and biking.
Great place very calm and sooo beautiful.
Nice job on the new bridge but it's taking to long to finish the other one.
"Overall great, but have to pay for parking. Fun in winter and summer. Small beach there, very shallow water. Nice when it's hot. Wooden bridge is closed due to spring flood of 2017. What a shame. Will probably take ages to re-build. Great biking area in the summer too."
Boardwalk still not rebuilt. Sad!
Signs are down on most trails this winter
"nice quiet parc, with lots of biking trails"
Gorgeous!
"Beautiful nature, I like it so much."
"0 stars. Visited for the first time a week ago. Did not go off trail, respected those trails that were temporarily closed --- came out with poison ivy. Also the trails that are closed seem to be the nicest/most popular. Didn't get to experience them, and for the same price + poison ivy! Wont be going back. Can't trust the signs, can't trust that it's well maintained, and by reading the comments - can't trust that your car wont get broken into. 0 security, no cameras. Don't risk it!"
All under renovation... Renovation seems to have no apparent end date as it's been half closed for almost three years now... All the good parts are off limits.
"One of my favourite parks of all time. Many winding trials throughtout this expansive park. Lots of trees and wildlife. The main attraction in my opinion has to be the swamp area where there is an amazing boardwalk to walk/bike on. Unfortunately, construction had removed the boardwalk as it was aging and has yet to be replaced."
üôèüèº‚úåÔ∏èüåàlove it
A wooded gem. This park has forest in it's natural state with well maintained trails. There is a boardwalk over a large marsh where birdwatching can net a number of species. I like looking for the turtles too. Owl will nest in the forest. Walking in the summer is great. In the winter the trails are very popular with cross-country skiers. The northern section of the park has a chalet and a very small beach. The beach fronts a swimming area that is very shallow and perfect for very young children. A lifeguard is on station in the summer for daytime hours. We need more parks like this one in the Montreal area.
Beautiful Nature Park and marsh!
"Nice to bike ride, great view"
Relaxing place
It friendly and has a beautiful nature
"Great Park, Close to Montreal, Close to the City.
Reasons to go:
1. The Variety of Birds, Turtles and Wildlife
2. Nice Swamps, Nice Ponds

Yet the park can take you less than 2:30 hours to do almost all the routes, also parts of the park are close to the main road, and you can hear cars a lot. Also parts of the park are not well maintained, the bridges where down and dangerous when I went there.

But all in all worth a one time visit, I did it walking, yet biking seems to also be a fun option."
A stunningly beautiful park. Walking over that marsh on the wooden path at night with stars above is one of the most magical moments of my life.
"The park is retaining natural flavour. The river along is great add on to beauty of place. Ofcourse on board walk is closed for maintenance.
It's really worth visit for tourists as well locals in neighbouring towns."
Beautiful nice place to rest by the water
Good one ‚ò∫
No playground for kids
"The big part of the park is closed/under construction, so going there now is a waste of time. Disappointed."
"Expensive parking 9.5$ for a day, limited water view seats"
"Excellent place to bike, cross country ski, watch birds, turtles, or just take a walk with your dog. If you want quietness, this is the place. The parking is paid, around $7 for 2 hours or $9 for the day. But there are other entrances, you may find your way around and park for free.
Cross country skis are available for rent in the main entrance."
Stunning place to walk
Nice place to visit and walk with friends or dogs.
"A nice place t√¥t ale a walk, breath in the fresh cool air and enjoy the woods"
Well marked trails but still a bit confusing. Would have been nice if it had a view of the lake.
"Beautiful parc, too bad it is not maintained properly."
I love running in the park. Great for family walk in any season.
Good trails but they took out most of the big long passerelle over the water.  That was half the beauty of these trails.  Now the trails are short and don't all connect.
It's a beautiful Nature park with miles of various walking trails.
beautiful sunsets!
it was nice all tho a bit disturbed by the noise of cars depending on where you are
"Great place to relax, almost forgot I was in Montreal..."
Good hiking experience. It's a very easy trail but made thr most of it.
Best birding spot in Montreal. Great for marsh birds such as least bitterns. Currently (2017) the boardwalk is closed. Park is free but parking is $5.
Another typical poorly run poorly managed public facility run by city of Montreal. Almost as bad as their laughably poor website. Maybe contracts shouldn‚Äôt be given to politicians friends and relatives. Unbelievably low standard all round....perhaps an increase in taxes would be the answer.
"The trail was good for biking, only negative was the swamp area that is the direct route to the beach has been closed for renovations for over a year."
"Beautiful, well groomed trails for walking, skiing, snowshoeing, biking in a quiet forest setting accessible from multiple entrances.  Lots of birds and wildlife.  Saw a brown barn owl out during the afternoon today while snowshoeing with the kids!"
Nice and quiet place
"I wish I discovered this place earlier üòÅ
Beautiful, but beware of the poisonous plants. Lots of them are there."
"Beautiful park. Lots of different landscapes. Two access points to water, which is nice since the rest of the island's shoreline is privately owned."
What used to be a great park with 2 boardwalks which allowed one to observe wildlife has been decimated to a few trails through the woods without access to water since the construction of the new boardwalks is stalled.
This is a beautiful park for a stroll or a bike ride. The paths are clean and well maintained. You'll find plenty of wildlife to observe.
Nice Area for a pinic
This is  a place to get away and just walk and think... or not.. go to the far side and sit on the rocks looking out at the water
"Some parts are still closed for renovation, but you still pay when you park. A lot of giant Mosquitos"
Endless walking and the lakes on the map are not really lakes on the ground.
The entrance to the main trail opposite the parking lot is blocked/ flooded by water. I wish the City could have posted a sign BEFORE I paid $7 for parking. Really poor mgtd.
Very nice park 30 min from Montr√©al.  Note: the long overpass is close for the season.
Better prepare for mosquitos on hot/ humid days
"Very large park with forest, great for long walks or bike trips. Features a larger lake in the middle, where, if lucky, you may spot beavers. Also, White-tailed deers may cross the gravel paths within the park. Unfortunately, impossible to get here by public transportation."
"Nice pasarelle with some wild animals. You can see turtles, fishes, frogs. Nice hiking. Nit too many places for picnic."
"Good place to launch your boat or kayak, free! Close to a nice fishing spot too."
"I won't  go again until they do not repair the bridges which are broken already for a couple of year and still in construction.
Be aware of mosquitos if you want to stroll in the woods!"
Great park on √éle Bizard. Really nice place to go on a bike ride or just on a stroll. Big wide gravel paths allow for easy travels.
Great place in the west island to go for a walk and get some fresh air! So close to the hustle and bustle of the city yet a tranquil oasis at the same time!
Most of the trails are closed or inaccessible currently.
"Very nice park! Good for kayaking, hiking and other outdoor activities!"
I love the place. But this year maybe because of the flood the bridge was missing and the experiance was not complete. But stll very beautiful place.
Wonderful place.
Came for a Guepe demonstration on frogs.  The kids loved it and I saw enough of it to want to come back to explore the rest of the park.
Relaxing green oasis in the city. Beautiful park go biking or walking lots of wildlife to see.
One of my favorite nature Parks. Great place to go for a bikeride
"Can't wait for the construction to be finished, then I'll revise my review to 5 stars."
A very good place for a walk or a bike ride they have many trails from short to long
"Great place to walk, run, bike, whatever!  Nature in the middle of town."
Beautiful place to explore

Peaceful and beautiful nature.
Fun little walk with the wife. Would recommend it to anyone of all ages!
Very nice spot. Nature park. Enough parking.
"Beautiful park, great for running, biking or simply walking to enjoy nature within Montreal vicinity"

Good for family
"Great place for a stroll and a bike ride.

Be careful with poison Ivy and mosquitoes."

"Tr√®s beau parc. Il manque un peu de table alors pensez √† vous prendre une couverture si vous deviez manger sur le doux sable de la plage.

Mon seul d√©sagr√©ment, la violente odeur de canabis qui nous √©tait... in√©vitable"
"It is an artificial lake in the middle of residential area.
As someone visiting, it feels wonderful in seeing resident building by one side, and water at the other. It must be a money costing project. To please the eyes , it is successful. To create an environment that will attract living creatures, it is doing well. I saw Canada goose, duck and fish. I am very sure that there should be frogs hiding somewhere to help cleaning up the mosquito too.
This is early spring. Water is clear and air is fresh. Wind is blowing. Flowers will soon come. Also, there are people jogging along the lake and children passing by with parents.
The fungshui is good for this season.
Will come back when the season changes."
quiet sport activities and great view of sunset.
Nice and calm place for a cup of coffee at the morning.
It is a nice place to walk around
Nice place to hang out and take a walk. Mosquitos in the summer
I love it. Nice place to relax
Picturesque pond with nice surroundings great for a relaxing evening walk.
"Beautiful, restful park when I stopped to enjoy the view...ducks on the pond, a cool breeze, the sounds of children playing (there is a daycare just across the street) and the sunlight playing thru the trees! If I'd been a painter or poet...ah, it was the perfect day for that!"
Beautiful place.
"PROS: beautifully designed area  |  relaxing environment  |  perfect for kids & sport lovers
CONS: none"
Great place for walks with my baby.
Mesmerizing place!! Great for a walk
"A cute and calm park in the middle of a cute neighbourhood. Lots of animals can be spotted like ducks, koi fish and turtles."
"Wonderful views, serene environment."
One of the nicest place to take picture or walk in Montreal
"I love it it's calm and adorable with all these birds and fishes, the nature speaks"
It's quite you can watch forever
Love to walk around this park at sunrise...
Went there twice as a photographer wedding assignement. Truly amazing place. Beautiful. Would go there during my spare time for a walk without hesitation.
IT is beautiful and peaceful
Great place to walk about... but very noisy.... right in the path of runway.... jets flying overhead every five minutes !
A nice place to walke and relaxe

Beautiful artificial lake with goldfish
Great for a relaxing family spot
"I came across it on an impromptu walk while waiting for an appointment, I was pleasantly surprised. Part of a larger park, it seems to be popular for wedding photos, so that tells you something."
Cool
"It a nice new park located in a pretty hidden spot.
It's got nice structures for children to play on as well as a spot sheltered from the rain or sun with tables and benches to sit at for the parents.
One of the two tables is also accessible to those in wheelchairs as one of the four benches is missing!
The park has a communal garden if you wish to participate (make sure to sign up first).
The whole park sits on a hill which gives a view that goes quite far; too bad the only things to see are condo buildings, factories, or construction sites."
Great place
Calm and collected
"Nicely located off metropolitain highway (Aut 40), it‚Äôs easy to stop here if you‚Äôre driving across Montr√©al. A lot of investment has been put in this park. Adult exercise station, more challenging playground for older kids up to 12 and little kid section."
"My kid loves this park... Always clean, great splash pad! Wish the bathrooms were open, but that's a city issue."
Excelent for kids since it's renovation! Amazing little water games.
A little run down and in need of some TLC. Not bad if you just want to go for a walk and have a small place for the kids to play.
Lovely parc
Good park
"This is a very small spot, nice anyway."
"This is not a park, is where homeless people gather in dark shadowed  threes outside Tim hortons, a must avoid place"
"This Statue of Dr. Norman Bethune is located in downtown Montreal, near Concordia University and Metro Guy."
Not alot of swings for bigger kids  only baby swings other than that not bad
Excellent little park with plenty of shade.
I.
Nice place
Dope park.  I went there to play basketball.  Was a little disappointed when I saw there is only one hoop but will definitely go back.
Lot of soccer fields. Good location with easy access but parking can be very challenging. Good place for kids. Very spacious with lot of playing devices and water jets for summer time. There is a little denivelation but I don't think It is intended for sliding during the winter  season. Recommended.
"Great, very organized and nice staff"
Love this place they have a beautiful park for my baby and also for my dog!
Good place for kids to play and have fun with their parents around
"Was an exciting and exhilarating experience being at the park  with various kiddies fun games available.
My daughter was super excited and I was happy to see that there were various gymnastics available for all ages and places for parents to sit and have a close watch of their wards"
"Parc St Benoit is not a dog park, it's a nice size children playground, athletic and football filed as well as a dog parc"
It was nice and clean too
Nice
"The parc has a splash zone, a soccer field and a playground"
"For now, the police warned that we should keep the children away from the playing area."
Walk my dog there quite often. So far so good. Clean too
Clean dog park  the area however seems rather on the poor & dirty side. Lots of garbage & glass on the street leading to the dog park which is bad for dogs.
It too many people
Clean and fun
nice
:p
Nice place to visit! All this green is good for health! But feels like some trees could fell! Otherwise very cool!
"Love this little piece of nature, it's not very big but walking peacefully between trees is always a good thing."
Make you feel the natrue is just  at next door.
"It's a beautiful Park in the middle of Montreal, once there you forget the city things, it's like being in the wild."
Full of nature's beautiful surprises! üíö
"Very nice place to run, full of pure oxygen for your tired lungs, good for kids too."
Peaceful. Great view for photos
"Beautiful, but can be dangerous after dark"
Great forest! Cool to go for a walk or bike around. Ghere should be a little more security in it sometimes.
"Big park. Has a large wooden area covering almost 3 street corners. With few different ""treks"". Has outdoor swings and slides and playing ground for kids. Has few areas with picnic tables."
"Calm and nature like, I feel in the jungle"
A nice experience of a forest with accessibile tracks
Great wooded park in the east end of the city. A niece tree lined path on the inside. The main path is also lit at night. Great for a walk !
Nice park.  Nice forest and good child play areas

It's a Park
great
"Nice field. There should be more trash bins around however. The bleachers had a bunch of garbage around them (food containers and the like)

5 stars if means of keeping the park clean were more accessible."
There is two soccer field a playground and a skate park great place
"I didn't actually get through the park, I went behind the school figuring I would get out on Central but there were locked gates üò† so I had to walk back, fortunately I found an open fence and  was able to get out to Bishop Power.üòÇü§£Got in my steps though despite pain all the way."
"It's not quite the park it used to be. However it's still serviceable so to speak. The playground is decent, when not vandalized by the nearby high school. Which honestly, happens far less then you might expect, the soccer field is small, but features a modern social turf surface, and is generally accessible to the public. The pool in general is not overwhelmingly busy in the summer, which is a definite bonus."
Big sports field
"Great place, highly recommend for workouts or running"
"Nice park, 2 soccer field, public pool and skate park .
The skate park dont have enought light at night time."
Great field for activities and a cool LED light
"In this park, there are different installations for sports. Like, baseball American football etc. You can find buses that can take you there if you don't want to drive. If you live near, this is a good place to bring your kids. The park is also near the river in case you want to go and admire the neighborhood."
"The skatepark is filled with people who are not useing any skateboards, bikes or blades. They are in the way of those who come to use it. One parent yelled at me for hitting a child when i fell off my board accidentally and blames me but i think she should not allow a child of 5 years old to be running around a skatepark."
Nice park
Nice soccer field
great park swimming pool and soccer field only issue is that the lights close early
Great place for activity football (soccer) light stay on until 9-930pm. Plus a pool near by.
Larger than the other fields. Lights are always lit. Looks so good and gives a nice light.
Nice park with alot of fields and courts
Showers are not working. There is not privicy to change your clothes.
"Multipurpose park. Playground area, outdoor pool, skate park, grass and turf soccer fields. Outdoor skating rink in the winter."
Perfect place for boys to play and bike arround
Is nice and clean
"A nice place to walk, exercise, and bike ride."
Good for kids.

"So beautiful,,lots to look at and a very good time"
Beautiful parc well maintained family friendly
"This is where we laid out our blankets and ate our picnic, because of the shade trees, and the real attraction is across the street: the actual water front.  Therefore this park is very quiet and less frequented than the waterfront park."
Great for a piknic
"Small space, great view of the st Laurence river."

"Lovely Park, Very Clean, And A Great Place To Relax."
Decent park to chill and relax at. Great for kids also.
Nice park for kids and picnics.  Free kids pool in the summer and free outdoor skating in the winter with a small heated chalet to put your skates on in. Large green space with trees too. Never too busy.
Fun park for the family. Great for relaxation and leisure time.
"Beautiful parc with old trees, nice little pool and several playgrounds. Really cool in the unbearable summer heat."
The trees are really good at being trees and you can barely heard the 40 highway over the scream of old people mad at you for playing p√©tanque on their bocc√© field. Very relaxing.
"Our local park, nice and quiet with a skating rink in the winter."
Very nice place for family and children
"Very nice park!  Bathrooms, green space, kiddie pool and a toddler playground."

Also for some morning jogging."

"Tr√®s beau parc dans un beau quartier. Beaux √©quipements et jeux pour enfants. Le b√©mol est l'absence de toilettes ouvertes. Un Dj √©tait l√† un vendredi soir pour animer le parc, c'est tr√®s sympa!"
"De grandes pelouses arbor√©es, de belles airs de jeux... malheureusement, la pataugeoire √©tait ferm√©e... Mais beau parc, nous y retournerons."
Beautiful playground for kids for splash pad and games for toddlers and bigger kids.
I especially like the water games.
"Excellent from baby to teens. Good equipment and waterworks(summer only). Super basketball court for the big kids (up to 50 yrs.) Super park also across the street. Treed , benches, picnic tables and dancing at night. Pick up a picnic supper at Crown Diner and enjoy."
Great splash pad. Basketball and swings. Picnic tables too
A really pleasant playground with splash pad. A friendly place.
"Nice little park with basketball, splash pad, and little jungle gym. Pub and icecream nearby."
"It's a fun water park, but the ground is really slippery.  I've seen many kids falling down and it can be dangerous."
"This is a great place in the summer. Picnic tables, water park, sandbox, basketball court, playgrounds, community gardens, and  there's even a chicken coop with real chickens next door"
"Nicest Basketball court in the neighbourhood. Unless you play at college level, your chances of getting some court time, during peak hours are nill."
Great to bring family and play a little pick up basketball.
A small park equipped with many sport courts and equipments.
Lovely place

My go to for a quick walk üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Enough tables and modes for kids. There is a school inside the park. Therefore recess during schooltime. If you want tranquility, I would not suggest this park, if you don't mind, it's beautiful spot"
"Quaint, and beautiful"
A lovely memories place to me. I was living by boulevard Pierre Bernard tetrauteville. A pieces of my Heart staying there. The park is clean. Fresh. Big. U can ride u bicycle. People is gentle. U can laydown by the grass. U can see the Saint laurent. Want to go back there someday. My favorite park place on east Montreal.

Great court. Always some dudes to throw down with. Kids can play in the park. Restrooms when open. Got shade too
Nice big park. Lots of youth playing sporting game.
Leaves fall all over the ground in autumn. Very beautiful
Nice place to play friendly basketball üèÄ there is a nice mural as well.
Cool park. Soccer field is not in good state and also the lights don't turn on to play until darker hours. Basketball courts are very nice and it's very near to the metro.
the basketball court is awesome (chain)
"Old Park, its installments have to be improved. The basketball court has to be revamped, it doesn't have equal leveling on both sides. Overall the whole park has to improved including the water circuit"
"It's an amazing parc that has several different play areas geared towards all age groups,there is also sprinklers,a basketball court with plenty of players for a pickup game.Plenty of shade in the parc,a soccer/baseball field attached.Lots of picnic tables & benches throughout the parc for picnics.Totally worth visiting.Only negative is that the bathroom on site is often closed..."
"A father was smoking Marijuana today , infront of his kids and others'.

More supervision is definitely required"
Accessible clean and the kids had a great time
"Green space, a park, a splash pool, basketball court (4 hoops) or just to sit on a bench. This space has something for all ages!"
Very nice location.
Nice atmosphere. Clean park.
"A very good basketball park, water themes, child park. Has a soccer field but only accessible during certain times with reservation. Not very busy so nice to relax when requiring solace."
Park really improved with years
"It's nice to see that the city put a bit of love in this park. I for one enjoy the diversity of the neighborhood in this park.
üëå Enjoy"
"Basketball court, water park, soccer field and playground! Few minutes away from Georges Vanier metro!"
"Great park area in Montreal. It is big comparing to other playgrounds in the area. You have many options for babies and toddlers, also another area for bigger kids (divided by a big space between them), so if you have small kids you won't have problems with big kids coming around. It has 2 basketball courts and a splashing pad for summer. You can bring snacks, cause they also have tables for sitting. I just didn't give 5 stars, cause you find some garbage and many squirrels trying to sneak food."
"Lovely Park for children and adults, there are water games, playgrounds and basketball and soccer courts"
I  lived in that area for 45 years.
good park fors  every bodys.
"Great spot for kids, lots of shade, basketball, splash park, etc. Filled with picnic tables, yet the icon for rules says no forks and knives (no food)? Stay down wind of cigarette-smoking parents if possible."
"Great atmosphere, very kid friend."
"GREAT park! I just wish the splash pad was a little more in the sun in the afternoon. This park has two sections for kids to play in, a basketball court, splash pad and a nice little sand box."
Courts could use a cleaning
Awesome place for the family especially with the addition of the water park. Great for hot summer days.
cud be biggest outdoor basketball courts close to downtown. idea: upgrade the courts from concrete to sport-floors tho. concrete very bad for joints. Also idea: add in a trekfit.ca park here
"A pritty nice place to play basketball. Sometimes, there are too many people in weekend afternoons."
Lovely place. Kids friendly
"Beat place for animal lovers.
You can get the chance to feed the reindeer.
They are wolves,foxs,bear,bison , artic wolves and many more."
"This is a very big park with 2 basketball courts and 1  baseball field. It also has a ping pong table, a very big splash pad surrounded by large rocks where parents can sit and watch their kids. There are 2 playgrounds separated by what used to be a wading pool (weeds have overgrown it and nothing has replaced it) and they are closed off by a fence on the side facing the street, with only 2 openings I believe. Because of the way the park was designed, you have very good visibility for watching your kids. The playground for babies and toddlers is very large with 6 swings and two sets of slide modules So even if there are a lot of people, it doesn't feel crowded. The only downside is that there are maybe 10 or less picnic tables. Otherwise, there's a lot of shading due to the many large trees and it is very clean. At the moment, the washrooms are not available due to renovations but there are 2 portapotties available. They city did a fantastic job revamping this park."
It's a great park for a young family and even great for an individual looking to shoot some  hoops.
Great for kids of all ages. Water play area in summer. ‚õ≤üëå
Grew up there it's so beautiful and peaceful now
Beautiful park...fenced in areas for the children. Not too sunny in the summer!

Great parc
Can't have enough parcs in a big city
It's under construction.
"This place is awesome, and very very huge. They have added a few young trees last year and it's going to be a very nice park in a couple of years. The park would need some love though, and it is a bit monofunctional. The first Avenue could be also more integrated and secure with the park, but it's going there.

P.S - big hill to slip during winter ! Very enjoyable for kids."
"Nice park, multiple activity like baseball, dog park, water fountain for kid, public swimming pool and more."
Cozy greenary park. There is a place for dogs.
Two wide lanes plus adventurous sledding off the side
Really good sledding hill and safety personnel / first responders were on site today just in case.
"Even though it was a very cold day, the sun was with us and the 2 skating rinks were ready.  Slides are also ready so bring the kids or friends to enjoy some nice winter fun."
"I loved,  there is a very fast tobogganing,  very nice for kids. Open until midnight."
"Great park with a public pool, multiple softball fields, kids playground and nice green grass. The park is also known for the sheeps eating the grass there in the summer. Definitely a nice place for good family time"

Very few picnic tables in the park. But it is a nice place to visir
Nice little park
Okay parc with lots of installation and the best sunset view
"This is a very nice park. They improve the place recently and feels good to go. Is very good to go with your family or alone to read a book. Its nice to go summer or winter. They have this big ""glissade"" in winter and in summer you can go and relax in that area."
Park is getting too sketchy with all the drinking going on from early morning until late at night.
Cool !
Nice place for family times!!
Great to make your kids run
Not too bad of a place if you have a dog.
The pool is great. Good temperature water too.
"Beautiful parc to work out, relax, have a picnic and even play baseball, basketball and more"
Wide park there‚Äôs a tall hill to sleigh on in the winter and in the summer there‚Äôs baseball fields if you feel like throwing the ball around.
A place for family. There is a dog run.
Very nice playground for the kids. People are super friendly there. My son always has a blast!

Swimming pool in summer. Great.
"Great dog park, lots of space, all the dogs were super friendly! Would recommend!"

"Ce parc est un tr√©sor pour la  relaxation,
Et pour vraiment relaxer.
Je le recommande √† tous.
C'est un beau petit parc dans rosemont."
"Amazing for photoshotgun and Good for walking, not for staying a long time, I take my friend there for taking a photos üì∏"
"Same hour: saw red bellied woodpecker, a  male mallard duck and his wife swimming in the semi frozen swamps, a hawk, a squirrel thinking he's a flying squirrel. Wild-life bio students or zoology students would have a field trip if they visited this place, literally. I really was just hoping for funky growths in the waters and definitely found some. So much tweeting, so many birds' mating rituals and ceremonies. Highly recommended if you're looking for a little magic away from the chaos."
"It's absolutely beautiful, a hidden gem in the city."
"The broken fence meant not to adventure a this spot. But search for ""passerelle japonaise"" that was spectacular! lost in the wood."
"I fall in love with this nature... Peaceful, virgin... I visited in spring and everywhere was green"
Great place to cross x ski snowshoe and walk. Kid friendly
Good for walking but not for picnic.
Beautiful walk in the middle of the city. Soothing!
"Very peaceful place, nature beauty everywhere. The fall color are outstanding!"
Great outdoors
"Beautiful, clean great views. Ducks everywhere, bike path walking path, walk along the riverside."
Very pretty spot.
Love my neighborhood
Very nice parc to walk into...or ride your bike!!!
A really very pleasant park for a country walk. Not many people know about this place (compared to the more refined parks elsewhere in the city). Great spot for a long walk and picnic.
So many mosquitos. Don‚Äôt go here unless you‚Äôre fully covered and took at bath in 100% DEET.
Great urban park for a walk and jogging
"Great nature park around the neighborhood.
Easy access"
"Wonderful park, amazing flora and fauna. Paths recently overhauled to allow flow of water and keep them dry. Just beautiful."
This place would be better if bicycle were allowed. Thanks to the people who  voted for this .Not!
Very nice and beautiful place to visit.
"This is more of a preserve than a park. It host a variety of local plants. Very natural wood setting. Serene. The area it quite small and secluded, between a train track, a residential area when you'll have to parc on the street to access it and the Gouin bl. A few years ago, a short walking path has been build to enjoy the woods. Access to the path is on the west end of Jean bourdon street."
Excellent place to take a walk alone or with people or pets. Summertime is the best time to visit but do not enter with much skin revealing as the mosquitoes are a pain in parc.
"They put down many many trees lately. Sadly, it breaks the heart because it is not anymore that nice like in the past."
Not bad
It's a very nice bike track out of the town
Nature in its glory. Beautiful pathway for nice walks with pets or children . Very clean with garbage bins.
Beautiful part with a lot of trees.

"GORGEOUS place, but. soooooo many mosquitoes!!!!! crazy. never going back there in shorts & sleeveless!"

It‚Äôs a very beautiful park in front of the school cinque continent. It has big play ground for the kids. For the adults there are football court and the softball. Comfortable seating arrangements around the water fountain makes it more attractive and comfortable too. It‚Äôs my one of the best park.
"Great place to enjoy some fresh air in the summer. Good for children play, picnics, refreshing water splashing and lounge, sports, baseball or just strolling around with your dog."
Very nice park with multiple variable swings and slides for all ages. Very big green space too for picnics. Strongly recommend.
"We love this park, it is not that big but big enough to feel surrounded by the green. There are a lot of benches to sit down and several picnic tables. Our kids love the big playground with the sand, and the water spouts. Or they just ride on their bikes. I would recommend this park if you are looking for a kids-friendly park!"
"People respect the environment, make use of the park with modesty and respect other users."
Nice park for all seasons! Kids friendly.
It's a small park but it's a good one
Nice park for hanging out with friends and family
"Nice quiet park. Beware, it gets very dark there during night time."
"Nice park, modern facilities. Has a playground, soccer field, green space, and a water park/splash pad."
"A good spot for entertainment, learning to skateboard, bringing your kids out for fresh air, and quite good area for picnics. Still you can feel your lungs aren't having much of a pure air still tight and the big polluted clouds are still over. Nonetheless, the area remains the refuge and the best place to go in the area."
Nice parc to go to for a walk during covid not many people there
"Big park for the neighbourhood. There is a kids area, picnic tables, playground, baseball field and water games during summer time."
A nice well located park with lots of space and many climbing structures and swings for kids
On any given Saturday evening in the summer this place turns into a multicultural family BBQ.  What an amazing place.
Great place to chill out and read a book or walk your dog. There's a small play area for kids too.. nice place to get some fresh air in the city
McDonald Park is a pretty big park right smack-dab in the middle of the west side of the city. it's been there for years and has a lot of square footage. You can see people doing all sorts of events in the park and they even put up a lighted skating that I could see for my tall luxury high-rise at night time. Very well lit. With nobody there most of the time.  at the North end of the park and I don't know why that in particular late but it seems to have a lot of dog walking people.it's like a circle of dog socialization but not a dog run nobody releases their dog off the leash or they shouldn't. It's a popular Park surrounded by residential homes and generally speaking it's fairly quiet with homes and church and synagogue kitty-cornering it in a couple of places.  We need more parks and open spaces in Montreal so it's great to have this one.
Perfect park to come a play with your kids. Its big a d have several play grounds with small water park.
Nice playground with sand: great splashpad and restrooms in the shelter.
McDonald park is an amazing place. Great I'd you have kids or want to soccer. You could have barbecue's and picnics there. Only downfall is that is close to busy streets
"Its a pretty big area. Better than most of the nearby parks. Have many activities, slices etc for children. Playground for both children and adults."
Some people forgot to clean up after themselves but there were park benches and rubbish bins to welcome picnicking.
"Lovely park, gorgeous large trees."
All that's missing is a dog park
Lovely city park with lots of green space and children's playground. Picnic tables are available.
"Very nice playground for toddlers and older kids. A waterpark is nextby and also toilets. I like it, because it has lots of trees that spend some shade and picnic tables."
"So nice to see the buds coming out and the cheese filling up with green and the park becoming green as well and now I remember why I love spring and summer and even fall... in Montreal.
These pictures were taken driving up or south Direction on the east side of the park."
"Good spot in the neighborhood for family activities, dogs welcome on leash."
"Beautiful park, children having fun,  the water park is partially not warking, it's very disappointing"
Great for kids and restrooms clean. Big playground for kids and well kept park in general. The waterpark is still under construction but expected to be finished by end of June
Best park in the area. A new water splash in summer 2018 made it even better.
Nice place to make a  a barbecue
open without restroom!
Very nice and big park located in NDG. They just renovated the cabin. Their is a splash park as well as sand area. The park is accessible by wheel chair. There is a special swing for people in wheel chairs with a strap to hold them in place securly.
Lovely park.
The kids love this park.
"Nice place, it has a water park for kids"
"Love this quiet, clean and beautiful open park. Perfect for small children. Small pool for children , Baseball ans soccer field."

Great quiet place
Beautiful parc
This park is a little hidden gem in NDG. It‚Äôs on the corner of Girouard and Monkland. It‚Äôs in close proximity to Villa-Maria metro station. There‚Äôs tons of choices for shopping bars and restaurants and all other sorts of activities located right on Monkland so this park has immediate access to a lot of stores.
Not mowed but shaded benches were welcomed on a hot day
"Viger Square was built to hide Autoroute Ville Marie, a major highway that crosses and divides Montreal's downtown. Built on top of the highway, it manages to hide large swaths of it and plays the more important role of keeping the upper and lower parts of downtown from being disconnected. The square has fallen on hard times and needs a major renovation. One interesting tidbit is the presence of large crabapple trees that carry edible fruit which ripens around the beginning of September."
Nice park.
Correct
Il faut √™tre prudent dans ce park...
"Very clean park and a lot of field to practice on (soccer, basketball, tennis, running tracks)"
"Extremely well maintained and clear paths *During winter, frozen over and cleared of snow for the perfect outdoor (and socially distant) local ice skating experience!

The path under the ice is in complete disrepair, despite this though all the facilities such as baseball park, Astroturf, basketball and tennis courts are all in top form"
Ice is not good..
Cool
"Baseball, soccer, tennis, course."
Amazing soccer ‚öΩ field but would help if there were any lights.

"Absolutely gorgeous! Children modular are so impressive, this parc have so much fun to offer. :)"
"Nice park to walk, run or admire the view near the water. You can walk your pet. Bring your kids, do a picnic, take pictures and videos. It's a place for the whole family. Summer time is a good location to go and do water sports."
"Simple, friendly park. It's kept up well and clean.j wish there were dog friendly areas."
Nice view. Riverside .. It is beautiful
Nice riverbank.
Nice play ground for kids
"Great small park with lots of activities for kids of any age. Great waterfall area where kids can play, rope activities to climb, good water fountains area and LOTS of tables and benches! Must visit with kids if nearby!"
"Lovely and quiet park in my neighbourhood. Very clean and well-kept. An ideal spot for picnics with friends, I come here regularly as I live in the area. If you have kids, the playground looks like it would be a blast for them. Great spot, highly recommend! #ccom315"
The playground isn't appropriate for younger kids. But overall it's a good park.
Little hidden park that's nice and quaint.
"Nice Park, completely different from the standard you expect and worth the stop. Says starting at 18month, but it is quite sketchy for that age"
Great place for kids and pleasant and peaceful environment for adults.
missing toilets
The rocking benches are amazing!
Lovely little renewed park in the plateau with a very contemporary fountain
A quiet parkette to eat your Schwartz's famous smoked meat sandwich.
"There's probably little reason for most Montrealers or visitors to come to this park, unless they happen to be in the neighborhood. Its views could potentially be good, but are very often blocked by metal containers and freight trains that ‚Ä¶"
"Amazing place to hangout out of Riverside Ships train tracks awesome vibes small small eating spots, people's taking precautions to covid, loved the place I recommend you to visit it's the best place to visit in evening with your friends.  Beautiful view of Jacques Cartier Bridge Saint Laurent River"
"I found out about this place through a website, but it was such a great call to go. It is a bit far from other things, but I‚Äôd go back and stay in the evening for some shows or just the vibe itself. There is a sense of community and ‚Ä¶"
"Sandy, often wet, crowded and LOTS of smokers, also, don't watch the fireworks there, the music is not in sync but delayed. And even though there's a non-smoking area, since it's an open space, smoke gets carried by the wind... and I wouldn't bring kids there because of the loud music also. Nice ambiance but not for everyone."
Cute rollerblading spot freshly paved seen a whale there once
"This is becoming a staple in Montreal summer scene.
Very easy access, river view. Excellent vantage point for summer fireworks.

Plenty of room to play, dance and relax.
Very kid friendly.

Food and drinks available.

The afrotonik night is the best one."
"If you want to enjoy the fireworks comfortably with your family, go here.If you take a mat and a camping chair, it will be more enjoyable.Alcoholic beverages are not allowed during the fireworks."
Fun place to go to. They have different restaurants where to eat and a bar. A stage where some groups can perform and beach like vibes.
"Been coming here the last 3 years but the space isn't as exciting this year. No second floor, no hammocks in the back so 1 star off.

Still, a cool free outdoor space and when the fireworks restart again it'll be really fun to go Saturdays. ‚Ä¶"
"Perfect spot to watch the fireworks, always fun things to check out, concerts, food trucks,"
"It's an awesome project built by a highly motivated organism called La P√©pini√®re | Espaces Collectifs. Le Village au Pied-du-Courant is a reinvented public space built anew every year during summer by a collective effort.

"Will definitely be going there many times this summer. I love the recycled pieces of fun and funky furniture and art installements all around. So many cool things to see. It's such a Montreal thing to do, but it's why you have to love this ‚Ä¶"
"Had a great night at the event, was full because it was the last Saturday of fireworks. People danced on the sand and chilled with the great views. A little prices but it's a good location, the only thing is they cut the music exactly at the time they have stated. Guess they stick with the rules."
Great place to go to chill with friends! During the day it is family friendly and at night they sometimes are DJ sets that are really enjoyable! Make sure to check their schedule before going!
Lovely little beach party near the water with railway background noise from trains passing by to make for a unique atmosphere. All paid for (beside your choice of poison) by the tax payers so basically... free ;)
Maybe I shouldn't write this review to keep this gem all to myself! What a wonderful spot to watch the fireworks!!
"It's a very pretty place, good for insta pics. It's nice that there are always parked food trucks. But I went for the boogie night and the music wasn't at all what I expected (it was electro and not 80's )‚Ä¶"
It has some great live music and an amazing energy! It is also a great place to watch some fireworks from
"good place for many event: watching fireworks, DJ performance, food ..."
"Beauriful scenic area, Montreal is just stunning"
Great for warm summer days. They have food and drinks too.
Awesome outdoor venue for a summer night! There is food and drinks available and lots of seating areas. There's sand in a lot of areas too making it almost like a beach. There's a small stage where they play music. It's like having an open air bar. If you want to have fun outside on a warm night this should be one of your first options!
"Top ! always lively. Affordable drinks with live music and a beachy chilling area. The smell of a BBQ or whatever other food stand still lingering in the air. Catch the last summer rays, the last prickling warm sunsets here. Very cool project by Montreal of recommissioning space. Only catch is getting there..."
A little corner of South beaches vibes in town. Loved it!
"SUCH a nice place to watch the international fireworks!! It's amazing that there are so entrance fees! And the music is very nice, the vibe is so very beachy-like and relaxed.
The beers are fairly priced (10 for 2 cans)!! Super nice place ‚Ä¶"
"Was expecting some type of street food available for purchase. Sadly there was none, so we left. Nice atmosphere though, and you can bring dogs, so that's cool."
"Great place to relax and get some food and a drink, enjoy the Sun under the bridge"
Different DJ every time. Decent drinks though mildly expensive (as expected). Great place to meet up with a group of friends. You could spend an evening there. Bathrooms are portapotties and were gross.
Music was way too loud but otherwise super fun atmosphere. Great food. Fireworks looked amazing from this spot.
"Quaint little restaurant, very close to the Atwater Market and other amenities the food is super delicious."
"This is a great place to meet up with friends and enjoy great music and food. It is located right in front of the famous amusement park La Ronde, so on summer evenings you can watch the fireworks too! There are many bathrooms as well as kid ‚Ä¶"
These grounds were used for the CAVALIA SHOW; easy to get to.
"What a great festival! Food, drinks, music, stalls to buy specialities of country of the day, all on a created beach. Really enjoyed my time there!"
Great views for social distancing with family
Great ambiance.  Kid and dog friendly plus free entrance. Cannot ask for more.
Attended a brooklyn block party here. Felt like I was the only tourist there as it turned out to be an actual party for the neigbourhood. Awesome crowd. Awesome party. And fireworks.
Very nice place to enjoy a picnic!
Another great year!  I always love visiting La Village and I look forward to next year.
The best discovery i've made in my city. Truly a gem!
"Incredible ambiance. Music, food, drinks, fireworks multi-cultural... it's the perfect place for summer events!!!"
"Nice place to meet up with friends, have a drink, listen to good music and chill outdoors. You can even bring your dog (as long as on leash)!"
Great free place to see the fireworks. Just get here early so you get a good view.
"Nice summer party, the line to the bar is long tho ... Order at least too drink at the time if you want to enjoy your night :)"
"Looked like a nice setup from what I could gather with the little visual I had (it was night time). Impossible to get drinks and food, you're easily waiting 2 hours just to get served."
Beautiful fireworks. Even on hot days there's a nice breeze since it's near the river.
Funky cool spot sandy play areas for the kids and turned into a dance club laterüëçüòÅ
Amazing energy. Lovely to be there and we need only more activities for the kids üíöüôè
Great spot to watch the fireworks and enjoying the evening
"Nice chill place with a nice vibe! Every Friday there is a different theme night and music, arabian, carribean, etc... Just by the water as well with a nice view of Jacques Quartier bridge and La Ronde (Six Flags)..."
Cool spot to watch the fireworks ! You can also get on the bridge by foot to watch them.
Awesome spot. Friendly and welcoming crowd.
I went by for Saint-Jean baptiste. Horrible band and no ambiance really. Very disapointed. I will try again when there's a better party..
"We went for the asian night market, very nice"
Good times! Good vibes ! Good music !
Super relaxed place. The best location to see La Ronde fireworks outside la Ronde.
"The village is good until it caters for the young and the hip for a commercial purpose...

Music is ok. But what‚Äôs with the sand? Why are they trying to make a Beach Club out of it? The revitalising project is very good, and its pet ‚Ä¶"
I love this place. Can‚Äôt wait for summer again!

I hope whatever sorcery the team that does these urban projects use is a limitless resource.  Their spaces are unique and community focused.  Cool people hang out here - be cool.
Great place for a drink and to watch fireworks
"Nice plce to check-in, and enjoy the view"
"There is nothing amusing about Pied-du-Courant. There are barely any activities, most are geared towards children. The food options are limited and the music was just the same beat repeating during the whole time I was there. I was ‚Ä¶"
"Best spot for fireworks. There are tons of ad panels, though..."
Great place to watch the Fireworks üéä Drinks and snacks near by!üé∂
"An amazing addition to Montreal in the summer. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are well priced and they have a good variety as well. The music is usually pretty fun and there is enough space just to chill or dance your ass off."
My main reason to go there is to see the fireworks in summer.
Good place to relax.
"We loved it. The decor is unique, the music good and the crowd is alive. We had fun!"
It was great. But no tp in the johns
The best place to watch the fireworks outside of La Ronde
I‚Äôm giving this a three because it got way too busy and the things always take forever to get to - if you want to wait 2 hours in line for an activity where the goal is to do something that takes 30 mins then go ahead. But I also gave this three because it was something fun to do with the right people.
Good times! Good vibes ! Good music ! Summer hurry back
Lots of people. The food truck festival not my cup of tea. (No pun intended) prices were high and quality was mediocre.
"I think it's one of the best place to watch the fireworks during the ""Festival International des Feux Loto QUEBEC"". You can bring your food, bbq. Best view!"
"Great place to drink, dance and know people. Go and lose yourself!"
"Very cool ambiance and views of the light show on Jacques Cartier bridge and of La Ronde. Lots of chill places to sit, and I love that it is dog friendly üêïüê©üê∂"
Very pinterest worthy with all the decor and the lights. Great music to dance to and a perfect place to enjoy with friends. Awesome lookout for the fireworks.
Good spot to watch the International Fireworks Competition in the summer
"A cute small area which is almost beach-like at the edge of the St-Lawrence river. I went for the Mexican festival. There is a very small public garden, and some nice views of Jacques-Cartier bridge, La Ronde, and Montreal. There are many events here almost every day. Family friendly."
"Interesting location for fringe events, however too enclosed and crowded for large scale, popular ones. Transit options and parking also limited. On the plus side, nice views of the bridge, especially lit up at night, plus flexible setup for kiosks, bar, music stage, etc."
"Big crowd for fireworks. Food trucks, live music all around good vibes."
"Best place to have a beer, relax on the ""beach"", and watch the fireworks for free!"
"While I applaud the concept, I find it hard to enjoy what is really a cleaned up dumpster with trash standing for kids toys."
"Sometimes we go here to get some food from food trucks and enjoy the music from the DJ.  There's also things for kids (and adults) to play.  Great spot for fireworks, although it can get crowded on the weekend.  Drinks are also served here."
It was good. Went there to watch fireworks üéÜ
"always a fun time! and FREE! such beautiful work by volunteers, and food is available."
"Been there for the Asian Night Market, was busy but it is a very chill, welcoming and creative place. Will definitely go there again and edit this review!"
park where you van see the bridge and the water divide
Greta place with neat choice of food and drinks! Best spot to watch the fireworks for free!
Don't go. No point. Boats all cover the view of the space
Lovely place!
Love the artsy yet kid friendly vibe.
Decor isnt as nice as last years but still lovely place to spend an afternoon and have a picnic.
Fun place to go and grab a beer. Good DJs music. Sandy area. Good spot to watch the fireworks.
It's really a nice place to hang out
A beautiful place to hang out when the weather is nice
"It's ok. Maybe I was expected more from this place. Unfortunately for me it isn't very relaxing there cz it is between port, bridge and highway. It was pretty boring. I didn't find chairs and chaise-longue  comfortable. Was difficult to ‚Ä¶"
Good place to watch fire work and lighting on the bridge. Popular for summer activities. But very busy area.
A best location to watch the summer fireworks competition.
"Hugs to Ben, my man! And the crew is awesome, and events are cool. Come hang out at night, its free."
"The emplacement is amazing for fireworks , its family friendly but there's no space to change baby ,the sand should be clean more often there's a lot of cigarettes butt on it its ridiculous . But for casual evening with friends I do recommend this place"
"Great amenities and DJs. People were friendly and respectful, truly a place to wind off without judgment and have fun. Relaxation areas to talk, dance floor on the sand, observation decks and food\drink stands available."
"A summer lasting event with a great view of the newly illuminated Jacques Cartier bridge. Food, art, music and fun."
"I really like this place, super fun to hang here with friends with such a great atmosphere...!"
Nice place to have and drink and envoy a night outdoor!
"Nice spot, clean, with great ambience, the food trucks offers a wide variety of choices, great service!"
"Great time on the mini beach, a lovely community of bars and food, very family friendly but with some good tunes too"
Open June-September. Unique urban beach and off the beaten track with great views of the Jacques--Cartier Bridge and the river. Bar and food trucks on site.
"Fantastic place . We came across this Urban beach while looking at events on Facebook.  What a discovery !  The events usually start mid day around 2pm until 12 am . Staff is very friendly and helpful .

Great spot to watch the fireworks in the summer.
Very nice spot. Great for kids. Great food when food yrucks are about
For Someone that needs a Daily Doze of SUN I highly recommend this place and its hammocks.  My little Paradise.
"Best for watching fireworks at La Ronde.

This is the best view you are going to get without actually being in the park across the water and getting stuck in heavier traffic."
"BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL park, and its is huge, right on the side of the st-laurent river and has some amazing views, great for a run, bike ride or picnic"
Nice place to chill during summer time and grab a drink. Perfect spot where to see La Ronde fireworks during summer.
Best place in the city to catch the fireworks.
Check out the themed events during summer. Great place to hangout and often has free concerts. Its also free for all activities and entrance.

Nice place to relax and promenade
"This is another world, if you live in a city and arrived at this island which is just a few hundred feet from a main Street.
The island is hidden from street view until you arrived. Plenty of hardwood trees. You passed a gate crossing a bridge , then you are inside the forest. No more city in sight or city noise.
If you keep going straight, you will find a river at the north end. You can see the Laval at the other side.
You are now in a piece of natural forest by a river, all by yourself.
Think about anything you want to see in a country, Canada goose, duck and all kinds of birds, if you stay, they will come and visit you.
By the end of the island at the west side, there are even bicycle parking.
Park your bike and have a walk by the river bank if it fits you well.
I love it so much."
"Beautiful place in the summer not so nice in the spring due to the water level but love it nevertheless, I go there quite alot"

J'adore ce parc.  Beaucoup d'arbres et plusieurs bancs pour s'asseoir
Cool park to play tennis or play some soccer. Also good to go with friends and/or family to just chill or to have some bbq.
Nice park. I go there for the tennis courts. They‚Äôre not in perfect condition but playable
Nice tennis courts. Very new and well maintained
"Lot of facilities to play sports like tennis, soccer, football etc."
Nice big park
"My kids like going here to play tennis. There is a illuminated soccer/football field for use in the summer, ice rinks in the winter. Play parks for the young ones. A recently refurbished clubhouse. Overall a nice park for the family. Parking isn't too difficult but it can be at times. Personally I would like to see a splash pad for the kids."
"Great park, nice fountain however grass could be maintained better"
"More of a square than a park. Benches and tables but the grass isn't great for a picnic. Also very shady. Nice central fountain, when it's turned on."
"Many tenis courts, playground for kids, soccer and football fields, and spot to relax."
I wish that it would become a dog park üòï
The big soccer court is always closed. The other one that we have to play is completely full of holes and almost no grass. The tennis courts are well treated. The park itself is a good place to make a bbq and full of nice people. There is also a playground for the kids.
"Great place for everyone to enjoy peace & love forever lasting enjoy ALL age's peace God bless Verdunüåèüåêüòéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíçüèù‚õ™üë™üíèüèúüéÜüéáüåãüèïüèùüòòüòé G ,MJ üòòüçáüçáüòçüòç üòçüíñüíïüíëüë≠üòÅüòéüòáüíí‚òù"

Nice soccer field.
"Been coming here since the mid 70's when Ecole Secondaire Louis Riel was used as training center for the 1976 Olympics and it's 3 soccer fields (at the time) has made the park a hub for Montreal soccer for decades.
If your kids play soccer in Montreal and they play vs MHM, you will be coming here eventually.
Presently Parc Louis Riel has one lit turf  11v11 soccer field, one grass 9v9 and 3 grass 7v7 fields. There's also 2 lit softball fields, a kids park, a lot of nicely lit tennis courts, a small running track and it's pleasant to walk around. It's very well kept, in a safe neighborhood about 10mins walk to the Langelier metro.
If you want to get something to drink or eat from the park, you can walk 10 mins south to Sherbrooke E. street or 10mins north to Beaubien street."
Nice cozy little park for hanging around. Great for kids.
Good place for exercise and play fun.
Nice place to play tennis. Courts have been remodeled. But no light. So gotta come earlier.
"I go to this park for Tennis lessons. The courts are well maintained, there is a water fountain, portable washroom and benches to sit. There are very often a group of people playing dominos next to the courts. Parking is free."
Very nice park I will come back here for sure
racist
My favorite spot in Montreal to play tennis. Avoid going week day mornings since half of the spots are reserved for youth practice. Apart from that the courts are perfect.
High quality park with many different sport options available
A park to enjoy most sports as well as a track for running. It is big and has really nice trees.
Very good place for kids.
Alot of activities super clean and beautiful

"Clean, calm and looks new. Amazing"

"great soccer field.

No reasonable bathroom options..."

Excellent park and kids friendly

People are smoking around the soccer and baseball fields ... why having a bylaw if nobody is there to enforce it.
Nice park
"There are several soccer pitches, tennis courts, kids play area, and a baseball pitch."
"J'adore mon parc, j'y vais a tous les jours mais il y vraiment trop de voiture qui ce prom√®ne entre le terrain soccer, baseball, et tennis. depuis 1 mois sa fait 3 personne que j‚Äôavertis et essaye de savoir pourquoi il ce permettre de rouler dans le parc. tous des gens agressif qui ne veulent pas trainer leur mat√©riel de sport jusqu'au terrain."
"This is the best place by far to skate, run, jog, walk, have picnics and meet people of all walks of life. I've been at this place on 4 different occassion, just seated close to the street to watch people have fun, while listening to afrobeat music.

But today I decided to take a walk around, and was astonished at how big and well maintained the place is. It's now my go-to place for running and walking. I really love everything about this place. Hoping to meet people and make friends there"
"An extremely large park with running spaces, cycling and party spots. The environment is mesmerizing. It's popular for friends hangout, and family outdoor party."
"Beautiful large spacious parc. Although its a popular parc, there is a lot of space an its not over crowded. There are toilets open during the pandemic, functioning water fountains and If you know, dance parties."
If this humongous park would have sort of a lake or any body of water it would be a 5 star park. Shame they didn't design one. We can only hope. Also more trees would be nice.
I wish people would be more careful with the cyclists as some areas are shared for walking and cycling. Would also be nicer if some cyclists didn't believe they were on race tracks.
Such a beautiful and quiet place to visit. You will fall in love immediately.
"It's huge and beautiful! Even when it's busy, you can find a secluded spot. When somewhere in the middle of the park, it doesn't feel like you're in the city, I love it!"
"It's so beautiful, quiet ,clean with a lot of space. Suitable for social distance."
"Beautiful, large park in the middle of the city. Nice for relaxing, picnic. Lovely place"

"Love this parc, big enough have a lot a space for picnics and barbecue. I love walking there with my dog"
Beautiful place . It's a really big park but no amusements for children.  You'll have to bring some.
One of the nicest and natural park in Montreal at 2 min of the jardin botanique
"Giant park of Eastern Montreal, with tons of activities summer like winter.
The park is so big it's like you never feel it's Crowded.

A wide and beautiful park close to Olympic stadium

Dedicated trails and paths for walking and cycling. A few hills near Sherbrooke and Viau street. Nice view of the Olympic tower from afar. The only thing is that the park is too flat but that's just me."
A nice place for recreation.
"Very large and peaceful. Nice for walking, running, skiing and more."
"Big, beautiful, and very well maintained!"
A lovely bike path goes through this park. And there is so much space that you feel like you're outside of the city. Also in the summer the thing they do with the sheep is awesome for kids! If you're lucky there is free street parking on Boulevard Rosemont.
"This is the best place for social distancing ! Enjoy the fresh air, firm up those leg muscles and avoid the virus."
Great huge ice skating circuit. It was a mknday afternoon and there was a LOT of chipped ice and snow and it was a bit bumpy. I guess they dont pass the zamboni every day
"Simply amazing, you can pique-nique,  exercise,  meet with friends.  The only cons I see is the bathroom, there are not many in the park, you have to walk long distance and not sure if they are open."
Must visit park if you are living in Montreal‚ò∫Ô∏è
I am not giving 5 stars because it lacks bathrooms!
Beautiful place with so much space to exercise or to enjoy some fresh air with friends or family.
The bathroom situation during covid is really awful
Great place to roller blade or bike around.  With nice shaddy places to relax in.  Next to the Olympic Stadium.
Always a nice park to visite. So big that social distancing is not a problem!
I love this parc
"Extremely large park, and such few people. Big variety of trails"
What a beautiful huge park!
Nice park all year round!
"I am disappointed with the clinic.  They followed my 2 cats for over 3 years now. Last week, I needed them to see my cat and they charged me as an emergency.  They change the politics, they only accept emergencies now and they didnt advice. I left the clinic with an invoice of almost 500$. They explained to me that they could not advise about the change because they lost all files, however they had mine in the system... üòï"

"This is an incredible park for the family with tons of space. A tranquil gem in the city! There are trails dedicated to running and walking as well as dedicated biking trails. There are nice sections of large trees with plenty of shade and open spaces perfect for enjoying the sun! There are nice facilities, with water and some vending snacks as well as picnic benches and sitting structures along the trails. If you are lucky, you might stumble upon the sheep as they munch the grasses. This is also a great place to bird watch within city limits! During the winter, you can cross country ski or snowshoe with the family :)"

Fun place with a nice view
This Park is so beautiful and has a lot of space!!
Insanely huge park with hidden ecosystems & the casual sheep.
This park is marvelous!! Great for a tandem bike ride with ton chum ou ta blonde! You will truly feel like you are immersed in a forest. The only sign of civilisation is the top of the giant Olympic toilet bowl peering out over the trees. J'capote l√†. C'est vraiment hot.

Nice park for a Picnik
Very large park
Good park for outdoor activities
"Great outdoor space in Montreal. Good for running, walking, biking or just enjoying a picnic in the park."
This place is very very nice and i advise you to visit it.
"Arrived on site for an event to find a car broken into. We immediately report it to the park security, who dont care and say it is the police's problem. We then report it to a passing patrol car, who doesn't care because we don't own the vehicle and just leaves the remainder of this person's belongings unprotected. Finally we get it announced at the event as a last desperate attempt to help this person,who I'm certain had a much worse day than us. So obvious these people aren't here to protect us...."
Wonderful for  everyone!
"I mean, it's a big park. It's pretty during autumn too."
"I used to run there when I was living nearby,  I have so many memories out there.  You can chat with your friend while walking as well as have a lovely picnic."
"Walking, running, biking, picnic and bbq, play sports, walk and run with your pets, it can all be done in this incredibly big park filled with nice spots to enjoy some quiet time or interact with other people. Whatever you enjoy you can do in this park. On average I have never seen this park completely full or packed unless it was a festival. If you search well enough you might just get lucky and find yourself a spot to make you forget you are in the city. ENJOY!!!"
"A large park that extends a few city blocks. Part of the park was used for the marathon race in September. Has a stadium at one end, trails, and lots of space to enjoy nature in the middle of the city. Well kept and maintained."
Big and well maintained park.
"Such a grand, gorgeous and peaceful place"
"Nice huge park, love it."

Nice bike tour
One of my visits
"Beautiful huge park to relax and feel away from the city and noise , multiple bixi stops, close the wide open green space are very nice"
"It is named in honour of¬†Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, founder of Montreal.
The park is a unique place where people enjoy walking day or night, bicycling on its bike trail which runs all the way around the park.¬†It has been the site for¬†Montreal's annual¬†F√™te Nationale du Quebec concert and festivities. It is a place for politico-social events and gatherings."
Lovely park to enjoy with family and do a beautiful walk!

Great good place for jogging üòâ
"Good place, lot of space for kids to play.
Bbq is allowed too."
"Was able to get lost in it for 8 years!

That's a lot to say for a Montreal park.

Edit: sorry for the security guard who will find my cabin. Started only by a day off in the park and ended up living in my cabin for 8 years. 1 days was rough but then i build my little shelter little by little. First it was only a roof, then i build a wall (big DT fan here), then i wanted a window so i build one. Then came the bathroom and washroom, then a couple of person came in so i built a group room, then had a vending machine company get some profit from my cabin and since came by i gave them water fountain. Now its a great little cabin located right in front of the Saputo stadium, on the other side of the street.
Still amazed i got away with it and it still secret to the authority. Hope nobody find it because its my little secret place. Come by if you want a quick drink or anything. Its open to everyone!"
"One of my favourite park, for walking, jogging, cycling, roller skating and many other activities"
"I loved the place,it is a place in which you can relax,meet new people, do berbecue..."

nice place to lounge about in the summer!
Wonderful place to take a long walk.
"Best place for a picnic, bike laps or sheep finding!"
Great place and park for picnic and any activities
"This is the giant park next to the old olympic stuff.  It looks like they took all of that area and decided to turn it into green space.  The only problem with this area is the parking.  There really isn't any free parking to enjoy the park.  So end up having to pay for parking.  But once you have, there is a LOT of space for you you to hike and enjoy the outdoors."
"Beautiful place to do exercise, have a good time with friends, date or whatever comes in your mind."
"Safe for the moment.
Name should be changed to Park Maghreb."
Poor staff

Beautiful location for a fundraising event.
One of the greatest parcs on the island!! Lived beside there for years still haven't been able to cover the whole parc. And you have to try the sky lanes in the winter time.
Beautiful open space
"Nice big open space for running, cycling or walking."
We just finished our walk in the park and saw a few downed trees. I can just imagine what it like elsewhere.
Green oasis in the middle of the city
It excellent. Maintained very well.  I plan to revisit .
"Great place to enjoy a sunny day. Lots of possible activities you can do here: bicycle or rollerblade in the bike path, play ball on the grass, sun tanning, hold a kids party, have a pic nic, bring your barbecue, run, etc...."
"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!
Cycling path, runners paths, walkers path, and it's sooooo huge. There's a lot of place to go picnic or do whatever you want without even bothering any of the other visitors.
It's perfect and I love it. I go there everytime I want to pass an afternoon out under the sun while reading, doing some yoga, meditation, outdoor workout or whatever, really.
It's by far my favorite parc of Montreal. Big trees and a lot of open space for activities or tan a bit.
<3<3<3<3<3<3"
Peacefull and great to walking arround. Fun family time !
This is my favourite Parc in Montreal. You can bring your dog. It's huge. There is a place for bike. And they take care all the time. It's clean. You feel outside of town in the middle of the Parc.

The best parc ever!
"It was my first time here and I was coming from saint-laurent (about 20 km). That is not worth the distance. A large part of the parc is not accessible (botanic garden and other stuff). The royal mount is much much better, more natural."
"Massive park. Large green spaces, lots of bike paths and trees. Love this place!"
"Beautiful, calm and very big park... good for having fun and or zen time!"
An incredibly big park that rivals even Mont-Royal as the nicest park in Montreal. Beautiful gardens and sceneries.
I really like that park for rollerblading or biking as the bikepath is in really good shape and allows you to enjoy your ride.
It is like you are far away from the city and at The same time you are on The middle of the city Amazing place

Should have more washroom on each street and cafeteria or water fountains.
Great walking and bicycle paths
Nice park

It's lovely!
Wow
"Great for a quiet romantic time, √† BBQ with friends, a family party, kids b'day celebration. You can bring your BBQ and your dog!!"
Considering the park was closed for most of last year partly to resurface the pavement for rollerblading and bicycling there are alot of sections of pavement that are on bad shape...Disappointed...

Don't miss this.
Nice park
Magnificent !
Excellent
"Vraiment un bijou au pied du Stade Olympique et voisin du jardin botanique.  Sa topographie trahit un peu son ancienne vocation, mais les cyclistes autant que les pique-niqueurs y trouvent leur compte.  Un plan d'eau compl√®terait √† merveille le portrait.  Rien n'est parfait."
Quand m√™me plus propre que j'aurais pense et tr√®s vaste! Belle place pour un pic nique
Je m en lasserai jamais de cet si √©norme parc. Excellent pour la famille et on se sent m√™me pas pr√®s des rues ou m√™me aucune maison en vue quand on est au beau milieu du parc.
Meilleur parc pour aller courir. Le tour est un tout petit peu moins que 3km c'est parfait pour faire des 3km ou 9km ou un semi.
"Parque grande, muy hermoso, perfecto para un pic nic, hacer bicicleta, jugar y pasar un rato de calidad."
Un beau et grand parc pour les familles sans oublier les barbecues
5 √©toiles pour le parc mais pourquoi il y maintenant un DJ avec un gros syst√®me de son √† chaque fois que j'y vais? C'est quand m√™me annoying.
Grand parc avec possibilit√© de beaucoup d'espace pour faire des trucs nice
"Grand, s√©curitaire,propre!
Je nai jamais eu de probl√®me"
Tres grand et besu
Grand espace nature ou on peut √™tre a bonne distance des autres
Beau grand parc. Beaucoup de feteux.
Tr√®s agr√©able et beaucoup d espaces verts
Tr√®s grand parc nature en plein Montr√©al! Tr√®s beau!
Un bon endroit pour marcher
"Fast slopes to slide! Plus, we were alone! Really fun!"
Nice clean green grass.  And not much else. Good place to roam about with my little dog cause we can see from far off if any other dogs are header our way.
Excellent place for families!
"Very calm, and nice for sliding on snow"
Took the kids sledding and it was great!  Wish we had gone years ago!!
It's a good place to go whether you're alone or accompanied and is peaceful.
Beautiful park for the family
Nothing here really
"Small park, sliding in winter."
Tiny park but it has great views and great sunsets over the river
"Place to chill, playground for kids, pin pong table, splash pad."
Nice park. Small but fun for a 4 year old. No washrooms.
Great for kids. 2 playing areas; 1 for younger and 1 for older kids. There's also a small basketball court (1 hoop)
"Nice park, a lot of play options for kids of different ages. It has a fountain for kids to play in during the summer. I also like that there is a lot of seating throughout the park even during the colder months. For such a wonderful park they're isn't usually that many people which is also a plus."
It's a nice quiet place to bring your children
"Fabulous park! Ping pong table, splash pad in the summer, LOTS of benches & picnic tables for the little ones and families, benches galore, great kiddie park, ample green space and my dog loves it too!"
Alot of space and water park for kids
Great pit stop for the little ones but no bathroom facilities.
Great outdoor park
"Another one of those places in Montreal where you go and feel, TOO MUCH CONCRETE!!!"
It's awesome
"Ok.

Play areas need more shade."
Beautiful
"Nice park, too bad there's ton of traffic on the busy street around it."
It's a good place to relax or even exercise...Really good for kids and adults...I love being there..I go there almost every day...
Amazing plastic floor that grips
Cool
Amazing parc
Good
ü§òüèæüëåüèæ
Super parc et les gens son super üíù
Love the place.  Walk the dogs there every morning.  Don't like the bikes riding through there.  They are suppose to walk not ride.
"Very good park to go for a walk and relax. The park is divided into two sections separated by Henri-Bourassa Blvd. The first section has basketball and tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, indoor ice-skating arena, outdoor swimming pool and a small skating park. In January 2021, a pond has frozen forming an outdoor ice skating field. The second and smaller section has a track for walking and relaxing. Both sections have a playground for small children, benches and areas for picnic."
"They just built a new play structure for toddlers and older kids.it has different musical instruments attached to it. Also very big walking paths with trees, water and different art pieces around."
2-3 years ago it was cleaner and better maintained.
"Nice park for a stroll. The only problem is that some people along with their children don't follow the social distancing guidelines. Also, many people walking don't wear masks or follow social distancing when other people are coming from the opposite direction."
Nice pl√†ce to walk and  do the activities
Love this place. I live nearby and we go very often .
Very nice
Table a picnic.
There are not many children's games
"Very well maintained grounds, excellent tennis court surfaces. Went at 10:15 am on a Sunday and only had a 10 minute wait for a court."
A very nice park!!
"It‚Äôs amazing. It has a small skate park, a football field, a basketball field, a baseball field, a tennis terrain, an ice-skating rink and a pool (olympic + baby + water games). It also has two spots for children to play with slides and such and to even play with some musical instruments as well. It has a cute little bridge and some ‚Äúcultural‚Äù spots for Phoenicians. It is also like any other park: green with benches and picnic tables. Almost in the middle, there is a big empty space that one can be creative with. It doesn‚Äôt end there! There is a forest with several entrances! It‚Äôs like one moment you‚Äôre in the street, the other you‚Äôre lost in some interesting and mysterious place coming out of a movie. I explored most of it, but I didn‚Äôt go deep into the ‚Äúforest‚Äù because it was beginning to get dark. I am totally in love with this place. Almost forgot: there‚Äôs also a community garden (and maybe a museum, I am not really sure about the museum because I didn‚Äôt check it out)."
Like all the other parks in this area they are boring. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the green spaces but can we use them. There are so many parts of this park that are just never used. Can they put at least walking paths through them and if you venture through them beware of dog poop. There are a lot of dogs in this neighbourhood why not give them a fenced in area
ok
It still a nice and a very good place to spend some natural time so far. Place is clean and very well organized. For the last 3 times i went there for a walk then i did not notice anything to complain about. Hopefully the situation will remain like that for a long time
"Beautiful park with small playground and mutiple artworks. Great for jogging, walking, strolling or chilling.

Well lit and very busy. Typically there is plenty of parking. Many benches and great for a nice summer walk, picnic or sports. More then enough grass for multippe soccer matches."
I love this park.
Wandering
"There is a community garden with 200 plots, tennis courts, a baseball diamond, an astroturf soccer field, skateboard ramps, a skating rink in the arena and outside during the winter. There's a fair bit of garbage that gets mowed instead of picked up, the swings need painting, and dog owners let their dogs off the leash to terrorize joggers, and we could do with an exercise area for adults...but it's still pretty great park."
"Good park cant say its not good, the only problem is that sometimea the park is very crowded with kids and their parents."
a bit dirty but its fun
A nice park for walks alot of greenery.
"Great park in the summer, lots of green space, but the City needs to do something so that it is of some usefulness for winter activities."
"It is an amazing park with many play structures for kids of all ages. Even on hot summer days it is a great place because the trees are so big the entire area is shaded as well as a splash pad, wading pool, and full size pool."
"Well maintained. Arena. Soccer, baseball. Pool, tennis!"
Nice big clean park with ample parking for small events. Has both a baseball and soccer field along with the usual park stuff
"Nice park to go with family. In the summer they have the pool open for free. They have Arena for ice skating. They have 2 soccer field , baseball, basketball,tenis, and skate parc. Highly recommand it"
"Fairly new, convenient location gets 4 stars because overcrowded."
Love this park
Fine but right on the corner of 2 boulevards.
Good park for hikes and biking and relaxing
"Very big park with sport facilities, kids parks, and a great walking or jogging path, however the park is cut into two by giant and busy Boulevard Henri-Bourassa (young kids need supervision)"
Beautiful park with lots of kids and families.
Beautiful space for the kids and many more places to practice sports and activities
"Decent, but certainly not the best Montreal has to offer"
Nephew plays soccer there. Great spot for soccer game
We wish there was a public washroom there!
Lovely park
"Large park, good amount of paths and places to sit and play stuff for kids."
There are common play grounds for kids as well as adults.
Cool
Good facilities but without sand
"Great arena, but very little parking so be wary"
I wasn't  there but... it rains so... it's wet.
Nice
Has all the facilities for anyone to enjoy a park.
Awesome park.
Decent rink. A little cold though.
Nice park love the soccer field
"Nice park, great for kids, always crowded."
Amazing Place for the  Family.

Nice park always clean
Nice place for some relaxing
"Nice big park, lots of different sections, also used for festivals"
Nice park for kids
Not much to see but there are 4 PokeStops and a Gym.

"Love that green space in the neighborhood. I would like to have more trees there, but it's nice how it is now."
"Situated right behind a couple of buildings that are occupied by various offices of the municipality of Montreal, Champ-de-Mars is called a park probably because of a lack of a better term to describe it. I would describe it as a public space that consists of no more than one long alley/walkway, a row of poplar trees, a few benches and a large green lawn. It's still a very pleasant place to sit and chill on a warm day."
There is so much space over there that it's still pleasant to take a walk around there while respecting social distancing. The city has done quite a lot of work renovating that area. It's quite refreshing.
"Usually it is a nice spot close to the old port but there is some work around it at the moment, so it is not so pleasant to be around."
Clean andwell maintained
Nice relaxing place to chill
We had a wonderful surprise opportunity while walking through at night with the video projection on the surrounding buildings. An incredible art display and the video was so well done. Check it out!
Nothing special. Just an grass field with memory on some past times. N8ce to sew but nothing to memorize.
Nice place.
"Park isn't much more than a large grassy area, but there is beautiful, historical architecture surrounding it."
"good place to hang around for a a quick rest, they  project  some great  short movies on the walls which looks so cool"
Nice place they are doing renovations. And looks better
"Very nice expanse of green and large levelled  area encircled by tall  buildings and old architectural structures in old Montreal. The place is maintained nicely and in the evening projection is made on to the tallest building which is nice to watch. You can have good view of the city landscape from here and especially during night the view is fantastic. The place is well connected by the subway at a walking distance.
So go there and relax a bit and enjoy the greenery and view around."
Very clean park located on the edge of Old Montreal. I looked at the large paintings of the city-memory event. It is a 45-minute projection on the history of Montreal starting every hour when darkness sets in. It is a memorable experience.
"Nice place, so impressed with architecture"
Great place to go with family and friends!
"An old military parade ground, part of the remenant of the early Ville Marie settlement."
I like and love this place of eastern Canada part. One can enjoy french colony
Nice audio visual show in the summer
"Old port Montreal, is a popular destination for tourists and also the locals. Near you can see great architecture, restaurants, landmarks and lots of activities all year long. Summertime you can enjoy the view, take pictures, videos and selfies. The best time to go for pictures are sunrise and sunset. The fireworks competition happens near Champ-de-Mars. This location is great for the whole family."
"If you want to know the city, you really need to come to this place ASAP! Here I learned about the history of the city and I can see the beauty of art everywhere.¬†Spending an afternoon walking the streets of olf Montreal is by far the most relaxing and cultural way of discovering the buildings and the history of this lovely town."
Really pretty and close to a subway station. Looking forward to going back as they project history videos on the building at night in collaboration with a Montreal History app. This is just one of a bunch of places that they project onto the buildings at night. Unfortunately we were unable to stay late enough to see it.
Beautiful place. Must go during summer. You can have a wonderful lazy evening with your friends and family.
"Nice place to sit, relax and people watch."
Cool shopping experience in a beautiful European like city.
"This is a very nice clean subway, on the orange line. The walk from old Montreal is great with some nice skyscapes as you walk down steps. A good alternative to Place d' Armes especially during the times when it feels rough  during the evenings."
"Nice park for a sunny day but a bit sparse, Right next to the often busy Old Port. Historic buildings and architecture to match, I strongly recommend a visit before Montreal overhauls this area. Oh, also bring change if you enjoy street music."
beautiful place at night. good to show to visitors to the city
Beautiful place! A beautiful view on the buildings!
"Love the City, this place was very ubique and historique"
Nice place and the show in the evening is worth watching. Nice sound and video.
"Beautiful, they had the history of Montreal playing when I visited on 05/2019"
"A real keeper in the city center. Surrounded by history and Montreal City Hall on its border, it is a great green space with awesome views of the city skyline. Close to the metro and a great place to take a break in the summer."
Small rooms. Very old and worn. Dirty bed. Front desk lady was very nice. restaurant nice. Area nice.
"Great views, keep walking around and look"
Awesome experience
Pretty but often under construction
It's one Metro station of Montr√©al. From here we can go to old port of Montr√©al.
They have made this park amazing. You get an amazing view of downtown Montreal. At night they have projections on the Palais de Justice.
Fantastic video instaltion showing the history of Montreal. Definitely worth the night time visit!
Public structure that was very grand and well kept. Good place to start your tour of the port area.
For the cite memouri on the wall of this building make my night a different night
It's the essence of Montreal...old port
Lovely place. Not much to see but nice for a walk
"Open space, lots of historical significance but at the time I visited this, I didn't realize how much history had happened here. Signage could be better."
Always go here because I have to but it's beautiful here in summer
"Really nice place to hang around; lots of restaurants, street artists and sight!"
"Nice place to just stop, sit and catch your breath when in the area"
great place to spend a summer day
Easy to spot while walking down Old Montreal. Really pretty architecture
Nice place to roam around or spend some time to roam! Place where you can find street shows sometimes!
"Great piece of history, glad to see a little bit of it had been preserved."
Lots of construction around.  Not very attractive in the winter.  Much nicer in the summer.
Historical Monuments all around and very close to Old Montreal Port.
The group loved the place.
"Central location in Old Montreal, nestled between the City Hall (H√¥tel de Ville) building and the ramparts that served as protection for the installations back in the 18th century onwards, it's a locus that grants access to the Place Vauquelin and the Palais de Justice to the west, and the Courthouse and Champ de Mars metro station to the east.

Cyclists will love it too because it is one of four locations in Montreal equipped with a red bike repair station. It offers a manual tire pump, rack, and bike-friendly tools like Allen keys, wrenches, and screw drivers."
Great quiet green space in the city.
Good place where people can take rest or enjoy exhibitions
Closest metro to Old Port. Very convenient.
It's getting better but it's still kinda dirty compared to other metro's
I go robbed and two kifes were pulled at me just about less than 30meters from camp de mars.I had to given all my wallet to the two homless guys because i was fear of my life.and than after they left me i run to the hotel and asked the fron desk if i can use the phone to call 911 and I had to explained to him why after that i was shocked when the person who works in fron desk refused to use the hotel phone .i went out and asked one of the people to use her phone to call 911 after i explained to her why..later on the canadian police arrested the two suspect and they told me that your hotel you stays in should have warned you not to walk here because alots of crime happening here every day .I will never book with this hotel anymore its not safe .also the staff was rude and careless about my own safty.unsafe location.rude staff
:D

"Beaucoup de place pour s'asseoir, on regrettera juste les travaux et l'incessant bruit des voitures."
"Nice park with lots of benches and tables to sit and eat. Play parks for kids, skate park and a dog park as well. Lot of trees for shade. Not much grass sitting space though."
Nice and vibrant park with playgrounds for the kids and the dogs. Lots of bench and tables too.
First time there but I had a great time with my 11 years old son.  Many park games for kids and adults.  Nice and huge trees for shade on hot sunny days.  We want to go back to discover more.
"Not too big or too small for a parc. It's just perfect plus it's near a school, your kids could go there."
"A great park for young families.
It features 2 large structures with slides and climbing walls for different ages. Multiple swings and a parent-baby swing too. There is also a storage space that contains rackets and balls that can be borrowed.

There is also a large water park.

This is beside a basketball court and a dog park."
"This is a great dog park.  There's lots of space to play with my dog.   The fences are very high.  There are several benches and picnic tables to sit at

Beware - in wet weather, the park gets extremely muddy."
"Great park and splash pad. Could use a little more shade, but that certainly isn't a deal breaker."
This is a good park for young family.
My daughter loves this park.

"This park is fantastic its fenced in the whole way around,so less worries for moms and dads for the running around type of child.Thete are picnic tables and benches too so the moms and dads can chit chat .But to be honest the best thing about the park is that the people who go there share its quite nice."

Good playground
Beautiful park but because of renovations on the small house/plumbing there isn't any water in two of the parks man made small pools...
Beautiful and charming. It's very quiet. Perfect for a calm walk.
"A cozy, calm and beautiful neighborhood. It's a perfect spot in all seasons for walking in and around. There are 2 lakes where docks hang out all summer until late October."
Most beautiful parc to have a picnic with your family/friends/date
"Beautiful park with so many nooks and crannies for kids to explore. You feel like you're in a forest with ponds, bridges, trees, and places to hide."

Very clean park. With small water falls and a small bridge across. It has an ice rink during winter where the artificial pond is during summer. Perfect for a quite walk.
A nice place to get some good exercise and just being calm.
"Pratt Park is a very pretty park that also acts as a square for the neighborhood around it. As part of a personal effort to get to know the green spaces of Montreal, I took the time to discover it and to walk around and take pictures of some of the gorgeous single houses that surround it. If I ever want to buy a house in Montreal, this location would be one that I would consider seriously. If you happen to be thinking along the same lines, take the time to explore the park and the houses around it on foot. You won't regret it."
This isnt as nice as the saint viateur bagel park nearby but also had mini river so that‚Äôs good.
Pretty nice place to eat lunch while watching cute ducks
Ice skating in Winter is great
Good place to walk around.
One of Outremont's best small parks with great water features that make good use of the incline for little ponds and streams. Remember them fondly as a child spending time following the water down from the top to the pond at the bottom. Often used for wedding pictures.
Fun and best place for walks
"Peaceful park, nothing too outstanding"
"Lovely little park, quiet, clean. The lake usually has ducks and there are other forms of wildlife around, very nice for a walk with your kid, plenty to discover."
Nice park
I love it because it is so nice to sit in the sun and it is  quiet just the sound of water and                      to see the different birds in the lake.
"Ducks and squirrels watching on the water
Beautiful landscape to enjoy sunsets and do picnics."
"Like a mini Central Park with ponds, bridges, waterfalls, ducks & squirrels! Feels like a forest within a city. Perfect place to fight Dragons with your Magic Sword +1 and rescue Princesses from the clutch of Evil Wizards  !  :)"
"good place for a quiet pic-nic on most occasions, all things considering"
It's a nice spot. The key attraction is water and ducks swimming in the wading pond.
"It is very pleasant when the sun is out very relaxing and enjoyable. Great Park, clean"
A very beautiful park. Quiet and clean. The pond becomes a skating/hockey rink in the winter.
"Lovely small quiet park on a slope between avenue Lajoie and Van Horne. It has a small pond in the upper part with water running down to a larger pond near Van Horne. Well covered by trees but it is possible to find places in the sun. It is very quiet, except in the lower part near Van Horne."
A simple yet rewarding oasis of a park for leisure strolls with kids or pets. Good pond action with ducks and geese.
"Cute little park. Don't be fooled by google map, there's no body of water, at least at this time of the year."
Nice green quiet park with beautiful ponds.
"Small pretty park with as stream and a small lake, very calming"

Well maintained and clean but too small for an energetic 5 year old.
Cute park.
Small with few games but fun for babies and kids under 5-6. The ground is soft and theres outdoor showers in the summer.
Fun place to watch your kids play.
Nice park for the kidsfrom 2 to 5y. There is a waterzone for the little ones also.
Good park
"Pro tip: Waterpark for children will keep operating long after all the children have gone to bed. Pack a lunch and a towel and hit that silver button, son!"
Such a popular space with a tiny surface
Fine place.
"Great place for dogs and humans to relax, work out, picnic, or play p√©tanque. The park has been recently renovated and it's well maintained. There are regular yoga classes provided by the city during the summer time as well. This is a lovely little urban oasis."
Great little dog park by day and crusing by night. Its to bad it was closed all summer for renovations. Looking forward to see what they do.
Clean. Colorful. Active.

New park
Park is clean and well maintained. Sprinkler system is on.
This park is good for playing sports.
"A nice park with good spaces for picnic. Also, it has available parking spots on the nearby streets. The playgrounds are suitable for children. Also, the sport fields are very useful for kids and youth in the community. The large lights are very good for people who like to walk in the park during the night. The park also has an outdoor swimming pool which will provide entertainment for everyone. I enjoyed walking around this park and recommend it to the people living nearby."
Ouellette Park is part of Lasalle history they kinda need some reno done but awesome park for the kids

Small park. No parking except on the street.
Great park to bring your kids anytime but more so when it's hot because of the water games. It's well fenced and quite big do I always feel safe letting the kids run around.
They are not enough stuff for kids in the park and the sprinklers are not up to date

Une belle place pour se d√©tendre.
"Having gone there a few years back, I thought it was worthy of a positive comment even though there was nothing extraordinary about reaching the Eastern point of the island.  If you happen to be in the area, I do recommend a small pit stop."
Tip of Montreal island. Fresh air and river overview from 3 side . Good place for family gathering and small BBQ
"Would be nice if there was a water fountain. There was a porta-potty, but no permanent toilets."

Good park. Some pieces were broken or close to breaking. My 5 yr old had a blast.
Great park for kids
Nice spot to chill.
"Nice and shady, bushy green grass which is rare. Lots of squirrels and birds. The only reason I took off a star is because of the dog poop not picked up."
Cool place to take a walk
Great for BBQs.
Very small with trails that are not maintained. But nice view of water and the 2 mountains railroad bridge. Also has view to new REM bridge being built. Lots of swamp area so be prepared for mosquitos when wet. Takes about 15 minutes to do the tour of trails.
Great place to walk dog and access to great water views.

"Riviere-des-Prairies and Pointe-aux-Trembles are lucky to have several parks that cater to a mostly local clientele. These two communities are situated at the far northeast corner of Montreal, which suffers from a lack of adequate public transportation. If you happen to live there or visiting friends or family, or if you have a car and don't mind driving the distance, make an effort to visit Parc du Moulin-du-Rapide. It is one of the larger and prettier ones in this area. It also has some fantastic views on the river that gave its name to this area (Riviere-des-Prairies)."
Nice place but quite dirty.
Its liit
Peaceful place
"The park is along Gouin Blvd. It is part of the established bicycle route, coming from the east side before going into Bois De Lissee Nature Park.
Being most important, this park have washroom and fountain, for your need.
The park is clean and quiet, have two playgrounds for children, benches and a single tennis court.
For those who want to have a look of the river, should go into Bois De Lissee from the direction of Maison Ruisseau. There is a lookout into the river. You can see Cat Island.
For those who like to have one full days fun, check my Hike and Bike list for recommendation."
Peaceful place to take a break
Great casual park for children to get out for a while.
Calm place &  you play tennis too ...
"Nice quiet park , great for kids"

"Free sliding, family environment rosting marshmallows and drinking hot chocolate around the fire."
So fun!!! Come in winter
Locke snow mountain for sleds in the winter
Great place to because of the good size hill that can be used in summer spring winter and fall.my rating is actually 3 and a half  stars.The parking lot could use some maintenance as far as more gravel to prevent holes in the lot with big muddy puddles during rain ect.
Nice green space.
"Great setup for families. Need more publicity on what is available & when. Limited hours for toddlers, but still great place to drop in during the winter"
"Much improved with the benches, little shacks, washrooms , and even a snack shack!"
Love skating there at night its butifull
"This place is fun. There is a skate park to play around,  there is 2 basketball courts to play some basketball. There is also a volley ball area to play volleyball and there is more. I come here all the time."

Nice ball field no night lights.  300 feet fence with net.
"Awesome place to slide in the winter!

Locked and mostly unused soccerfield in the summer... quite a letdown."
Nice green space with a skate park and a basball diamond
It has great variety and scenery. I was disappointed the soccer field was chained off. What's the purpose of that?
It was clean. What else can you say about a park. Unless it's a mess really.
Lots of snow!
"Lack of light on the beach volleyball courts, lack of sand of the beach courts (you hit the foundation through the sand in some places). But great place overall!"
Beautiful small park.
Huge sledding hill in the winter. Basketball court in the summer. Utilities close by.
"Small park with toboggan hill, baseball diamond, basketball  court and beach volleyball in summer.  Has a small skateboard ramp but lacks a rest room."
"Nice place, for kids and grownups"
A nightmare for when you want to go sliding unless you are walking distance go anywhere else
Pretty cool
Clean
Nice hangout place

"For motherhood, this is a five star park.
For safety of young children, the playground area is totally enclosed. Inside are face to face benches and  sandbox. At one corner, there is an interactive board too. The park highlighted the importance of social interaction, communication and security. Actually, park built with this traditional concept are hard to find now.
This little park is the one to help grow and develope the children in the right way."
It's a small but beautiful one
Nice
C'est  une belle place pour faire un pique-nique en famille
My friend got hurt

"How can I not love my local park? Survived a microblast a few years ago but rose from the dead. Cool skater culture complete with fumesü§™, kids cool off in sprinklers and play on playground equipment. Impromptu softball games, family gatherings, picnics with Gen Z's with cool tats, hair, and sexualities, and old white and Rastamen finally united by old age. Shakespeare in the summer, cross country skiing in winter."
It's very good place to play my young kids.
"I went to the dog park, which was very spacious. Also had a smaller dog park that can also be opened to the main one. It has chairs, large tree trunk for the adventurous dog to climb on. Many objects in the enclosure. It's not just a sandbox. More than one entrances which is great. Love this dog park. Very fun for the furry friends and their owners."
"Gorgeous park with plenty of grass space, benches and greenery. Also very clean! Great place to hang out."
The city of making many improvements to this park. The new chalet  Area is really nice. It's too bad that they lost all of trees in the storm.  Love the dog park.
"Very nice park. It seems to have recovered nicely from that storm that took down many of their big trees. It has a lovely monument for veteran, a dog park, a children's play area with splash pad. Two large grass areas for sports and skating in the winter. A general park space with lots of benches and even some exercise equipment. And free wi-fi."
"A tiny bit dirty. Very open, spacious, and loaded with many playgrounds."
"Take a walk, enjoy your moment and relax. It's a good place to do so."
"Awesome park so much space so much to do. Basketball courts, soccer field, table tennis"
Nice park with lots of opportunities for kids. Also has restrooms.
"One of my favourite parks, just not easy to walk in winter"
Great park for everybody plenty of place to sit
"It's a quiet place but also you can meet friends , friends with dogs as well ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Right in the heart of NDG is this beautiful little patch of green. It includes a children's park with water splashing, dog park, an skating area, baseball field and lots of grass to lay on. Washroom facilities are on site, and in winter they host a nice hockey skating rink.  Enjoy."
Cool park alot of open space
"Big, beautiful park. Lots of cafes and restaurants close by. Off-leash dog park, playground, exercise equipment, always people doing yoga and tai chi and having picnics. Baseball, buskers, free wifi, and public restrooms."
Great park. Was a beautiful day to take my dog to the dog park. Lots of very nice and friendly people. I live this park...
Green. Grass. Clean. Lovely people.
Great park great sledding in the winter! Dog run!
Beautiful park . Nice for grounding .
"Beautiful, clean and busy with families"
"Has all the fixings of a good park. It was recently renovated and they redid all the stone work after a storm destroyed some of the parks older trees. It has a dog park, and a kids park and a small place to skate. There are some benches and nice grassy areas."
"Lovely park even with the loss, to a stormy cloud burst, of the green cathedral of old trees along Sherbrooke."
"Dog run recently renovated - large, clean but a lot of sand so it's difficult for the dogs to run & play.
Overall a very clean & well maintained park with a newly renovated chalet with a large handicap accessible washroom."
Dogs love snow
Excellent park . My kids love the splash pad I enjoy  bringing  my dog üêï to the dog park
"Very nice park inside a busy city
This is a large park occupying a good sized block in a very busy section of Montreal.  There is enough room for a quiet oasis from to hectic pace around it, a dog run, two children's play grounds to cover all ages as well sports fields. It includes a small community building with washrooms.  Accessible by bus. There is some on-street parking."
"Beautiful park. Lots of space for kids. Waterpark . Lots of trees for shade.  Unfortunately the washrooms are closed due to covid19.  Still, a relaxing environment."
"A very good park, I used to go there everyday before pandemic"
"Great park with room to skate for those that like to skate board, splash park, lot of room to sit and relax with a good book or enjoy a pleasant conversation with a friend. Not to mention this park has wifi for those looking for free wifi access."
"Beautiful park!!  Big baseball field, they sometimes have movies in the park in the evenings. There is a water playground and a reasonably sized jungle gym with a sand bottom. There is a beautiful dog park renovated this year (2019). They also have have a water fountain for the dogs to drink from. LOTS OF ROOM TO LAY IN THE GRASS. ( Always look for mines before sitting ndg is VERY dog friendly"
The park is nice with internet access all over the area. Nice area to stretch your legs.
"Like all green spaces in Montreal, NDG park is well used and loved by its neighbours."
Nice park.
Cozy park along the main road of sherbrooke
Very nice park with great kids playground. I enjoy the dog park too. A must have in Montreal
"Notre Dame de Grace is a fine residential area, with some older brick houses, in streets canopied by beautiful large trees, and a few ""in"" streets for shopping and lounging in quaint cafes and authentic ethnic eateries.  A Montreal quarter with a unique character of its own. It also goes down to the part of Sherbrook street with its good stores, and restaurants.  Some of the restaurants and cafes have sidewalk seating too.  Parking might be hard to find at times.  Enjoy your visit!"
Great little park. Great area to walk your dog. There is space to let the dog run free. There is a space for children to play with bikes / skateboards. There is also lots of space to lay down a blanket and have a picnic or read a book. Good spot to enjoy the beautiful weather in the summer.
"Good for gathering  , walk and exercises easy to get there by public transit , velo or car"
Loved this place
"Puppy playground, toddler waddle area, and scampering squirrels...this park has everything for the haggard housewife."
"I had WiFi access from the Mtl open Internet network, great!.
Unfortunately, a group of pot smokers arrived and the smell was insupportable..."
"Nice park, many many activities, very good children area with fence"
Very nice park with playground and green space. Can bring kids here it have a picnic. Lots of restaurants around and easy to get here by public transportion. Recommend for visits in the summer when looking for a way to spend the afternoon. Highly recommend.
Nice place to chill and have a beer or 5.
"Nice playgrounds, one for small kids and one for bigger kids.  Chalet with toilet and indoors space really convenient.  Water park in summer and ice skating in winter.  Great park!"
"Nicely refurbished playground, mini water park for young children, newly planted trees to replace those lost during the storm. Cenotaph refurbished, very classy job! Dog run being redone summer 2019."
"A nice green spot taking the entire urban block between Girouard and Marcil, Sherbrooke and Cote-Saint-Antoine, is under a very heavy recreational pressure these days and worsening, but it used to be much more quiet. Too many people and dogs per square inch!"
There is a space for everyone. Even the furry ones.
Lots of room for activity and a lot of life
"Big park with lots of installation for toddlers, clean ,spacious, great place to have a piknik ."
Very nice place.
I LOVE this park! It's such a nice place to go with friends or family. The dog park is wonderful; I go there weekly with my labrador. There's also free wifi (yay!).
The place is very quiet and peaceful.We had a great time!
if you get there early enough it is very quiet.
Nice place to spend your time
Very clean and calm place!
Great place to relax.
An awesome park for the entire family. The splash park section for the children is excellent. The shear size of this space is a welcome green space in this concrete jungle.
My childhood park. The loss of the trees during a freak storm has been well dealt with. Nice place in the center of NDG.
beautiful park parts of it were decimated by the tornado we had a couple of years ago they have replanted replenished redone the dog run it's beautiful
Would love to have the chalet open on time every day as well as have the sand changed in the kids park. Been years since that happened. Otherwise a fun park for picnicking and playing with the family.
Nice attractive park un Summertime
Nice looking park. Not impressed at all by seeing young bums climbing all over the War Memorial as well as dealing with skate boarders farting around when they should be somewhere working and paying taxes like most of us. Where was security? Never ever saw one there patrolling at any time.
"Great park. Dog runs, softball field and lots of space and shade."
"Great park for grown-ups, children AND dogs. With Bixi stations during spring, summer and fall. It has a fenced dog area and a fenced children's area too. There a pleasant paths with a few remaining trees from last year's microburst that brought some down and it also has a softball field that has a skating rink installed during winter, the chalet hosts bathrooms and public common sheltered areas. This is a pretty nice Park!"
great place to have a rest. Quiet and good management
"This park is also full of big old trees spaced attractively, a dog park is fenced in and frequently visited where dog lovers and dogs can connect with old friends and new, a fine water park and picnic tables make for a lot of family fun in Summer. In Winter the ice skating is great fun for everyone, night and day.
The sloping ground from the main red brick chalet makes for a very pleasant vantage point to people- watch the pedestrians on Sherbrooke Street. So many come to the park with a blanket to sit and dream as the clouds pass over the tall trees. Squirrels love it too. As do dogs of various sizes as long as they are on a leash. Dogs can run free in the fenced in dog park.
Most importantly, the park is now home to The Vimy Ridge Monument as of 2017.
Where it is placed prominently at the mouth of the park facing Sherbrooke Street, it is called Place Vimy.

This park is where great memories are made."
I love to go for a walk with my whole class from Forward House!
Great neighborhood park.
Been going to this park all year round. Nice place to workout or sit and relax and reflect life.  Wish there were more workout installations.
"NDG Park is one of the better green spaces in NDG. It covers a large area and is great for people of all sorts - families, couples, groups, and individuals. If you need a quiet corner, it's easy to find and if you're looking for some socializing there are plenty of people just hanging out. Large trees, shade, well balanced with other large open areas. There's a kiddie area with plenty of swings etc. and a water playground for hot summer days. In the winter, there's an outdoor hockey rink that the city sets up.There also is an enclosed dog area that is large and dogs can roam free and play with other doggies. There's a subsection to keep the smaller dogs away from the big ones."
A beautiful park in NDG neighborhood.
Nice looking park perfect place for you to be with your friends and relax
"Love to feed the squirrels here. After the big storm, the park is not so nice without the large trees that were destroyed. But that's nature..."
They have a very nice and newly renovated dog park!
"Good place to chill or have some rest, very quiet and beautiful"
It's a nice small park right on Sherbrooke. Popular spot in the neighborhood.
"Love this park! Quite big, but i usually just hang near the doggies park. :) full of squirrels and a nice atmosphere"
Micro burst tree devastation
Nice and relatively clean
"Public park with free access, lots of space to walk, run, play, or relax. Has play area for younger children. Great location if can find street parking by meter."

"Our go-to spot (especially in summer) to picnic, sit out and read a book, enjoy a bit of greenery etc"
"I love our NDG park. It's always clean and well maintained, has great people and lots of events. The dogs love it too :)"
It is ok. not very big.
"Beautiful and very quiet place to relax, do some meditation, take the sun, read a book, walk your dog and even have picnic.
It has internet conection to work or just enjoy yourself"
Plenty of space for kids to play.
The splashpad is a great place to take the kids to cool off on a hot day. Play structures available for all age groups. Just a nice park to sit and have a picnic with friends. Washrooms are available as well.
Lots of greenspace; swings and play park for children; new trees - nicely manicured.
Lovely park.
This is a great place to chill out!
Lovely place where you can find self rest.
"Structures for big kids and small, sprinklers, and plenty of room for a picnic.  Bathrooms and water fountains. Dog run too."
"Newly renewed park, got free WiFi.. Never seen that before. Very nice area"
"Great ambiance and size! There is free Wi-Fi available for public use while in the park, as well as a lot of amenities. Skating rinks in the winter, soccer and baseball fields in the summer, lots of green space. There is even two dog parks (one for big dogs, and one for little), so even furry friends can have fun here!"
Great NDG park
"Since the storm destroyed so many trees in this park, the city has made huge improvements to it and it's chalet!  It's not quite finished but a fabulous transition!"
"Something for everyone! Splash pad, 2 playgrounds, a dog park, and wide open grassy space with old trees, perfect for picnics, exercise, meditation, walks, or a nap in the sun."
Very nice park hut it was better to have a swimming pool too.
Love the two kids' play areas and the dog park. Sprinkler park needs a better lock on the gate.
Small . Clean and neat . Needs a little love
Great park for all sorts of activities
"Pro: excellent park. Lots of good areas for small kids. [~2y]
Con: couldn't get the free wifi working"
"Nice open area
Big play area
Clean
Ppl r friendly"
Local park great for relaxing or dog walking and bringing the kids.
I like that there's running water available to keep the dogs hydrated. .. the lack of grass and complete dirt park  for the dogs makes for a messy park experience on wet days.
"Love the park and the fact that it has a dog run, although the dog run could use some inexpensive improvements."
Awsome place for picnics and a day out can spend hours here there is a church close by
Great park. Fun for kids. Great place for a picnic
Place looks great.. Even has a water park for young kids
Beautiful clean and many things to do

"Beautiful urban park with skating rink, baseball diamond, kids play area, dog run,  free WiFi."
"It is a beautiful and relaxing park with  a recently renovated dog park, a small water park and a playground for kids, which are now open. Sometimes atmosphere feels like Woodstock. Before the freak microbursting  windstorm of August 22nd, 2017, there were lots of old trees but they did do a nice job making the park beautiful again. Having a play in the park was a good idea, and has become a pleasant but distant memory of the old days. Considering many people in this neighborhood don't have backyards or balconies, going to a park is crucial for their well being, especially when so much has been stopped and may not restart as expected or promised. One thing missing in this park is an official skateboard area/rink so there is a lot of random skateboarding going on sometimes even on the cenotaph and obstructing the walking area around the cenotaph. Sometimes the distancing rules are not remembered and some boarders wiz by other park goers within inches so there is a potential for a future accident waiting to happen, IMO. You also have to keep an eye on the path when walking because, like most of Montreal there are a lot of  pot holes, skateboarders whizzing by and people who stand in the path talking to each other 6 feet apart  so you have to walk around them. Sometimes not much respect for social distancing and a small number of  frisbee throwers, not  wearing masks, tend to be inconsiderate of others sitting on benches, while apologizing every time they almost hit them with a possibly contaminated frisbee, sometimes crawling under the bench the person is sitting on to retrieve the possibly contaminated frisbee, so only safe option is to find another bench. Similar with taking a bus nearby. An unmasked person putting their hands on the back of your seat  gives you  no other safe option but to find another seat, cause someone saying that they are sorry while they are possibly spreading, instead of trying to prevent the spreading and the fear of spreading Covid-19 to possibly vulnerable people is not enough IMO & rather stupid if not hypocritical. We have gone through all this for 3 months, putting millions out of work & many businesses could go bankrupt, to prevent spread of Covid-19, so an umasked stranger can whimsically throw a possibly contaminated frisbee so another can  crawl under your bench to retrieve it. For a moment a beautiful park feels like a sad place to be."
"Plenty of stuff to do wether it's watching doggos üêï, playing frisbee or taking your kids out at the water park!"
A nice place for small children. Good splash park.
Good vibe generally with lots of possible activities. It also has a dog park.
Nice park . Lots of activities such as movie night etc during the summer

Home
Beaucoup des jouex
"Really nice park, except for one of the soccer fields that is now mostly sand."
Visit plz
Nice small park. Nothing special. It's calm but is attached to a school so during the day it's a little noisy but quiet in general...
Very nice little park. Need more garbage cans though. But really nice to sit and relax.
"Beautiful and friendly park. Like it a lot, visiting it very often"
Nice place for kids  and pets owners
Very good place to meet up and have some fun with your family and friends
Gilbert Layton is a great part. Built for soccer and bocce ball. The only reason I was there is to get my truck towed. So that day it wasn't too nice.
Very clean nice to hangouts abit
Needs a gog park...if you know what i mean
"Disappointed that this park does not have outdoor workout equipment which we've been seeing popping up throughout the city. These are great for elders and for parents to use while keeping an eye on their kids.

The park is cozy and clean, and the lawn bowling area is very interesting."
"Have been going here for years and while its not as fancy as some other parks it has served the community very well, its large enough for the kids to do their thing in short, the kids enjoy it and so do the parents. Recently wifi was installed at Gilbert-Layton and I think folks appreciate that."
Children love it
Much space for children and an excellent soccer field!
"they have dog police hiding in the bushes during summer months, $650 ticket per dog without a leash..."
Decent park. Clean and secure.
wish there was a dog run
Beautiful
Cool park loved it had fun

Lots of different options for children.
Great park.

Always filled with kids they deffenetly have fun there.
Beautiful and relaxing.
Very clean and beautiful park. I love spending time there with my friends and family.
Ok
Nice little park
Good place
Park is clean but small.
It has beautiful trees and lots of green space. Unfortunately the city does not clean this park often. And it needs more picnic tables.
"This park is very nice. It is surrounded by a library, school and community center. Also a rather unique feature it is shaped like an octagon, the street Francois-Perrault runs the entire perimeter, take a look at it in satellite view."
"Nice parc
Mama and papa love me and papa love him"
A beautiful park to spend time with family!
Has everything you could ask for in a park.
"Nice place to stay with kids but unfortunately there are more mischievous teenagers than usual. Saw some teens fighting each other a few times. Police, please do something in this parc."
"Nice parc to relaxe, very quiet!"
Nice park but the school across is quite loud and disruptive.
"Cultural mix every week
Very nice park"
every peaceful ...I love parcs
Small parc and too crowded
"Well I live nearby since 2012 and I must say that it has nothing to do with what i've heard in previous years. The City and some not-for-profit organizations have invested into making this parc a very family-friendly place. There's a refrigerated ice rink, lots of seating, a nice pool, soccer field and kid's playground. Some of my neighbors, who have been in the area for 50 years, told me that the place has evolved a lot since all of the investments in the park and it keeps getting better."
"It's an ok parc in Montr√©al, not the best but definitely not the worst either. It's a good option for the family. My girlfriend loves it"
"Lots of skating to be done, ice quality is usually nice although they should consider watering it overnight instead of cutting out 3 hours of skating time during the day"
The basketball court is lit until 11 that‚Äôs amazing
Great place for your family and friends
"Place where locals meet on ""weedkends"". To party n celebrate freedom"
Lovely safe clean park for all ages.
Tennis court was cement.
"It has so many things to do, a playground, a skating ring, a soccer field, a bastball court tables and chairs. Saint-Michel metro is close."
Its a nice place to be in the summer.
"Beautiful park. It really is the highlight of the neighborhood with its big outdoor pool, the library and the playgrounds."
One of the best parks in summer and winter.
too noisy
"Artificial ice rink sponsored by the Habs is a plus, but the tennis courts need a major make over....in really sad shape"
Family friendly!
Too crowded
Super
Nice little park.
Super
"Nice park, but sometimes overcrowded."
Small little Park for kids
"Near metro st -Michel, cars parking , soccer and basketball field,  children play place,  and a public pool."
Nice and calm.
Outdoor hockey.
C'le meilleur parc il y'a de tout surtout la piscine c'tred agr√©able de passer quelques heures la bas moi ca me relaxe √©norm√©ment
"Great place to swim! Staff looked organized and were friendly. Covid safety measures seemed to be well respected by both staff and patrons.

The pool was at a nice temperature to swim in even on a cloudy day. There were a few leaves in it at the bottom here and there, but it was still very clean, especially for the first day open of the season!"
"Parc Jean Drapeau is by far my favorite parc in Montr√©al so far. It‚Äôs a great location for families on a picnic day trip, for amateurs, semi pro and professional bikers, joggers, lovers, or for those who love photography especially flowers macro photography.

It‚Äôs a one parc on 2 islands system and the beauty of it is that one can escape the city and its noise, cars, humans, Covid, literally just by crossing the bridge.

A wonderful location to spend hours enjoying nature, birds singing,  color change of our rivers as a factor of skies reflection, trees, greens, and of course my favorite, macro photography.

The sight is even absolutely breathtaking in the fall when leaves colors go from green to red and everything in between the spectrum.

My extra special thank yous to the women and men who work on a daily basis keeping the parc as pretty as it is every day, and to the city for this wonderful treasure."
The park is beautiful. The serenity is wonderful if you want to escape the noise of the city. It's got a cool breeze from river saint lawrence. You can have a peaceful day out here.
"Fun place to visit, I prefer to get around on a bicycle. It's a pretty good big place to walk around.
You can bring picnic and enjoy the view.
You can visit early in the morning to avoid crowds, or at night to enjoy the illuminated areas."
"Many outdoor activities like Rock-climbing Kayaking Wildlife observation Outdoor pool  not sure if it is opened Hiking  25 km Cycling and Picnic area BBQ allowed as well as   metro station inside the park moreover the parking is paid 8$ per hour and 15$ full day time, there is 12 parking areas it is
jewel nestling in the St. Lawrence River, Parc Jean-Drapeau is without doubt one of Montreal most precious assets and a one-of-a-kind place in Canada.
Discover this amazing  urban park."
Always a beautiful place to visit. You can cycle around everywhere and enjoy the views.
Beautiful. Relaxing. Can't wait for more colors to bloom on the trees.
"Very nice, peaceful. Cool views, clean, toilets availables, picnic tables, parking. Worth the visit."

"Very big park where you can hike, do a picnic and even swim
You can go there by metro jean Drappeau station."
"Went for a picnic in park Jean Drapeau with some friends and had a great time. We made a barbecue and the weather, accommodation and accessibility were great. I highly recommend you visiting that park when you‚Äôre in the city and looking to do something fun"
We love spending our weekends in this park. It's the most beautiful park in Montreal.

"Really nice park, good for a walk, get some fresh air. It is accessible by metro. Usually there are a lot of festivals in the park all year long."
Nice park for biking. Many interesting spots beside de river :)
"Big and beautiful park where you can find bixi station, access to metro (yellow line), route vert and other attractions."
"If you are looking for some peace inside this big city, this is the place. This artificial island has great facilities for shows, sports and the like. There is also a casino in there! Easily accessed by metro, come, bring your foldable chair and relax just few minutes from the crowd."
"Very nice park to wander around. Lots of room to explore, and offers great views of the city skyline"
"Beautiful little haven in Montreal, lot's of little treasures to explore such as the botanical gardens, swimming pool, climbing wall, biodome, many biking paths, and a great view of the city."
"Very nice parc, especially to bike there!"
"Great city park on the rivers' edge where there is something for everyone. You can cycle on the  bicycle paths, or walk or hike, and in winter, you can snow shoe or cross country ski. There are many rest benches available, and there are restrooms and also paid parking lots."
Went for a swim and caught a cold but still worth it I love this parc
"Distant enough from city to avoid crowds, and vast enough to provide ample space for picnicking, cycling or just walking or jogging."
I go biking there from downtown and it‚Äôs really nice and quiet in the morning
Marvelous place to bicycle. Lots of opportunities for great photos as well.
So beautiful!! And so many exotic plants!

Today is the first time that I visit Parc Jean-Drapeau in the winter season. I love the snow in the park, it is so fresh so beautiful. The ice in the river is almost all melted. Yes, the spring is just around the corner !"
"Loved the park! There was a beautiful light show that night. And it was really nice to bike there, too."
"Boss place to chill, cycle and such likes great venue for Osheaga also"
"Parking is paid.
üò£üò£
Everything is fine except that...
üå∫ü¶ã"
Great if Piknic Eletronik was open
"Awsome place to visit with friends and family,walk into trees,beautiful flowers,roads, and  locations"
Beautiful park. Home of many fun festivals.
The best place in Montreal to take a relax all day
"Wonderful  place to take a ride with bicycle,  amazing views to downtown  of Montreal  and old port"
"Huge park, lots of trails, clean. Pre-pandemic there was an event minimum once a week."
Was there with my family for walk and picnic
"Despite all good things,The parking fair is a little bit pricy"
Magnificent parc tucked away from the bustle of the city with amazing views and architecture.  Bixi bike rental is available on site now. Had a magical evening watching sunset colors.
Nice place. Could be more cleaner.
Nice place with a nice view to Montr√©al but no playground for kids
"Very nice place for picnics, cycling and skating especially with kids!"
"Lots of parkings, fair timing dor the pool access"
It is a must to go in 2021 but it's a shame that several activities are not fonctional due to sanitary measures.
"I love this place, bike, formula 1, beach, concert, six flags.  In one word, adrenaline world"
"Visited the place this summer! Very vast safe place, not too crowded, easy social distancing. My visit to the park was the best day of 2020! Stay safe!"
"A great park to bike around and relax crack a couple of beers in the sun! Always events going down, they have a lot of parks and sights to see. Along with a swimming pool and the F1 track. It‚Äôs only getting 4 because there is always road work going on! But welcome to Montreal."
Very nice place for a peaceful walk or bike ride.
"Beautiful nature and great place for photographers.

Enough place for beginner drivers to drive üöó"
Enjoy the quiet nature
"Very pleasant view, wanna go again with friends"
Its a nice place to enjoy by bike or footing
Nice place to picnic. Good views of the river and the city.
"This island is AWESOME for everything, you can hike there, you can go to the theme park and much more."
"Site of the Montreal Expo 67, now it is home to the F1 Google Villeneuve Circuit, La Ronde (Amusement Park), the casino and a lot of festivals, such as Osheaga,  Pinik Electronik, Montreal 77, Metal Montreal, Ile Soniq. The US pavilion is still present, which is now a water museum. It is always nice to go there and see one of the best view of Montreal from the other side of the river."
Beautiful park with metro access
Great park to spend time with family
"Nice place for biking or walking. you have some areas if you want to relax or picnic, and I think you can find restrooms also."
The two parks are islands so many space to do your family activity for the whole day
The place is nice to visit in the evening. Prepare well for cold before visiting.
It's so beautiful and peaceful place. Sit on the river bank and listen to the sound of running water.
A beautiful park. There is a bathroom under the bridge. Great place for a wedding. I really enjoyed walking through here
I was there for Heavy MTL in 2010. What a show and what a time. I got so lucky to snap this pic of Rob Zombie as he made his way into stage!!!
I visited this park in pandemic and still was amazing!
You can have a lot of fun there. Beautiful place!
Amazing park and concert venue. Sllllaaaaayyyyeeeerrrrr
"I love this island, and the connecting one Notre Dame island where the circuit is. The man who owns a little pop up cafe there is very helpful and makes excellent coffee. The islands have wonderful greenery and hidden gems, it really transports you to a completely different world. Close to the city and very accesible!"
Simply beautiful and calm. ( winter period)
Very nice and quiet park with awesome views of the Old Port and Jaques Cartier bridge
"This island in the middle of the St. Lawrence ist both a recreational and a sports site. They were hosting the Olympics 1976, the Formula 1 and several Swimming World Championships."
Beautiful place to ride your bike.
"Every Sunday during summer, the parc hosts an Electronic picnic (Picnic Electronik) which showcase djs both local and around the world. Plenty of food trucks, alcohol vending and bathrooms around this vast, two stage area. Enormous dance space, under the sun beautiful location downtown with views of the city across the St Lawrence River. Starts at 2pm ends at 9.30pm, awesome people with scantily clad women everywhere. Techno music and eye candy fest rolled in one. Great way to spend a Sunday. Accessible by Longueuil (yellow line) metro, ATMs on location but pricey. Tickets can be purchased on site, food allowed on premises,  but not personal alcohol. Beer/Wine/Hard alcohol sold on premises."
"A must-go park in Montreal! They have special cultural events all year round. We just went to the Chinese Lantern Show October 2019, and it was fantastic!"
I love the cycling on the race track. It‚Äôs the best road cycling I‚Äôve ever experienced. It‚Äôs great for training for competition.
"Not very walkable at night, and pretty empty. A lot of construction going on too by the looks of it. Probably much better off going in the day."
Like the new installation. We went for Saint Jean and it was nice
Love  itüíö
One of the best views of the Montreal city.
"We had such a great time at Parc Jean Drapeau.
It's so easy to get there because it's next to the metro station. Literally by its side.

Also everything is so organized. Food ""court"" had a little band playing for us while we ate and I was really impressed by how fun can it be a day in the park.

High point was the hanger with all lost items. Genious and shows honesty of people."
We were there for fete des neiges. A lot of family activities but still fun for a group of early 30s.
Very nice place to visit with family and friends
"If you are a tourist, you will not miss it if you are not coming. This place good for the locals who wants foo get away from city life."
Great for a bike ride or a picnic.
Me and my friend tried on this island at night time to our wonder none were there it feels like it‚Äôs deserted and we are just stranded on an island covered with lights but it‚Äôs very beautiful view of skyline and always loved it ....
"I have visited this park several times. The biosphere is a great place for kids of all ages. This is also the site for Heavy Montreal, an outdoor heavy metal festival which is great fun! The site is very well maintained with more than adequate amenities."
Amazing place for concerts. Only suggestion I'd have is for more water filling stations for summer concert festivals
Attractive view at night time
"amazing place, beautiful park, must-see"
This park is amazing!  Was here for a music festival and had a lovely time!
"The Park is huge and looks pretty, but there‚Äôs nothing open right now and nothing to do. No restaurant/Cafe. The casino is open, but it‚Äôs terrible. It would be cool to ride a bike around."
Perfect place to do sports
"Everything is amazing. Better to go and experience yourself. I have been in this many times but I never feel the same excitement. In every visit, I get new freshness, new excitement and new energy. If you wanna see the waves on the river and wanna write something or create any new ideas, it‚Äôs the perfect location. If you wanna do hiking inside the forest, it‚Äôs there. If you wanna visit artificial trees and parks, it‚Äôs there. In my opinion it‚Äôs a complete parc attached with every kinds of human feelings."
"Massive and beautiful park. It's the home to many of montreal grand festivals. La ronde is just meters away, and montreal  beautiful Biosphere is at the heart of the park. Very clean, and well maintained. Easy access from downtown using the subway. The parking and traffic could become a nightmare during summer time, especially during MTL formula one or L'International des Feux Loto-Qu√©bec"
"It's so beautiful, conveniently accessible and perfect for family, kids and biking."
Beautiful place and not crowded
Love it. Nature is beautiful
Breathtaking
I loved it.
"Beautiful park, lots of amenities. Definitely spend a day here. There‚Äôs even a beach! No swimming though."
"Best for festivals, biking and chilling"
üíï
great place to do acid
Nice park
It is always magnific during summer or winter.The sunset is always amazing
"Lovely little island where you can find a nice attraction of nature, festivals going on winter and summer... easy access by metro"
Fun to visit with family
"Went there for heavy Montreal, it was surreal"
Great place to relax and click amazing pictures.
"If you are with your family or kids, you may like it! Went for la f√™te des neiges and there was a lot of free stuff to do! Otherwise for adult ... Well I hope you like food :-)"
Best place in montreal
"So may mosquitoes, poorly maintained."
"So many places to expore, enjoy and spend a whole day
Swimming, museums, lookout, events
Although wish they have some good coffee shops :)"
"Lovely place, clean and very safe. Nice day out with the family and free as well"
"We really enjoyed our free Sunday Bixi Bike ride here! We arrived over one bridge and left on a another and visited the whole island, riding or walking. There are a lot of paths for both. There is art and a cute museum and the Biosphere which has a good exhibit outside even if you decide not to go into the main museum. Really pretty spot to hang out around the fountain/pool outside when it's sunny. A great view of the city from the island also. There is an amusement park if that's your thing as well. We had a lovely day and I recommend doing this either as a local or tourist."
"I thought the park was fabulous at first.... BUT there are no bikes for rent!! Plus there is no signage to indicate where to walk for the bridge over the Habitat 67. And there are huge barricades to walk back around if you happen to go the wrong direction, easily adding 1km+ to your adventure. It does have a lot of information surrounding the biosphere on environmental challenges facing Canadian ecosystems which is important and in good repair."
A nice place to have a walk.
Very nice and scenic.
Feux follet √©vent: we will never go again. They have like ex: 3000 parking spot but they have over 6000 cars coming in. No parking space mass traffic and nothing special. You really rather go to see lanterns event at the Jardin Botanique. First you go in and u can already the entire area. Second there is not parking. And last they have so few shows included and it‚Äôs over crowded your barely see anything.
"Great park for families, teens, and kids. Needs at least a whole day to fully explore and experience. The best attractions in my opinion are those that successfully combine nature(outdoors) and modern fun, and this one more that fits the bill. It even has a water park, a theme park, a cultural site and my favourite part a climbing wall that falls directly into a pool (no harness/ ropes)!!!"
Nice place for walking and city views
Go with family for Picnic
The park is huge with great space to run and to explore activities.
Very nice park. The Beach front is particularly nice. I went for Pokemon Go Safari zone event. Lots of people crowding the path. On any other day I bet you could do all kinds of other activities here.
Touristic place!
"Wonderful place to either have a walk, picnic or to get in one some of the views of downtown Montreal."
"Quiet and green oasis in bustling Montreal. Easily accessible by metro; the station brings you inside the park. There's also a viewing tower inside, which is shut at the moment for renovations (May 2019). Musical events are held there in spring and summer, which may prohibit general public access to all areas of the park. There's also a swimming pool in the park. Loos available."
Great park
Very nice üëå
"There is a festival of snow going on. Kids must enjoy it so much. Adults would take a trip to go to the casino. Also a lot of food truck, Tim honton, poutine, pull pork sandwich etc... Live music as well. Just pretty great activity on the weekend"
We loved the fet√™s des niege! My kids had so much fun we forgot it was freezing out lol they have food trucks and food areas to eat you can bring your on food saw ppl doing that they have places for hot drinks and a bunch of free activities the kids did the tra√Æneau √† chiens and they loved it!
"This place is amazing for festivals.

I went to Heavy MTL and Osheaga this year and the accessibility of the site (parc Jean Drapeau) is among the best I've seen for festivals :
There is literally a metro station right at the entrance of the parc (yellow line)"
"Really amazing place! Nice Park with trees, flowers, small lakes. Also there is a river where you can enjoy the view to the city. You can climb to the high bridge, enjoy the view to the city and river and go to another side of the bridge, which is already a city. üôÇ"
"Great place to visit. It is always a beautiful feeling to go by when the technical teams prepare big events. I was touring this island on my bike. Construction workers were building an impressive infrastructure for the international FORMULA 1 event in The beautiful city of Montreal, QC. I was very much impressed how they set up great attention to the security of the spectators and cars. I am looking forward to attend. I have bought my ticket. After i visited the tulips in the gorgeous gardens around the Casino. You must absolutely visit. Next event is the huge Rave Party Osheaga! My friends are coming to attend with me from Germany and Japan. They want to surprise me with their costumes. I am impatient."
"we always go to fete des neige and the kids have a great time.nice activities ,good entertaiment , you can bring your lunch or go to food trucks .there's a  heated pic nic area . It's a wonderfull  way to spend the day outside for free and have plenty of fun .you can also buy the accropass that allows a few more activities."
"F√™te des Neiges is great at Park Jean-Drapeau. Many things to do for kids. However, the parking is overpriced. 20 dollars is way too expensive."
Good place for family fun.  Would have been better if everyone was allowed to enter rides area without the tickets.  This way people can choose to pay the rides that they want. Rest of the family group can go to the restaurants or do other activities and pay accordingly.  Savings for families and more revenue for other vandors.
Beutiful park with lot of thing to discover
"This park is amazing. For running, bicycling or anyother thing. The park is located in the middle of water and you get there with a big bridge. It's really green and full of small waters and beautiful sides."
Excellent but it need a little bit mantenim
Amazing park with lovely view and lots of activity all years round. Available parking and perfect place for kids and parents to share the joy. If you need to do nothing just go there and stare in the water to feel the paradise on earth :)
"Very large park. I was there for the ilesoniq electronic music festival, but the grounds were well laid out and clean despite the people leaving their garbage on the ground. Thank you to the people who pick up other people's garbage and the people who pick up their own."
"Beautiful cityscape view. Great view of Jacques Cartier bridge, the Biosph√®re and more. Would recommend going there at night when the colorful lights are on."
"This park is my favourite place in montreal. It has everything from great views of the city, easy access by metro or car, lots of attractions, and best of all it's great for wildlife photography (I'll explain below)

On my visit to Montreal I can here four times and out of the four times I saw a red fox 3 times. They are very easy to find and I did not have to go looking for them or walk very far from the metro to find them. They are very friendly and some will come up to you for food(do not feed or pet them just back away) and will stay still enough around you for you to take some amazing pictures."
"nice place, early spring you have wild flowers, some fishing to be had around the island but its difficult, lots of strong currents"
Beautiful!
I call it the island festivals on summer lol it is the Ibiza of Montreal ... piknik electronik is a must
"Calm, beautiful"
Amazing place to spend your time!
"Really nice place for walking, hang around and relax. Also it has the Biosphere and Stewart museum."
We rode lime electric scooters around the island and it was amazing! Highly recommended.
"Great place ""a plein air "" in Montreal. A must visit place for tourists. A lot of cultural events take place here. I recommend Les  Festivals du Monde and the  Hocheaga music festival."
Came for Heavy MTL in 2019 and had a great time!
Really cool park. Close to the water and quite a few nice landscape. Very nice picture to take at sunset with the Montr√©al downtown skyline. I recommend it
Big beautiful park. Very scenic and nice for a picnic.
Beautiful park! Though the parking is a bit of a problem when you are trying to exit and activities are going on in it. Love the view to downtown Montreal!
"This was a large park located on an island just a short way from the mainland of Montreal, on the St. Lawrence River.

I took the subway (yellow line) there from downtown and visited for about an hour. There were some pretty walking trails through the woods which were peaceful and lovely to explore and lots of green spaces to picnic or relax. I also enjoyed taking photos of the Biosphere. The island also had an outdoor swimming pool, beach and La Ronde Amusement Park.

There was some major construction going on during my visit, so some areas looked pretty messy, but I am sure it will look much better in the future."
"Nice park, a lot of fun to go there, the only problem is the traffic and parking"
Always good times and fun activities happening here in the summer time.
Cool
Was here from New York for a pokemon go event that was going on. Such a beautiful place would definitely go back especially for the lantern festival that had as we were leaving
Wonderful place
We rented a Bixi bike here and rode around the island. It was so much fun
amazing place lots of things to do. a lot of people there.
"There is one attraction in Parc Jean-Drapeau that surpasses all others; The International Fireworks competition. It is spectacular beyond words, so I'll end this here."
Fun to walk around !
Beautiful.
Very nice place üòÅ
Great outdoor venue that blends nature and the iconic Montreal skyline all into one fantastic place. A must visit when in town!
"Parc Jean Drapeau is a good place for family, couple or friends activities. There‚Äôs an amazing variety of options to do like music festivals, outdoor sports, musculation (there‚Äôs some material around the park), swimming and more."
"I wouldn't recommend going right now. The whole place is under construction, amusement park seemingly closed, no open footpaths, biosphere also under construction it looks like. Maybe in summer it would be more pleasant to visit but I had a disappointing time and couldn't wait to get off the island."
"Hiking in here was so peaceful during winter time, great views of the City"
Nice place to visit when you're new in montreal i recommmend
Awesome
"I always make it a point to come here everytime I visit Montreal. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, and see it from a comfortable distance. Being the site of the World Expo in 1967, you'll see remnants of that event as you walk around, including Alexander Calder's towering art installation called ""Trois disques"" and the Biospehere geodesic dome. The park is served by a metro station (yellow line), convenient for those reliant on public transportation to move around the city.

For our most recent trip, we skipped the top attractions and just did some light hiking. From the metro station, we headed toward the ""Trois disques"" and enjoyed the scenic views of downtown Montreal. From there, we followed a tree-covered walk path toward the southern tip of the island, and then made our way back to the metro station. 1.5 hours in total.

We were tempted to rent those Bixi bikes near the metro station and bike it to downtown, but the fierce winds deterred us. There aren't a lot of food places around here so be sure to bring some with you if you're planning to be here for a few hours."
Amazing place can't wait to go back. Went for Osheaga but will return to the park again for sure!
"It's a really nice place hampered by awful traffic in and out. I really think cars should be banned and only public transit shuttles should be allowed, it's got a Metro station and it should be leveraged."
"The best Pokeboule. Very fresh and good ingredients. Tasteful, nice and perfect!"
"This lush green island flanks the south-eastern shore of Montreal island and provides access to the circuit Gilles Villeneuve (formula 1 race track) and a variety of bucolic outdoor open spaces where you can take a break from the summer heat of the city. Bring a picnic and get there by bicycle or public transport to avoid parking fee. Beautiful waterways and open spaces also lead to a variety of open-air exhibits as well as the Biodome and an Acquatic complex, which features three exterior swimming pools. The annual international fireworks competitions are held here, as are a number of live concerts. Sunday afternoons during the summer feature DJs who spin international electronic music at ""Picnic electronique"", which provides a real groove for the end of your summer weekends."
Biosphere and Stewart Museum are two places worth visiting. The swimming pool is very crowed in summer.
"A beautiful well maintained park with lots of interesting thing to see and do. Running, biking, canoeing, swimming to mention some"
Went here for Osheaga the park grounds were absolutely stunning and the view from across the water is breathtaking loved the park
"We visited in the off-season with very little activity, having come specifically to see the Biosphere, but still had a pleasant time wandering through the park. There are lovely views of the island from across the water."
"Beautiful park, went for Ilsoniq music festival, would go back on a normal day for the sights"
"Amazing location and superb connectivity through metro.  The place is quite nice for small hikes, picnics, biking around and many more activities."
Nice little park to explore. Home of the Klntreal Olympics
"Well.... at first I got conned.  By someone on facebook who was selling me tickets illegally and I didn't catch on until too late.  So that was a super bummer.

Then,  I found a legit person, referred to me, who sells tickets for a living... then I finally got the wristbands and all the required paperwork.

I'm glad that music festival organisers make it difficult to get these tickets otherwise everyone would be ripped off continuously and without reservation.

The problem left is getting the monies over to the actual artists that are performing instead of all the organizers and music labels getting Most if not almost ALL the money from record, song, festival, and streaming sales.  It is QUITE the racket... the music industry.   And I am very sad for the musicians, who are the ones who lose out.

Only went one day, Sunday and saw the Fontaines D.C. (who were AMAZING...and I believe they will become HUGE).  Then Monolink, DJ Kruz, Hozier (whom I do not like), Tame Impala (LOVE), Childish Gambino (some songs ...not all), Boy Pablo (what a beautiful voice!), and a few other random musical acts.

Felt like the festivals grounds was more of a fairgrounds than geared towards music festival goers.  Been a long long time since I've been to a community local fair, but with all the booze-pushing salespeople and all the pushers of whatever...it really felt like I was at the circus rather than a music festival.

I did, however, like the options for healthy food instead of just hotdogs all the time.  Poutine??  Ummmmm.... No.... I do not eat Poutine.  That is THE most fattening food on the planet earth... hands down... hahahaaaa...  I will allow others to enjoy it tho...just leave me out of that.

Festivals goers seemed pretty occupied with themselves and their phones.  Or themselves and their specific ""wolf pack"".  Pretty oblivious bunch of people.  Will run into you or over you and will not care.

Maybe if there was a real dress code...and that is to dress UP, not down... and people would care more about running into others.

Coachella does a better job of inspiring people to dress UP.  It's nice when people do.  Much prettier humans to look at and it improves the entire festival experience.

Dress UP Montreal."
I saw 2! foxes here last night. Go around dusk and you may get lucky.
"A surprising pleasure, almost hidden for a great day trek for hiking, photography, and solitude. The Stewart Museum is an honest approach to very complicated history."
Piknik electronik is a great place to be if you love techno music in Nature!
I loved Osheaga!  I will DEFINITELY be back next year!
Ha ha ha... Had so much fun here... Electropicnic
Very informative for kids and adults we enjoyed alot
Great park for walks and photography. Historically interesting. Take the metro to get here!!!
The new festival site isn't as horrible as I thought.
"If you really want to enjoy here, come in the spring"
"Saw Guns n' Roses here, the sound and set up was great. Cool little island with other attractions as well. The only downside for some people is the long walk up to the actual music venue, but 15-20 minutes of walking didn't bother our group."
Great place to hang out in the evening
It's really nice. Great for walking about and having a picnic
We loved it loved it very much here! We went for the festivals week ends du monde and it was just so welcoming so warm so good! Food was great music drink people everything!! We went all the way from New Jersey USA
Nice pool...lots of green space...great place for concerts
It was my first time in Montreal and I can't expressed how beautiful this place was. It really helped me detox my mind from the routine life style and city life. Great and peaceful place to visit!
Nice parc with entertainment park swimming pool and lot of events during summer
Nice Park. Close to the city. Lots to do and see in nature.
Great place. They host the light the night walk. Very nice park. Great venue. Clean venue as well.
"Lots going on and something for everyone - nature walks, pool, history, music festivals etc"
"Saw Metallica, and went to Heavy Montreal 2019. Both were a Blast"
"beautifull parc in montreal , close of many attractions"
"Really cool park, you can do many nice walks and admire the biosphere and also go to the tower where there's a nice view 360¬∞. At the moment there's work but it'll be over next year."
Nice place
Currently undergoing a lot of renovation so lots of building sites and not much going on - also in off season. Enjoyed what we could see though and really look forward to going back when it's completed.
"Good place to go specially for
Heavy Montreal
üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
Formidable!
Very nice place for family getaway or jogging or just relax and having a picnic.
Has several outdoor games for family and kids. I strongly recommend. Note you have to pay to gain entrance
"This is a nice park within Montreal. Its not super large, but there is a very nice meadow with flowers where some people were reading"
"Yes
4.0"
Very nice place to visit
Great location with lots of variety and a very intuitive flow.
"Great place to unwind.. I strongly recommend that you visit ""la tour de L√©vis"".. breath taking views of the city."
"The frequent festivals held here definitely take a toll on the park. Grounds are constantly destroyed and grass is either dead or fake almost everywhere that hosts a stage. However, still a decent venue for such events."
"I went there in different seasons, no matter which one it's always beautiful, a very peaceful place to relax. During summer they have some BBQ areas to eat, very good!"
"It comes to life in the summers, nothing goes on in the winters. Every sunday people dance to live music. The vibe is hipster."
Lots to do for so cheap if your mtl
Pretty and the history of it being an old world expo site is cool.  Also there are the pupil bike stands where you can rent.  Beware there is a lot you can't see because there is so much construction.
This park is well maintained and great for a quiet picnic. Very family friendly
"Poor customer service.no one wants to speak English, bad for tourism. Always a line up to park and at the rides."
Really nice park
"Beautiful park, lots of shade and places to chill out"
Nice mas cold
Just spectacular. Like nowhere else in Montreal. Must visit
Horrible traffic. Took us 2.5hrs to get back home after La Ronde closed at 9pm.
must be back
"I've been there on beer festival, very exited. Lots of beer and rock concert at the end."
Fort in the middle
Total rip off! $27 for a day of parking during a major festival with tons of visitors from our of town. It's a hefty $10 surcharge to regular prices. The Society du Parc Jean Deapeau and the city should be ashamed of themselves for that modern form of highway robbery. Parking at the airport is cheaper than that
Horrible traffic on a Saturday evening. 2 hours to get out of it by car.
Urban oasis. Take Metro yellow line have a picnic
"It's all about ""Picknick √âlectrique"" every Sunday during the summer season. Life DJs performing sweet sounds in a chilled park environment."
Cool place to visit with family.
"If you want chill in a green field, forest, near the st. Laurent river, and The  Mtl city, best place to be!"
Good. But very few people here.
So much construction. Was there for a climbing competition and wanted to check out the venue. I‚Äôve heard great things about this park but the huge amount of construction ruined the atmosphere
Riding bikes and sight seing awesome
Visited in October. Everything except the Biosphere closed and the whole place like a building site.
A beautiful area with lots of interesting events
Nice park
Osheaga event was well organized !
Great place for the famous Heavy Montreal Festival. The park is well maintained and lots of shade. Easy access.
"Nice park, watch out for the skunks though, one stuck its tail up because I rode past it on my bike"
The place is under construction.. We kind of lost our way.. But the biosphere is amazing. Makes you think about the environment
Great place for cultural events
We went there at night to have a walk. Nice city view.
Family fun
Nice parc with entertainment park swimming pool and lot of events during summer
"Easy to reach with the subway. I only visited during winter when running the hypothermic half marathon, but I definitely want to visit in the summer now."
"huge! expect to spend all day here, there's so much to do and see. Just wished there were more bixi bike stations here to make it easier to navigate through this ginormous park"
"Nice nature, a lot of parkings"
Must go nice & beautiful island of Montreal
Jean Drapeau during the piknic electronic is amazing. A little bit crowdy though
"Such a wonderful place...
First of all it was so easy to get to. And then the number of activities there are so many... There is something for everyone. From the Stewart Museum to the biosphere dome to the piknic elektronic festival and the beach and the Giles Villenueve circuit .. it's easily such a wonderful wholesome place"
very nice park next to the Biosphere...
This park is beautiful. We went for oshega but the view of the water and the hike were also great.
Love it. Perfect calisthenics parc
Very fun
Simply love everything about this place
One of the best park of Montreal. Great views over the city and the river
Quite and beautiful
"Great place to be. Spent the afternoon there, there's a lot to see. Needs around 3-4 hours"
Taking away the cycling on iles Notre Dame really drops the stars for me. No reason to close the pool as well. They could have done the construction around the summer period.
Every Sunday like this.. I love it
"Beautiful place, but so much more / better can be done"
"For everybody. Good for walking, pic nic, cicling, enjoying nature. Beautiful and huge."
"Very nice family park
Beautifull view and easy acess from metro."
Best open air venue in the country
Enjoyable venue for the event.
One of the best places in Montreal for chill out and fun!
"Great park. Can be icy during the winter so take your ice grippers. Easy access from Jean-Drapeau Metro located on the Yellow Line. The Fete des Neiges is a great and affordable event, with free access and lots of things to see for free. Lots of food trucks there for the event. I thought the chalet was a great touch. Also the 1.5  km of ice paths are open to complement Fete des Neiges, and offer incredibly beautiful skating paths; the beautiful views of Montreal could leave you breathless. This is the only time the ice paths are maintained and in 2018 they were open for 8 week-end days."
OSHEAGA!! 2019
Beautiful park .. olease take the subway ... easy access by the subway if not there is parking but $$
"Was here for heavy mtl! Great show, well organized and was kept very clean"

"Great place to walk, or just relax looking at the surroundings."
Heavy MTL was awesome
Beautiful park but it was really difficult to find our way around. If you miss a turn you'll end up back on the highway having to start over again
This place is so quiet and so fun to walk and relaxe. You feel the nature.
Was here for Osheaga. Would go again.
There are always fun activities! I just love going at piknik!

"Undoubtedly my favorite spot in Montreal. Ever since I came to know about this place, I love it !"

Half an hour in traffic to find out that La Ronde was closed from the parking attendant.

Great open space with lots of activities for kids.

Great park but why there has to be sand. Takes awhile to clean my kids. There are other parks with better solution but still this is a very good Park. My solution to take off sand from my kids is to roll them down the hill lol.

"It's a park, what else can be said!"

"An okay park, pedestrians feel they own the whole place though, I try to ride my bike off the bike path since it is secluded from the park, which is also quite."
Beautiful and convenient!  It's a busy city park and it's easy to see why - it's got everything families want.
Great swimming pool with amazing lifeguards
Football & baseball fields
"Very nice park named after the st-laurent borough in Montreal. It has a plethora of activities including baseball, basketball, swimming, tennis, football and kids games. It's definitely one of the best parks in St-laurent."
Perfect place for sledding!
"Unbelievably horrible experiences with the parking on poirier/muir. Even though there are security guards they do nothing to address the constant losers that smoke up in their cars day and night. I don't even know why arrondissement Saint-Laurent pays these ""security guards"" (except for ticketing of course).
For some reason we can't step on the football field either because our taxes pay for the entire park but god forbid the football players play on already stepped on grass. It's not an NFL tournament guys."
awesome
Clean and huge .kids have fun
Decent looking park.. not much else

"Montreal is a city that has a very large number of small parks nestled in between buildings. If you live close to one of them, consider yourself lucky. Parc Victor Daubigny is tiny, but it has a few benches for those of us who get tired of being cooped up indoors for prolonged periods."
I live opposite this park and it is a great outlet for the kids.
Lovely parc. Has a swimming pool for toddlers not for the bigger children. Slide is for 3+ not much for toddlers to play on.
Fun place for Dogs and great for Kids.
Hockey is good! 2 ice!!
I like all parks in Montreal

"Nice city park to enjoy your ice cream, coffee or anything you bring with you, alcohol are not permitted though.

The park has a lot of bench and sone picnic table and enough green spaces to lounge around and enjoy the sunshine or the shade depending on what you prefer.

Today, I was lucky, It was really windy and not too hot, perfect temperature to read a good book outside and enjoy the last days of springs."
"This is a huge, clean, spacious park. I particularly like the fountains at the entrance. Cute spot in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood."
"Not too shabby, this place is what I whould call quite relaxing while also being big enough to have applause given to it.I don't know if it will be for everyone but who knows.Maybe most will have the same opinion as me."
"Full of happy kids , parents, lovers, podcasters, smokers, tokers,drinkers,readers. The sunset was glorious."
"Beautiful in the spring time. Water, baby and big kids park + gym spot for adults."
"This is a wonderful park for the kids! There are water activities, a bike trail and plenty of playground equipment. It is also just a nice spot to spend a relaxing afternoon chatting or having an outdoor lunch."

This park is great!  For families and picniking with friends.  Bring yourself some music and have a small gathering under the trees!
"What a beautiful green space with plenty of spots to relax, get some sun, exercise, and play with the kids."
"Lovely park. The water fountains are best I have seen so far. Adults and children can play in the fountains. The play area is small, however there is ample space to hold barbeque, relaxing in the sun and for spending some time"
Clean quiet park with a fair size splash pad for the kids. Lots of shade and tables .
Nice place with trees and water park ish. Next to grocery store. But next to highway. (loud)
"So much fun for the kids, just perfect"
Just beautiful
Cause all my friends chill there
Beautiful park on st Catherine east. Not very big but not too small also. A lot of space to chill and relax in a green environment with beautiful water features.
Great playgrounds and a nice water park section for kids to cool off.
"Great installations for all ages, clean , including public bathrooms"
"Probably one of the better parks in this neighborhood, toilets available (currently closed due to covid) and field for petanque, water feature for kids and lounge chairs for summertime chilling. Loads of homelessness and rather unkept at times though..."
Its a nice place to relax and enjoy a few watergame with the kids
great view nice park
Great for kids! The fountains are super refreshing in summer. The open air calisthenics bars are a great addition too.
Cool
"What a great park! Nice shade, greatly playgrounds and a unique splash pad. Will return"

Great parc loved it. Nice friendly safd a qstwr features make for a pleasant  walk.
Beautiful  people were friendly
"Great park for the whole family. Fountains, water games, and exercise equipment abound."
CrossFit or bar stars workout available. Super nice setting. Call in the evening. Very nice place and benches are far enough from each other to have privacy.
"very nice park.  there was a local music group playing while our little one played in the splash pad.  more swings in the playground would be nice, i think there were only 4 of the 6 placed."
Cute park with lots of activities for kids.
Wonderful park. One section for the little ones; another section for the elder ones; one section for adults to do training; and one section to play with water. Definitively a good place to enjoy in family.
Beautiful park in that lifeful neighborhood. The show de ruelle tonight was awsome!

"Very nice park, lots of places for the kids to play, highly recommend it"

Gets very noisy sometimes as area is not large,  but children have enough activities here  to do: 2 types of swings, slides, a few benches for parents etc."
Impressed by exercise equipment for over 55 years.
A very nice and cozy place for families. Nice playground for kids and good exercising equipment for adults.
Seems to be a nice park for 4 to 8 year olds.  Lots of children with parents.
Love this place.
It was fun
It is a small park but it has everything for kids. It has sport tools for adults also to do exercises.
"Pas super tripper, beau parc pour les enfants avec jeux d'eau mais bon le gazon es rough pour la face"
Parks automatically get 5 stars from me
It's a big parc but I find it boring to go there. In my books it's not a very nice parc to hangout
This place is so special spent almost every evening last summer here playing basketball and football.
pure beauty
"Big and quiet location. From Softball, Skate Ramp, Basketball court and a Tennis Court. Nice place to bring your kids and just enjoy a funfill day."
"This is a nice neighbourhood park. It doesn't have as much equipment as in the past for children, yet there is plenty of space for a sports game, bocce,  biking, tennis/badminton and a beautiful pool. I was disappointed they wouldn't let me swim with shorts and T-shirt. Apparently city law only allows people with swimsuits."
It's diverse but there is too much left over space
Nice park alot of activities for kids during the summer
"Nice park with A LOT of space with a basketball court, a skate park and a tennis court as well"
Pomal b.s
Best place to play outside basketball

Good park
"Pathways and cycling lanes makes this park a must see in nearby Lachine. With views of the St Lawrence River and the historic canals, i recently spent some time photographing its' character using a modified camera. Whether you come for exercise or relaxation, the Park has many amenities and is accompanied by exceptional views."
"The park is amazing. Has outstanding view to the river. You can watch the beautiful sunset. You are free to barbecue and have fun with your family. It is a good place for ridding bicycle, exercising, running, playing skate and etc. It is one of my favourite place to visit."
"Big and open park which is great as it‚Äôs not accesible by car, only walking or by bike.

It‚Äôs a great bike path around the island and river family friendly.

Not too many outdoor park games for kids"
"Always a great place to hang out with toddlers and kids up to 6-7 and sneak in some adult conversation. Lovely mature trees and hedges - a reliable place for hunting snails. Mind that it's quite a bit windier now. The adjacent depot was knocked down and there's a pit taking it's place. If you focus on your kids and just look westward toward the handy CCI, you can almost forget about the surrounding construction."
Great Park for kids and birthday party.
Nice place to explore and reconcile with nature. The ravine is pretty cool to walk through.
"Super nice park where you can enjoy the view from a little mountain also this park nice paths to walk around, it has a dog park, I love to walk around here in the morning, you can see downtown Montr√©al from here"
"Cosy calm natural place, with a bunch of little paths, great for a little walk on the morning!"
Relaxing and peaceful.
Nice green place wich is rare cause of condos money
"Very nice park, nature and quite. It's very good idea to have a walk."
One of my favorite spots to escape the city. You can take a walk in this hidden nature preserve and have a little peace.
I had a great time with my gf. We went there to take some photo for modeling. This place is so romantic. We went at night and the feeling is really different.
Very nice parc to see different bird's

Small wild park with rear birds.
Very small little wood. Dogs allowed.
very nice and green parc
En peque√±o bosque con varios senderos o caminerias que permite cortar camimo desde la rue Belanger y el carrefour Langelier. Es muy utilizado por los vecinos del sector para ir a hacer compras y ahorrase algunos metros de caminata. La mejor √©poca para utilizar estos senderos en de la primavera al oto√±o.

Very nice park for kids to play. This place is very nice for family and friends to picnic and hangout especially during summer. A huge place to walk and accessible to all.

Nice park to do your daily walk.
I loved the fresh air and the nice breeze.
"Nice flowering trees, decent size."
One of best ! Kids friendly park. Our kids loved playing in a sand as well as water play area. You might want to bring bathings and/or towels   Or extra clothes for boys because they will define jump in.
Best for morning and evening walk. Water fountain and kids special playing spot.
Nice place for all age group of ppl. But some teenagers smoke weed near kids playing area which is unacceptable

Nice place. Cricket pitch. Water fountain. Table tennis.
"Enjoyed a chill Sunday afternoon after the library, picked up some apples and fresh carrots, broccoli and dip, a bag of apples and had a quick picnic. There were kids playing in the little water fountain and though I did have to dodge a few potshots from a tiny sharpshooter's water pistol, I managed to stay dry. Some other kiddos were kicking a soccer ball around, some gentlemen were enjoying a game of cricket under a sunny afternoon sky. Great place for a nice walk with someone or a sit down under a tree with a book."
very nice and big park also the seats gives you a view on all the games so it's easy to keep an eye on kids.
"Great place, has open swimming pool open till 18:30"
"This park is a great place to hang out with your friends or family. Especially during summer, you can bike there, play soccer, or do some jogging. They also have a playground for children which is amazing for families. They have public washroom as well, so its very convenient. I recommend this park for sure . Its also located near the grocery store IGA if ever you're looking for food, snacks and drinks."
I spend my evenings here. This is the only place where i feel relaxed. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll be in upcoming days but i will ever remember this park. A lot of memories are attached
Love this place. Good for kids
Park was beautiful. Be cautious of people however. My 2 sons were approached by someone accusing them of bullying her nefew. My children aren't bullies. I was at the bench next to my boys when I asked the lady if their was an issue because adults should be speaking to adults and not approaching children in parks. She and her mutt sister decided to verbally attack me in front of my children. Classy!! Be careful!
Nice place to play Cricket
"The park itself with what it has to offer is nice. However, it is very dirty. Trash bags are not emptied as frequently as they should so trash flies off and soil all the play area!! Too bad. Emailed the municipality many times but no reply and no action taken. Shame."
It's good .. nice playground for kids but i think they should put more  '' sable '' under the slides bcz my baby almost hurt herself because the distance beetween the slide and the ground is very big ... and somebody should consider cleaning little bit just saying
It ha jogging track..nice park
A great place to bring your kids.
"Park Van Horne is suitable for children because there are many activities available there, but for adults, nothing is really interesting."
Nice place for kids
A beautiful way to walk home from work!
Simple and nice park in Montreal.
Nice park to roam around and play games
Very proud of the new renovations! Awesome ping pong table! However it would be nice if they unchained the soccer nets during summer or sometime during the year...
"Near plamondon Metro Station, with iga, Tim Hortons, subway and everything nearby"
Fun park for kids
It's nice to walk through it on the way home.
"lots of cricket players. The park is recently renovated the the anemeties are clean, safe , and new. The have a water park. No more kiddy pool though. Near a strip mall so it's fast to get refreshments or lunch. I wish they would make a giant skating rink here."
Small tidy park adjacent to the community center. Waterworks in summer. Nice place.

"not a small park, many tables and benches for picnic , large play ground..."
Nice place for a picnic and you're allowed to BBQ here. The scenery is breathtaking mostly during the sunset.
"This marina has world class potential, but sadly its owned by the government so its extremely dilapidated, not taken care of and everything is falling apart... I recently learned that they will turn the whole thing into some sort of swamp lol... They said it would cost 16M to fix the marina, but 35M to build the swamp... how bout you save the tax payers 16M by selling it to the private market... they'll never do that cause MTL government is the mafia"
"Tr√®s beau, bien h√¢te d‚Äôy voir des spectacles!"
"Beautiful park great for outdoor sports like Basketball, Soccer, Tennis, Hockey, etc. There is an all season rink for ball hockey which is super convenient. There is also a playground for youngsters and the entire park is next to an outdoor public pool which opens in the afternoon. Overall a great place for weekend activities!"
Beautiful and quiet park. A wonderful place to practice sports
"Really nice parc. It has a section for kids, a section for water games and a huge and clean soccer field for practices and games. At night the lights turn on and you feel like you are in a completely different place. The soccer field is made of synthetic grass which means that shoes with cleats are strongly recommended if you don't want to slip and embarrass yourself in front of everyone. I would definitely go back there and play with friends or family."
"Great play parc for young kids, the playground floor is a rubber type material for the 4yo + section. Some of the floor section are damaged and a few installation are slightly damaged (both spinning structures) but overall a lot of fun !!!"
Great Parc with a variety of sport fields including an outdoor swimming pool. Expect it to be very packed on the weekends.
"This is an amazing park
Tons of services, starting spring till end of autumn the park is busy with young and old, many ppl go there for sport practice, ride their bike, walk the dog, kids play in the playground area and many grown ups get to mingle together
There‚Äôs a swimming pool attached to the park and a cantine that serves a small area both in the swimming area and the park so one can buy a sofa or a bag of chips
Whenever we r bored we always hang around the park, two large play area for kids one area has sand and one soft ground
2 large football court, baseball field, hockey circle, basketball court and 4 tennis fields, bike area, a chalet that offer washrooms and some activities, few tables near the cantine  where most ppl do an outdoor birthday party and an activity dog park, hills for bike lovers or walkers and lots of space and benches to sit around the park

Amazing
Nice park well maintain
Great site.
"JA Richard Park is one of several parks in Verdun that border the St Lawrence river. You have 2 parallel trails to choose from. The one that is closest to the river - you can get your feet wet if that's what you're looking for - is preferred by those who want to stay away from the much larger crowd that uses the main trail. The main trail is wider and easier of access, especially for people who are here to bike."
Excellent place for all the family. Nearby Verdun's Beach. With a place that sells delicious icecream and cold treats!
"Nice park, great big spaces, good view."
"Beautiful next to the river. There is a boat ramp with easy access and the Crescendo restaurant
in case you want a full meal , snack or drink."
Great green place to picnic. Tables all around. Splash and children's park nearby. Lots of trees. Great view of the river. Cremerie also near.
"Beautiful spot by the Saint-Laurent river in Verdun. Lots of trees and space to appreciate nature, walk, ride your bike or simply stay quietly for a  while."
"I like it and so do the kids!
Water games, big climbing spiderweb, 2 different playing areas, a little ice cream shop nearby, and a great walk by the water a few steps away."
Pace of mind and beautiful nature is the real name of this park
"This is an amazing park, where you can walk your dog's, make a BBQ, chill, have a nice moment with friends and family. The great location in front of the St Laurent river gives it a spectacular place to relax. Great location to visit if you live or visit Verdun"
Really pretty park. You can actually ride your bike west from here all along the river to the end of the island if you can.
"It's a great spot when the weather is nice, you just need to come early or stick around if you want the best shade/places to sit down by the water, it gets pretty packed, and fast!"
"A great park along the river, beautiful in summer time, and groomed cross-country ski trails in the winter time that extend from Parc Arthur-Therrien in the north down to the Marina (And more trails if you continue South into Lasalle)."
"Very cute place to hang out at, definitely recommend for groups and dates üòâ"
"Good place to take out pizza to and eat it as if it was a picnic. However, seagulls are friendlier when you do so."
"Very nice park, a lot of green space and playgrounds!"
Best place to unwind

Ok but cops complained about us not social distancing
"Walk this place almost daily, year 'round. Summer is the worst, it is full of people and they litter the place it is unbelievable."
Great park and full activities for all !!!
Fun
Great place to hang out and enjoy the sun. Right next to the city but feels far away from the urban noise and rush
Really great urban waterfront park. Plenty of area and a wide variety of options for ways to enjoy it
One word....beautiful!
"Beautiful sunrises, sunsets by the St-Laurent river.  Cyclable path, skate park, games for kids and adults, swimming pools, tennis courts, baseball courts,  fishing and soon a beach.  What more can you ask.  I love Verdun and the south west by the river."
Perfect
Amazing natural peacefull place. Best place for children for playing outdoor games and for elder a peacefull place.
"Hi! This location is great to take pictures or videos of the landscape, sunrise or the sunset. You can also run, walk, walk your dog  etc. Near this park, you can visit also the marina of Verdun. There is lots of photos opportunities. Is already the fall so get your camera and go and shoot."
Very nice park. Good mix of young kid equipment and bigger kid playground. There is even a water area.
So much fun
Beautiful and nice
Great place... you can find kids playground +  fountains
Nice place during the summer. There is a nice restaurant with a ice cream place. Also  water jets for the kids to play in right next to the playground. All this right in front of the st laurent river.

Great park to chill
It's tooo pleasant for a summer evening to hangout with nature

"Nice park in Verdun.  Went there for a child's party and parking was close, bathrooms accessible and there was a large playground for the kids.  Park was clean with lots of pathways."
It was a very nice park the only thing I didn't like was that the city doesn't clean the very high weeds next to the water so you can't enjoy the view .
This parc is a place to take the kids to in the summer
It is  so nice
"Great parc with kids playground and water jets, a restaurant and a bike path that extends to the rest of the parks by the water in Verdun and LaSalle.

Good spot to relax all around as well as appreciate the views of the river. There's even a dock with some boats and there's many spots along the river where people fish."
Peaceful environment.
"Beautiful waterfront park, great to walk dogs (on leash, don't be inconsiderate). Picnics in the summer, cross country skiing in the winter."
Lovely space. Lots of amenities around. Hard to find parking though.
We enjoyed a nice walk along the river and a picnic while the kids played in the playground. There are several playgrounds including a small water park.
If you like to bike like us just look at there maps and ride all day
"A park, its fun. You do park things. It has water. I think?"
Perfect place for a stroll when you don't have enough free time to go outside of Montreal.
A perfect place to sit by the water and read. Very calm for being so close to the city.
"Great for the summer and winter activities. Pool, bike path, sliding, everything is free as long as you are a Mtler."
My son loves this place. It is a very big park with many activities.
Awesome park!

Muy hermoso parque para disfrutar la naturaleza y mucho espacio
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Tr√®s color√©s et bonne senteur .
Beautiful age old place to relax by the fast moving St Lawrence river. Lots of birds and fast moving rapids.Dont let kids get close. Too dangerous. Fishers must wear life jackets. Nice place for a picnic lunch for a small group.
"Clean,Park, Free parking, lots of tables to eat at with your love ones & family and outdoor gatherings are permitted, as long as respecting the protocols.
Very nice views. Beautiful place to take your kids. Beautiful place to walk, long walks, bicks not allowed inside"
"Nice place to go for a walk. Free parking available, but very small, ample enough parking on the street. Narrow trails and people not wearing masks (since it's outdoors) and though there are signs to keep to the right throughout the entire ‚Ä¶"
A nice park to walk on. It has beautiful view to the river
A very peaceful and clean place. Great idea to have free parking. Missing a bathroom is needed.
"Terrific, beautiful park at the edge of Verdun.  Definitely worth visiting while in the area.  Great place for biking, throwing a ball around, playing some volleyball, or even going swimming.  Check out the surfers in the rapids."
It's come a long way since I was going there aw a young teenager with friends. More and more wildlife making there home there  and now my youngest gets to enjoy it. I could spend a day there without realizing it!
"Amazing location. A fairy wonderland! Peace and tranquility on one side, chaos and the awesome power of nature on the other. One of Montreal greatest parks. The work by the maintenance team is A+"
"Part of the linear park, this is a beautiful place to walk, snowshoe - when there's enough new fallen snow, cross country ski (classic) in tracked paths, build snow sculptures when the snow is right, and go sledding on the slopes that are created by the city workers.
Dress warm, covering for your face essential when it gets windy - the wind off tge water gets mightily cold - a windproof shell over a warm layer works best + hat + mitts.
Walking out on the small peninsula, one can see sone great (little) rapids."
Beautiful and tranquile. The bird sanctuary is home to many beautiful fauna and other wild life.
Great place to walk and see birds and ducks and geese.
"Nice walk, good to see wildlife, just respect their space. Fun for the whole family."
Extremely beautiful lake view! Beautiful Canada goose!
"Beautiful views, lots of birds, a nice walking path."
Very clean lots of space right onto the rapids fun and enjoyable. Many benches to sit and lots of garbage cans so its clean as
Beautiful park with nice walking trail. Fantastic nature. Water bodies around are amazing. Can spot some birds like ducks and seagulls. View of the rapids are brilliant and soothing to just sit and relax in the park.
"Really good place to take some air and take a long walk on,only issue would be the eminence amount of Canadian Geese"
"So lovely,  peaceful place that you can listen to water flows and observe a lot of Canada goose."
"This is where I go for my morning walk every day. You‚Äôll see plenty of geese with their young in the month of May and plenty of other wildlife.  My only complaint is that I feel the borough is cutting down numerous trees for what I see as no reason.  I could understand if a tree is dead so be it, but to cut down trees that appear healthy and strong and then just leave the stumps all over the place is despicable.  Also, who gets to keep all that firewood? Hmm ... Another complaint I have is the over zealous cutting down of plants deemed to be invasive such as phragmites and mullein. To some these plants may be an eyesore but to others they are a thing of beauty.  These plants beautify the shoreline but some people just can‚Äôt see that."
Calming and peaceful especially when  you watch the water flow.... u can also run along the water. It a sight to not be missed
"Great little piece of nature steps from the city. Though, as often when it's free, it attracts people that just don't know how to live in society."
"A beautiful park to unwind in, alongside the river. Always beautiful no matter what season!"
Beautiful place went on windy day today but definitely will love to comeback soon (summer time) üëç
Great park with lots of views of goslings in the spring and early summer
Absolutely amazing. Such a nice nature with spectacular views of waves and seabirds.
"Wow, it's great to feel nature within the city at this sanctuary, should bring small picnic basket after the visit seat adjacent the sanctuary on the provided picnic tables and look at it while munching."
"Great parc, some picnic tables are available."
They added some swings this summer and I found it super cool.
"Bird sanctuary with stunning views to St Laurent river and Montreal Downtown.
Rowrs of water is very relaxing Great place overall. Parking is limited though"
"Nice place to enjoy with family  ,"
really nice. A good spot for a walk or an afternoon out.
Very nice place
A picture perfect place for a picnic or peaceful get away.
Love this place. Whenever I just want to take a walk I go there. Amazing view and never too crowded
It's Nice and calm place in the busy Montreal City. Here you can see and do some adventure sport like river rafting on tremendous rapids on saint Lawrence river. Park it self is good for family picnic and get to gether. You can also enjoy bicycle ride with your kids and your friends. If you want to do some fishing then also you can do here. In short it's a full family enjoyment and weekend place. So visit and feel relaxed on your busy life.
"Enjoy walking there, very nice and beautiful."

One of the best place in Montreal. I am not sure why this is not that famous but this place is equally amazing or better than any other place.
Nice ecological walking trail and watching the Rapids are amazing.
I sat by the water eating a ice cream was peaceful.
Always amazing!! The water has a calming effect. Great to be out in nature
"Great for bird watching, great views. Some nice fishing spots, bring a life jacket"
Went there to take some pictures by the river. Great preserve. A lot of wildlife and a pleasant walk. Plenty of parking.
It's a very nice place to ride a bike or relax and watch the river.
"nice place, don't fall in the water!"
I can walk here every day. This place never gets old.
"Been here because the national park was full. And the rapids are quite impressive to look at. Other than that, it's a casual walk with a path in the nature."
"A lot of cute bench and picnic areas along the park, or rocks near the water you can sit by amd watch the rapids. Bikes need to be docked before entering the rapida park area. Wonderful view!"
Beautiful and peaceful place.  Less humans around so makes even better. Winds are deafening but worth it
"Close to the water, it's nice to chill"
One of the best parks in Verdun. Verdun Beach is overrated but this in my opinion is underrated. Waves are charming and beautiful. Must see if you live in Montreal.
Amazing place to observe the power of nature
Love the area! No need to go far to enjoy this pearl of the nature.
Peaceful and beautiful place. Must visit.
Very beautiful and peaceful place. A must visit for bird lovers. Lot of benches to sit and enjoy. Can rent bixi cycles also. Convenient to reach by public transport.

Nice place for a walk or small picnic.
It's hard to explain how beautiful this place is. You need to go feel it.
Stunning views and some great lookouts. Very muddy paths if after rain.  Needs improvement. So worth visiting though.
beautiful park to go for a one hour walk. Not really for hiking  but still the scenery is gorgeous especially on a sunny day. Not easily accessible by metro :(
"Fantastic getaway into nature beauties.
I love it all the year round.
Early mornings when the fog is coming up above the water or in winter after heavy snowfall: when the trees are all white and silent"
Its amazing great view
"Awesome easy walk next to the river and the sound of the rapids is just so soothing and beautifulüíú no public toilet though close by, or we did not see one. Other than that you can have a little picnic there with family."
Great place very clean and relaxing
"Wonderful place to visit for meditation, picnic, walk or run, even for fishing."
"A gorgeous place to walk even in a context of physical distancing. Beautiful vistas, cool benches and tables with an Art Nouveau styling, and easy to spend hours outside."

Amazing place to go and visit
Great natural Parc
The view was perfect.
"Beautiful park, I loved it"

"Beautiful, but I find the rules a bit excessive"
"Beautiful walking paths , nicely maintained. Lots of space , trees . Ideal spot to relax, picnic or play games . Certain parts have Canada geese roaming around , which is nice . For the more adventurous folks, there is a lovely beaten path along the shore."
Beautiful view.Nice park with great bick path and walking trails.
Everything was clean and proper
Great place to walk & bike
"I love it there, the sound of birds, river, and wind. What a masterpiece. It has bicycle road. Not crowded. Even the smell is very nice, really peaceful place, the only problem is there are so many bugs there."
Another beautiful day...I love MTL!
Was waiting for this place to open all pandemic. :) Wonderful piece to see the rapides. No safety fence so keep an eye out for your kids. The sounds of the waves are really calming.
"One of the most breathtaking parks in the city. Surrounded by water, and populated by countless species of birds, it's an ideal place for a relaxing stroll or a picnic."
It was a nice park to stop by and take a short walk around with kids.
Great place for a sit down n relax!!
"Beautiful place! Room to move, Rapids are spectacular. Don't forget your binoculars. Lots to see."
Great place.
Beautiful Day! üåû
"It was a beautiful day today and as always, it was very nice to take a walk in Des Rapides Park. If you ever have questions about the park or about any of the wildlife that is around, or even about what kind of fish üêü are in the river, there is usually someone that is working there that can answer your questions."
Beautiful park. It's a great place to relax in nature.
Love it at the rapids.   Fun to watch the surfers
"Great place to go relax.
Also a bird sanctuary.
Ahhhh"
Breathtakingly beautiful park you can visit all year long.

Very nice park‚ò∫Ô∏è
loved it absolutely........best for walks jogging picnics and romantic advances
"Beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, most of it was closed due to covid restrictions. But I'll definitely be back when this is all over!"
Maybe my favorite park on the entire island of Montreal. Maybe a little too restrictive but things need to be protected.
"Beautiful park beside Lawrence river, good outing spot for families .just 30 mins from downtown.Take metro to STATION DE L'√âGLISE and take Bus #58 to 5th avenue....there is a nice cafe opposite to this park where they serve yummy sandwiches, icecreams, wraps."

Great place to hang out. Lots of quiet spots by the river.
Best place to feel the power of St-Laurent
"the water mesmerizes, the beautiful wrought iron tables and benches invite reflection and watching the plantings grow up over the years is a great pleasure!"
Beautiful despite the cloudy conditions
"The place is currently closed, but you can have an extremely peaceful walk along the riverside and enjoy the company of the geese, multiple insects and animals which poop on the grass, make sure to bring protection for both scenarios"
A protected bird sanctuary and an excellent place for a stroll or picnic. Great for the kids and the entire family. It offers a unique view of nature within the city. The view is of the Lachine rapids are amazing. Great place for picture taking and bird watching. It's also a good place to fish. Easily accessible and there's ample parking and best it's situated along the bike path.
Great place for a brisk Sunday afternoon walk.

"Good place to hangout, every where it shws open but when you visit it is closed. That's disappointment we had to face.. other than nature is calling you"
So facinating place.
"Such amazing connection with the nature inside this big town! Everything is breathtaking : vegetation, wildlife and the rapids."
Beautiful place. Not too crowded.
Lovely quite place tons of animals got to see some baby geese and a groundhog lots of birds
"5 stars for how close you can sit by the water and the amazing waves of water on the south side. There is a significant variety of nooks to stop and sit or simply take in the many panoramic views along the peninsula. The walkway, starting a short distance from the adjacent bike path towards the water begins with a calm lake on the right (west side) and then marsh-like scenery to the left once you start heading towards the peninsula."
Beautiful scene winter spring summer and fall
Beautiful space
Very nice
"Nice park, unfortunately Rapids section is closed off right now so couldnt see them"
"The beautiful park where the Island meets the river and you can walk along the mighty lachine rapids. There's abundant bird life including great blueherons, Canada geese, ducks, red wing black birds and more."
Very nice view
It is the river of LaSalle.
Perfect spot for fresh and delicious food!
Nice place to walk and picnic in the summer
"Great place. It has rapid waters on one side and completely calm waters on the other. Beautiful in any time of the year.
More people on weekends. So if you would like to really enjoy the calmness and beauty of it - come weekdays anytime.
A lot of birds of different kinds, sometimes migrating and will be on this peninsula for a few weeks then disappear for years...
You'll love it.
My favorite place for years."
Its awesome
"1st time walking here since its been fixed up with paths. Very peaceful,  benches to rest and enjoy the water and scenery.  Beautiful sounds of nature.  Hope to go back soon."
"Took a walk last night, in December. Was pretty cold and windy but ...no bugs! Yeah, very nice calm walk in this beautiful natural park, will go back again and again. Recommended."
Beautiful place
So beautiful
Amazing... simple as that!!!
There is plenty of parking. It is a peaceful and relaxing walk.
"Beautiful place for share with family, friends or even alone."
"The rushing water swirling around this island Park is hypnotic. No bicycles allowed in the park, but it's easy to walk the full length and the views are amazing. Easy to get free parking in the entrance or nearby on the street. This place is special, worth the trip and the walk. Electric wheelchairs and similar modes of transportation are permitted."
Very spectacular park with great view toward lake!
Good place to relax
Beautiful green space. Great view of the rapids. Many species of birds to see there and sometimes even beavers.
It's a nice place to just chill or to cycle or engage in other activities
Love the scenery. Lovely place to take walk and bike.
what a beautiful park!
Ok
My favourite park
Great place to relax and enjoy lasalle
"A very very nice park, big, and clean, very special place."
Beautiful park hiding in Nuns Island.
Another sweet nature spot in Montreal
Love to spent time whenever I can
"On days you just want to sit back in contentment, and reflect in silence. This is the place for you. I describe it as nature's serenity. Very amazing landscape."
Very nice park. Best biking trail ever! Also nice to see people surf
You can take very nice & long nature walks in this Park but beware of mosquitos & mud since it's by the water .
A hidden gem right in the city! The trails are beautiful to walk and watching the rapids speed by is both calming and invigorating. We go there everytime we visit the city in the summer.
Beautiful nature
Nice place but not many benches to sit
Very quite and clean place beside st lawrence river to enjoy fresh air all year!
"Hidden gem of a park on the edge of the Island. Many spots for fishing or just simply to be on the edge of water, lots of wild life but birds are what caught my attention the most. My new favourite park in Montreal."
"A wonderful natural spot for Plein Air Painting.  Everywhere you look, there's a painting to be made!"
A little piece of nature's heaven in the city.
Good place to relax and read a book
"Absolutely beautiful place to spend the afternoon! Pack a picnic and the fishing gear and fo have yourself one hell of an enjoyable afternoon!!! Bring a camera,,, there are lots of beautiful things to snap away at!!! Especially the baby geese,, they are adorable!!! Peace out and pay it forward everyone!!"
Take a bicycle ride to Parc des Rapides if you live in the area.
"Good variety, I seldom go there.

You can find stuff that you cannot find in some other places.

Good quality stuff!

I would go there every time in the future.

You should look at what they offer and choose what is best for you!

Very nice place and I will go there again in the future, I like that is not far from where I live and it‚Äôs not very busy in the week-ends.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find it pleasant easy accessible and comforting."
"Great place for activities! Whether for a walk, a run, a bike ride or just to chill, this is a great place near the Lachine rapids. Ducks, geese and if you are lucky a little aquatic mammal"
Good place üëç
Amazing place
"This is a beautiful park where one can relax, walk, or enjoy the views.  The birds are tame and will not run away.  They will actually approach you.  There are many of them long the paths and in the water.  The quiet water and the rapids are breathtaking.  At a temperature of 25C outside, the cool breeze feels wonderful.  There are many beautiful places to sit down and enjoy.  I did."
This is an amazing place with gorgeous view
"It's a good place to walk and bike, the view of the rapids is spectacular."
Very nice place to take a walk or go fishing. Parking is free too wich is great. I enjoy the place alot since its not too far from my home. I recommend it.
"Very beautiful in fall. But at the start of summer, as there is no greenery yet, it is much like a forest full of leaf-less trees. And we can enjoy kayaking near the park. So, it's a beat place for a desperate day-off."
Great park by the river.
"Great view, near the river side... Great for a jog or a Sunday stroll with family"
"What a nice walk to go around the Parc des Rapides. Moreover, we met the friends of the Rapids Park, it was enriching."
"Peaceful and relaxing. Take your time and smell the roses. Stop and dip your feet in the cool lake. I actually got to see a Heron sitting on a rock with the cool rapid waters over it's feet, awaiting it's prey."
Beautiful and peaceful. Amazing birds.
There's a nice walk to a point where you can see the rapids. Best in the spring when the water is high.
Beautiful
Very beautiful and close to nature
Big park with lots of trees. Perfect for a Sunday picnic or playing frisbee. Doggos welcome‚ù§Ô∏è
One of the prettiest parks around. Parking can be a bit difficult but definitely worth it. Watch out for geese poop!
The nicest Park in LaSalle!!
"This is one of my favorite places to go for a nice walk, and enjoy the beautiful scenery !!!"
Nice parc but Dogs are forebiden even on leash.
"A great area for walking, cycling, and taking out the pooches. Wonderful view of the St- Lawrence River, rapids, natural fauna to observe, and just enjoying nature at its best, close to downtown Montreal"
Not too good a little price

"Very peaceful and relaxing, a beautiful scenery"
"In this location you can get great pictures. You can bring your kids, take pictures of birds, sunrise and sunset. Also this is a bird sanctuary. It's beautiful.
Photographers like this place for wedding photography.
If you're a photographer you need to check this park.
You can take walks here and run. The best times are sunrises and sunsets to visit this location."
"Enjoyed a peaceful walk
Along the trees, listened to the Rapids to helped break the monotony of boredom"
So relaxing especially in the morning. I am a photographer and I go here at least once a week to take photos of birds.
Very relaxing by the waterfront
"I went there really often in my life, it is a beautiful peace of nature in our way too urban montreal, BUT if like me you like to relax in a smoke free environment this is not the place, people smoke marijuana and cigarettes and so the place smells bad."
Its nice there i a bird sanctuary there lots of bird and geese. Looks nice next to rapids.
"The park is very nice, and has some nice fauna and flora.
And even though it is a lovely place, it is only for a walk or a picnic, not much else to do.
And, unfortunately, it is not a safe place because anyone can fall into the rapids."
Scenic place for a picnic day
"If you are a bird-lover, this park is a must-go since it is Montreal's migratory bird sanctuary, where you can find 225 different species of birds. You can also ride your bike, or just jog along the St. Lawrence River. Parking is free in the parking lot and on the street."
The most beautiful park in Canada with a great ambience of st Lawrence river.
Superb place for nature lovers
So serene. I saw 8 great blue herron. The rapids we amazing.
River is at arms distance. The flow and pace of rapids is both exhilarting and frightening
Best place in montreal
Piece full and Calm.
"i like to go smoke weed there , scince canabis is legal in canada,quebec ."
"Beautiful for picnic, small gatherings"
Very icy pathways
Love it
"Very nice open park with lots of open space. There is also a üê¶ sanctuary in the back with a nice view of the rapids which I was quite surprised to see as I was not aware that it existed. The bike path also makes it easily accessible and there is even a Bixi station, the last one going west so an easy bike to the metro."
Montreal - The land of the wonders! In the middle of the city it's pop up from nowhere amazing island where the time stops clicking!

"Very beautiful relaxing you may have pik nik, fish sun bath."
visiting family here ! loved it Alot !
"Quite liked the place, though it was way too hot and humid on the day when we visited. It wasn't very busy and part of the park was closed off.

The water looked a bit too dangerous to kayak in and we didn't see anyone in the parts with strongest current, though there were a few people further down the river, so they may have gone through the rapids."
Need a flotation device to fish from the shore...
Feel the power of the water with amazing natural areas
Breathtakingly soothing to the soul... Need to go there just once to get hooked like i am..
Nice place to fish or just hang out with the family.
Awesome spot in the city where u forget ur still in the city

Great packrafting and amazing bird life.
It has a spectacular scenery recommended for all of you
Spectacular park 45 minutes from downtown Montreal but easily accessible with public transportation. Take the metro to the de l'eglise station then bus 58 West. The sound of the water of the rapids is worth the trip. It made me think of adventure films.
Beautiful

Make sure you bring a GAS bbq."

Good for picnic and also to propose at night
Really good small park with no bicycles or dogs allowed.. excellent view of the rapids.

Nice park along the river with a sanctuary for birds

Such a beautiful view

Naturally mediative."
Beautiful place.

Excelente mantenimiento de los jardines.

Muy tranquilo y muy adecuando para un d√≠a de campo."
"Un merveilleux endroit calme en pleine nature des beau sentier a march√© et voir la nature
Je recommande fortement."
"C'est un incontournable un endroit de tranquillit√© o√π l'on peut voir les oiseaux
Les rapides sont de toute beaut√©"
J'ai toujours aim√© me promener dans ce sentier..de plus en plus beau
Beautiful big park where every day there's people enjoying life and all sorts of activities.
"Beautiful park, clean and fresh air all around it. I wish there were signs in English too a little difficult as I do not speak French. Also I wish people should not smoke in the park."
"This is the biggest park I've been so far in Montreal. It has a water with beautiful ducks playing in it and benches to sit next to them. The place is huge, with courts for tennis, and other sport activities. I live this place. I've heard people express their joy about this place, and I was impressed to experience it. Definitely going there from time to time"
This park is beautiful. My favourite place to sit and get some sun on a lazy Saturday afternoon. There is some construction this year so the fountain is not on and the lake around it is drained but there are duckies on the other side.
Extremely powerful. This Parc has immense energetic properties. A good place for those trying to connect with the cosmic web ü§ç
Just beautiful and has everything.  Even bike training space :) ice-cream shop is just next to it
One of the most beautiful parks in the city. Great outdoor space.
"It's an amazing park, you have available tables or you can sit in the grass during summer, make BBQs, walk your dogs and many more"
"Great park, lots of green space to bring a blanket and have a BBQ. Currently, there is construction ongoing on the amphitheatre."
"One of my favorites parks in Montreal, the small lake has a good effect specially on sunny day.
Beautiful atmosphere and i notice that lot of young people here, and less families."
"A beautiful place to just sit and relax, in the heart of the city. It's really beautiful during the autumn season with lot of benches and cozy grass sit on. The lake is very peaceful in the summer with ducks floating around. It becomes an ice rink in winter. During summer and fall, there are lots of bixi stands around the park. Also you won't have trouble finding a parking spot. For those who prefer metro Sherbrooke is the closest."
"Kinda crumby under construction area, but mostly calm and relaxing park. Good shade options and traffic separation."
Nice green space in the heart of downtown.  Mostly well maintained but looks like there is some construction going on by the lookout.
"La Fontaine Park presents a gorgeous snowy scene to us in winter.

Snow is the gift that winter gives us. Not only our human being, but also all living things embrace snow, like these trees in the Park. Snow make them graceful. They are dancing in the wind."
"Awesome Park, Very Well Designed and Well Maintained!!"
"The second park in town, its‚Äô vibe is certainly different season by season, and the weather certainly plays a role in whether this place is traversable or not, but it‚Äôs good for a picnic or a walk around, and there are bathrooms that aren‚Äôt terrible. The ducks really make the place for me. Unfortunately they aren‚Äôt a permanent fixture of this spot."
It's one of the most famous parks in Montreal. Very lively....have some wonderful eateries near the park.
"Great experience. Security is not the best someties, but I love the place"
"This park is amazing all in one.
Picnic benches, sports and exercise areas, small pond, dog park. :)
Just go and do what you want."
"A great park to expend time with your family and friends, it has a beautiful artificial lake and plenty of space to room around"
La fontaine parc.was.exceptional  the most amazing part was the middle aged asian man picking up cans and telling ua interesting background stories very wholesome 10 out of 10 would recommend
It is one of the greatest parc i'v been. The only reason why i did put 4stars was because  it was really crowded because of its popularity.
Picnic vibes. Fun place to be. Can't wait until summer!
"Great park for picnics and out door activities (jogging, biking & walking) ideal for families."
"Beautiful park especially when the pond is filled with water. Plenty of green space as well as recreational areas (tennis courts, soccer pitch, bocce ball, etc.)"
"Very nice spot, many restaurants nearby. During the winter, the ice is really nice and the space for skating is really big also since the body of water is frozen around that time."
Great park! It's possible to do skating in winter there.
Great place to hangout with friends. Grab a beer and a Frisbee for a good time.
Is packed but respectfully spaced out and the weather is perfect...COME ON DOWN
"The place is calm and when the sun comes up, it is magnificent."
"Structures are old and not maintained very well,  and looks like they only clean it weekdays as trash everywhere and trash cans overfill  .."
"Nice park, lake and playground for all ages. Great for a picnic"
"Ice skating on the pond is great!
The rental shop is closed for lockdown - but the ice is still maintained regularly."
"My favorite park in Montreal, although I was wish was bigger but that's only an issue in summer. So crowded on weekends"
"Here is another very cool lake in the center of Montreal. We hit this one on the way out of town. There was no problem parking and getting access to the park.

There is a large lake and many pathways to wander around. They have a large number of benches and grassy areas to sit and enjoy the tranquility. It makes you forget you are in a big city."
Lafontaine park is a large enough park that you can really enjoy strolling around quite a large distance. You can always find a socially distant place to sit and relax.
Beautiful park with pleasant ambience..nice peaceful place to hangout with friends and family
Awesome place! One of the Best Park in Montr√©alüòç
"A great walk, a beautiful view, from which I am in favor of limiting buildings to increase that height."
Middle of downtown and full of people.  Not enough benches.  Avoid if you can and drive to a better park.
Loke the place.  a lot of people playing.  it is a fun place to be
"Exactly what you'd expect: a park with numerous park-like features. Lots of characters and wierd people, a bit of a Westworld MTL edition vibe. Great park simulation, I give it a 5/7"
I enjoyed every bit of my time there.
Currently under construction but still a really nice place to sit and have a picnic!
"Very spacious, very nice spot for nature and always busy now."
Beautiful Montreal park with ponds and lovely trees and peaceful spots to sit on a blanket with a friend or loved one. Not overly populated and lots of different little pockets for all kinds of park lovers.
"Beautiful trees, much flowers, clean table available for lunch."
"THE parc in Montr√©al to have a typical Montr√©alers evening, best place to hangout and have a relax time while watching ducks and enjoying a good stroll around"
Amazing place to be with friends.. Family.. Love ones
There is a beautiful lake and great playground.
"Beautiful in the summer, magical in the winter. I love coming here."
"One of the greatest larks in mtl, with tenis cours, dog parks and great views, it lacks a few tables and as such, they are taken nost of the time."
Awesome you can bring your BBQ  anytime in the Park üòâüëç
It was nice and a great place to relax after a long week.
"Great parc with a calming atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great place to hang out with some friends, read a book, and play in the snow during winter."
Very nice place to hangout with family and friends. It has a baseball field and 2 volleyball fields.
"Great park, lots of trails and spaces to explore. Try to go there by bike or public transport to avoid parking spot hassles!"
Great place to spend a nice cosy sunny day. A lot of activities going on. You can join any group and can have fun. There is a lake in the middle of the park where you can often spot ducklings. Don't forget to take Frisbee or volleyball with you!
"Nice, big, cozy and full of people with enough space to be at least 2m from everyone"
"a must go. especially on a sunny day.
my only wish is bike rentals :-(
definitely worthwile and easy to get to."
Very calm place to get some fresh air. Nice lake with pubble on the bottom. Lots of nature in a fast pace city like Montreal. Several walkways to enjoy with your toddler. Well managed park.
Good place to have a picnic
Great place to spend some time with family. Kids will definitely enjoy this place. You could easily spend about 3 hours here provided if the weather permits.
"Beautiful park in the heart of Montreal! Its beauty is at its peak in Autumn, but a great place to take in greenery any time of the year."
It was very nice and relaxing !! Enjoyed the really nice weather and sun üåû ~
It has a good multi player tennis court
"Super nice lake summer or winter, you can easily pass half day here on the lawn with the sun."
Loved it. Something for everyone to do. Loved the different areas and the water bodies. Enjoy the ducks!
"This is a beautiful park. There's plenty to see and do here. Lots of benches, trees, paths, and more. There's a large pond in the park that's worth walking around. La Fontaine Park was the last place I visited during my weekend in Montreal on Canada Day weekend and it was a fantastic way to cap it off."
One of the best places to enjoy outdoor skating in Montreal. Go early as it gets crowded.
"Great time ice skating with my work family, it's a nice park and very open."
"Love this place! A enough-sized green park where you can go to do whatever you want from taking the sun, have a meal with your mates or why not  play different kind of games. Lovely sunsets and  breathtaking views."
"That park really has some views. I must confess that even after 18 months that I visited it I can't stop thinking about it.

I know that many would say that Parc La Fontaine is like any other park but for me is really special.

I would love to spend every second of my weekend reading alongside the small pond within it.

God i miss Montreal"
Easy parking and nice park. Will go again.
Very nice place to walk and take the kids to play
Beautiful place. Be relax and take deep breath. Enjoy the natural beauty.
"I‚Äôve lived next to this park for 3 years and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favourite in Montreal.

SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy."
Beautiful in winter as in all seasons. Watching kids and adults skating and tobogganing. Magical!
"It has everything you need from a park, playground, a lake, although the lake is dried out. It's beautiful park in the heart of Plateau-Mont-Royal."
"One of the best parks I have ever been to. There is a beautiful lake, a lot of wildlife, including the biggest amount of squirrels I have ever seen, ducks, seagulls and pigeons. A lot of green spaces where you can just lay down and enjoy life, many available sports to do, benches, statues and even a big dog park. You can see a lot of people doing the most diverse activities in this park, from running to playing music instruments. I definitely recommend that you come here."
Awesome place to go skating with a big ice surface. Skate rental available aswell!
What a great Oasis in the city. You can truly get away from it all in this park. The fountain is wonderful with all the ducks. This park has something for everyone. My only complaint are the homeless people but that is hard to control unless you want cops all around.
Fountain park with a fountain that never seems to be functional... Hahaha classic.
Very nice place for skating....Price is adorable and crowd is good.
Quite crowded at the moment but easy to find a spot where u r at least 2-3 meters away from everyone
Great parc to hang out or picnik in. Do not recommend swimming in the fountain however.
A very nice large park surrounded by lotsa good restaurants. The large pond is completely by ducks! And there's plenty of savage squirrels looking through the trash for leftover bits of delicious poutine. #duckcentral
It's good to relax and enjoy the nature
I live nearby and walk there most days.  It's such a pleasant environment and it's nice to see the changing seasons.
"This park is amazing all the time.
I love it"
Very nice place
"Beautiful scenery, great location, lots of very friendly people. It's a great place to go and throw a frisbee, have a picnic, or play some sports"

There is many places to do any activities such skateboard, play soccer, playüéæ , or basketball even baseball. It's clean"
Nice place but still lots of snow and not very clean
Beautiful park with available parking around.
"Very nice Park, but a lot of people!"
It is a beautiful park. It is great for running or walking with the family.
Nice park to visit. You have a small restaurant in the middle of the park. You have a wonderful view to the small lake. I recommend.
It's my go-to suntanning and chilling place.  Don't forget the hidden sangrea backpack cache.
"Located at the foot of Mount Royal, from which Montr√©al is named, is the neighborhood of Le Plateau-Mont Royal.  Accessible via the Orange line at the Mont Royal stop, the neighborhood is charming and features flower and fruit stands, galleries, restaurants, pubs and shops. t's the perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon, enjoying excellent brunches, outdoor seating and people-watching."
"The park is a beautiful place to just sit and relax, even for a moment. It's especially beautiful during the autumn season. There are even ducks that like to visit, for those who like to watch them."
"Amazing spot for families and friends to meet, restrictions applied  following the Covid19  public health guide lines put in place by the health Ministry of Qu√©bec.  Stay safe"
Beautiful pond with a fountain and a little waterfall. Lots of seating by the pond. One of the many beautiful parks in montreal.
"Beautiful park, with many opportunities for sport, kids playgrounds, kids bikepaths, fun and relax. Great place to spend a few hours or even the entire day. I particularly enjoyed the music from an original artist, who created an amazing relaxing atmosphere."

I went skating but it was nice very not busy in the morning
A beautiful and calm place to spend time with family and friends. Good place for walking. Cycling road around the pond is not good enough.
"Big, clean, and has many nice amenities"
"On of the best parks in Montreal. Each are of the park has its own vibe: there's the picnic area, hippie area, cirque area, musicians area, and more. Beautiful place to spend a weekend and relax before summer ends"

A nice big park in the middle of the city you'll probably see duck swimming in the water.
Very pretty. Lots of green space for picnic and walking/biking paths. We usually pick up food from one of the many nearby restaurants and enjoy in the park.
"Very cool place in the middle of the eastern side of Montreal downtown. In General, it‚Äôs very busy. In the winter, there‚Äôs a nice ice rink to try."
I'm taking walks in La Fontaine Park almost daily. There are lots of activities too (for example Tai Chi during summer and ice skating during winter time). Lots of Bixi stations around the park. They have a lake (ducks are cute with their babies ü¶Üü¶Ü). Also they have a restaurant there. A nice place to explore and enjoy.
A wonderful park at the heart of Montreal a lot of people are enjoying a bit of fresh air  here in this park particularly in this pandemic time
"This is a casual, laid back park. There's plenty of greenery, fountains, a pond, and walk and cycle ways that make this a really worthwhile park to visit.

There are different sections that let you play sports, cycle, jog, have a picnic, or just sit back and enjoy.  A perfect place to come when the weather is good and soak up the sun or lay under a tree. Given the different sections, you can choose to be amongst the other park-goers or find a quieter section to yourself."
"Beautiful park. At some point the pond was not filled and it was a little dirty, but they filled it up and it is definitely the prettiest park near downtown Montreal. Beautiful river / lake that you can skate on in the winter. The restaurant seems lovely with nice view on the lake."
It's like Montreal's own central park
Nice paths for taking a stroll.  Skating is available on the rinks and artificial lake.
"The park all covered in white is just amazing. Beautiful landscapes, a giant ice skating rink above the frozen lake. Great place to spend a funny afternoon in the winter."

"Parc la Fontaine is a very beautiful park to be at. Extremely big with the beauty of the snow and lots and lots of people enjoying the skating rink. Was a nice way to spend Valentine day despite the espace was closed.
Had an extremely nice time here"
Great playgrounds for younger and older kids
Beautiful nature in a concrete jungle
"Very Nice place to live by ! During spring, summer and fall they host free cultural activities such as movie screening, concert, exhibitions... there's even a theatre at the center of the park."
This is one of the best parks in the city. Amazing place to spend time surrounded by nature and beauty.
Beautiful place to visit in Summer and as well as in winter
Every angle of this place looks good. It should be easy to get into a positive vibe here with such a nice view.
Nice and calm. The early September air was crisp and rather chilly for a late summer evening. Heartening to see a lot of folks being active on a weekday. It was a bit early for the music to kick in the park else I would have hung around a bit more.
"A beautiful park to jog, have a picinic, relax and read books."
Great park. Really big with lots of space and a nice water feature. Places are close to get food and drinks also. For sure a good place to bike to and hang out.

"That place is phenomenal, very good to ride a bike and also to go  for a slow walk."
This park in awesome.
"Nice and quiet park for walk or run
But the best part is Squirrels"
"A beautiful large park of a block size at the corner  Sherbrooke and Papineau Sts and where you can take a sun tan, jog, walk your dog, play tennis volleyball or have a simple picnic. It's a shame that responsible people let it run down: lots of cut floating weed on the water, big hole or uprise on road asphalt around lake, accumulated dirt on corners, deteriorated cement steps covered with dirt and weeds...."
"Beatifull big park to enjoy some nature in the city. There is a lake with ducks, many trees and squirrels everywhere. There are many places to sit, make a picnic ride bikes, etc. There are also sports areas."
"Gotta love beautiful spaces in the middle of a fabulous, busy urban centre. Montr√©al love!"
"Parc Lafontaine is one of the most popular urban parks in the center of Montreal. Its geographical location, not far from the Plateau du Mont Royal, ensures that it will always have a steady flow of revelers. Many families come here to picnic, for a walk around its artificial lake or take a nap in the shade of many of its majestic trees."
Beautiful park suitable for all the family. If you look closely in the pond you‚Äôll see small crustaceans.
Nice place to relax with some ducks and pigeons around..there is a large pond with a small waterfall. There is some construction seen inside but there are many parts of the park where you can have your own time to have a quiet evening
"Great place to run and walk n relax. Although surrounded by busy roads, the park is peaceful n quiet. Even as a dog park. And there is a nice lake with a beautiful fountain."

Originally conceived as Logan Park and opened in 1878 by the Federal Government in Ottawa, the Park name changed in 1947 to better reflect the population of the time. Given as a gift  to the City of Montreal 1990."
"Nice park! It was clearly a local favorite as it was bustling with people from those playing sports, picnicking, and a local festival with a stage. The only issue was not alot of parking nearby and paid parking."
"Nice place for jogging and walking or spending the weekend in. There is a big lake surrounded by fields and benches where buskers perform and people picnic on, as well as a small community centre with art workshops and  access of bathrooms."
Nice place to relax.  Maybe sit by the water and read a book or listen to music...... meet friends and relax on the grass. Great place for it all
So relaxing place quite place clean Park You have a lot of attraction to do I love this place! üòçü§©
"Awesome park, needs help though"
"What a lovely place to have a picnic! So many trees to sit under, and a little kept pond to walk around! Theres a little mini waterfall thats just precious as well.
The squirrels ARE brave and WILL eat out of your hand if attempted. Be weary."
"La Fontaine is one of the largest and most interesting parks in the heart of Montreal. Situated in the Plateau and a short walk from down town, this park is the perfect place to come to cool down beneath the trees on a hot summer's day or warm up while ice skating on a cold winter's evening. La Fontaine has something for everyone - ample space to picnic, beautiful views and luscious gardens to chill in, numerous sports courts (tennis, p√©tanque, volleyball..) and a caf√© by the lake. You won't be disappointed!"
Beautiful park with lots of trails and seating areas!
"This is the hottest club in Montreal during the pandemic. It's got fresh air, trees, p√©tanque and lots of space. You can even bring a friend!"
"Amazing that such an oasis exists in the city. It's a little dated, and the lawns are mostly weeds, but still a green area where people can relax and enjoy nature."
"Beautiful park with a nice lake in the middle - lots of ducks, loons, and herons üëç romantic and serene"
Very nice place to chill with friends
My favorite parc!
The beauty and splendor! Sereen and great for meditation.
We had a good walk around this very attractive park. The only downside was the toilet facilities which were not well maintained. The lake is beautiful with plenty of seating.
"My go to place to chill, workout, play."
Beautiful park with great vibes. Plenty of people chilling out over drinks and a BBQ picnic or simply coming to read. A must see in autumn!
It's a nice park but lots of weird people
Great weather today...
Pleasant park and a nice  lake with ducks situated in centre of Montreal where you can sit by the water by reading book or having fun with family . A walk in the park for while calms your mind . very good for a walk and rent a bike to go around
Great place to walk or x country skiing
It is the same architect who designed Central Park in New York so Yes guys! You should totally stop by and see for yourself! Great park üòç‚ú®
"It was written that us a perfect place for bbq. But as a first visitor, I found it a mess. It was a bbq every where as well as interdiction sign. Very confused and unsatisfy."
Nice park for a walk or to bike around. plenty of place to have a picnic. Clean and safe.
Very nice park.  Very well laid out with an excellent skating rink that is winding through the park and makes for a very nice afternoon event.  There are buildings in which to rent skates and other Winter items to enjoy the park in whole.  Warm beverages are available to keep warm with a nice friendly atmosphere to socialize. If you like Winter sports this is a must visit place when in Montreal.
"Surely one of the most pleasant parks in Montreal. Enjoy a light stroll around the water, sit in the lawn to read a book or stop by to eat a delicious poutine from nearby Banquise"
A perfect park for refreshment
My favourite place to visit all year round.
Beautiful parc in the heart of the city. During winter it's worth it for ice skating with classical music.
"A great place to go! Beautiful landscape, lots of activities. If you want hiking, jogging, relaxing, this is your place!"
Beautiful park and pond. Reminds me of New York's central park but very tiny version.
"Nice park, large enough,  yet it can get super crouded sometimes."
Lovely place to bring a picnic and a bottle of vino on a summer afternoon. Quiet and romantic. Great date location.
Love this park!
Super busy during weekends but definitely the best place to skate in Montreal
Nice big park to walk around in. People seem to be keeping distance and staying within their own groups. Nice big pond with plenty of seating
Pretty much my favorite place to hang out in the entire city.
"Romantic, natural splendor, a haven of peaceful & delightful charm and makes you forget the hustle and bustle of the city around you."
In love with this park...its near my place so I am always walking around there or just hanging around soaking in the sun in the summer.
"If you come to Montreal is autumn in October, you must come to this park to take a look at the beautiful autumn scenery."
Corn ta-das for. You
"Very nice park if you wanna chill with friends or walk around. Very clean, however it can get a little bit crowded. If you are a begginer runner its perfect because is very flat. ü§óü§óü§óü§ó"
Outstanding view and scenery! Would recommend walking about the park to fully grasp the parks beautiful landscapes.
"La Fontaine Park is a beautiful mature park with lots of old hardwood trees, ponds, gardens and more.  A welcome reprieve for many locals year round, but especially during the dog days of summer. A chunk of nature in the heart of the city."
Great and very peaceful place for reading book or listening musics.
"Two types of Tennis courts, plenty of room if you reserve in advance"
In the middle of the island. Good place to spend time. Also has an outdoor pool.
I love the nature but the fountain was closed for construction
"For me, this is one of the most awesome park in all MTL. This is a must ! There is a book called ""La grosse femme d'√† c√¥t√© est en ceinte"", and they talk about the neighborhood  and how the little kids from 1945 gone here to spend their time. Very romantic ! You won't forget its charm."
"It's a big park, go check it out."
Refreshingly young demographic. Seems like a good place for just about anything outdoors
Best park ever.
Great park. A lot of green space with bike route. Near two Bixi stations. You can rest under the trees near the lake inside the park.
Nice.
"Place of positive vibes: great place to mingle and share a glass ""du bier"". Lots of students, artistic souls, politically engaged debates. In short, a must visit place of Montrealaise French speaking community"
"It's a beautiful park, albeit tiny, and I love that it exists! Interestingly, I've seen some people swimming with the ducks on a rainy summer night."
Very big park
The Best park in town where your meet people and you practice a lot of sports for free but its hard to park your car.
"The park is wonderfully designed. Personally, I found it very attractive and realxing. You can enjoy a lot of fun and you got plenty of space to do sports also üòÅ"
"Nice place to stay at night :)
The ice looks good, have to get there with some stuff to ice skate :)"
Lovely large urban park with a pond. Large evening gatherings of locals make this a great hang out.
A very nice place especially in sunny days.
I'm born and raised in Vancouver and to have a parc of this magnitude at my doorstep now in Montreal makes it all that much easier to live here. Phenomenal energy.
One of the best parks in Montreal
"Definitely a nice park to walk in.  Looking for a place to free yourself from negativity, a walk in the park will truly clear up your mind.  Feel the love!"
I love üíï
"Bring a blanket, wine and your favorite meal to spend a lazy afternoon by the water, keeping cool under the trees in summer or  take in the gorgeous autumn colors during sweater-wearing season in the Fall. Huge park to leisurly stroll along the paths and you can even stop and play a bit of petanque if the mood fits ;)"
Great park! Fantastic atmosphere
"Enjoyed our afternoon there. Quite reviving and lively park. Nice playground for the kids, if you have any."
Place to be you got the water you can bring your kids have a lot of space to got place for your bike have a picnic I have a strictly recommend people to come at La Fontaine Park you got tennis and everything so come on down guys and don't forget to wear your mask thank you
"Squirrels home üòç A good place to have lunch, to take a nap or to walk with your dogo üêï"
"It was alright, but I come from out of country and am use to many more parks and water fronts. Although this park was a neat little place, it wasn't what I was looking for."
"First time there, social distance get together. Definitely going back and will bring a portable bbq."
Nice place to relax
Very nice place near to me
"What a nice place to spend an evening for a quiet little birthday! This is the second option for me to go for my run, the lake and the ducks are a sight and a nice place to relax. I saw people sitting, chilling and reading some books which is definitely you should do if you end up going there. In winters you would end up going there from some sledging and just enjoy the pristine white Montreal snow."
Beautiful place for a nice quiet walk!
Nice parc with amazing green view. It's good fot sports and relax as well.
"Beautiful park, very big, there's always lots of people when the weather  is nice but it's easy to find a nice spot. Lots of good eats nearby too."
Best park in Montreal. Very large and family friendly
"Lovely park, never too crowded even on the nicest days. Don't forget to watch for people when you're cycling though."
Beautiful park in the heart of montreal! Needs the water back in the lake buy other then that love it. In this times definitely recommend.
I had such a great time.
"An amazing local park in Le Plateau Mont Royale for a picnic, renting a bike or just enjoying the view by the ponds."
"A beautiful park with plenty of space for everyone to enjoy. Plenty of ducks and squirrels to watch play. There's a big pond in the middle to look over in bliss. Not over crowded ( mid day Friday) and few children made it nice and quiet. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place to read a book, meditate, or just watch life go by."
"Great park, bike , walk , unwind after a tough day. Anything is possible."
"living nearby, so this park is very convenient for my dogwalks...very vibrant and lively, with people doing any kind of sports activities to kid camp's outings, this park offers a little observation point into life of its inhabitants"
Busy but beautiful
One of the many lovely green spaces in Montreal. Great for a picnic or a simple walk.
"It is one of the most beautiful and peaceful parks Montreal has to offer. I love going there for chilling, running, having a picnic with friends, etc."
Loved the park. Perfect for a gathering for special occasions. Lots of benches for bbq and party.
"It's a big park in the middle of the city. I spent lots of time reading, doing picnic there in the summertime. It's really cool. Friends used to do BBQ, and now, during winter, it's beautiful in another way, and lots of people go ice skating."
"Great location, diverse community... well maintained"
"What a nice place.
Beautiful manicured skating surface in a quiet and quaint Montreal suburb.
Lots of boutiques and small shops around depicting the history, charm and culture of this wonderful historic city."

"Great place to go on a sunny sunday. Bring friends, board games and food and it makes for a wonderful picnic."
great skating rink for everyone
Beautiful park
My favorite park by far!
Moved here from Vancouver BC 6 weeks ago and it's the most beautiful place. The rad people make it so electric. Montreal people are so dope and positive. Best place to walk my dog and meet fellow muscians. Fav place in  Montreal to relax and zen out
Always fun. Lots of squirrels
"Lovely park, ideal to go with friends and/or family. It's really nice, especially with the lake and tons of places where one can do picnic."
"It is among my favorite parks in Montreal. It is beautiful, urban, with great views and nature and has a nice bistro. A must go in a sunny day in Montreal!"
This Park is big with a beautiful landscape. People can sit around the Lake and relax
Dirty ..But you can see cute squirrels
You can not have a better natural habitat accessible within the city! Large area. Velo permitted. Children paradise. A small kingdom for ecureils including a few rare white ones. At times music players!  A view on the artificial water pond.just sit or lay down and relax! Surrounding areas have drinks and food if needed and you can bring at walking distance.smell the 4 seasons and the fresh air. Voila!
Nice park‚Äî well maintained and easy-to-follow paths.
it's beautifull
No parking lol
"Still one of the best place to hang out with your group of friends to eat, to plan a BBQ in familly or to just take a nap after smoking a blunt under the trees in the mid afternoon :)"
"It's a large beautiful park with lots of playgrounds.
Pros:
BBQ allowed
There are 2 lakes and many ducks
Safe
Nice people
Clean public toilets with soap

Cons:
Limited picnic tables
Parking is a major problem (average 5 hours 15$)
Grass level: 6/10"
"Simply good
You feel like not being in the city"
Very nice park with open spaces and a beautiful lake
This is my favourite park in all of Montreal it reminds me of Central park in New York
"I love this place just for go, take a sit and relax. It's beautiful!"
My favourite park in Montreal by far! Very peaceful and relaxing
Nice place for chill in the grass in the summer or for ice skating in the winter.
Always a pleasure chilling in this park. But weirdly enough they don't have a nearby water post to drink from safely unlike mont royal
"I love it so much. I have direct view from my building. It is amazing for picnics, to read a book, to draw. In summer there are festivals. Love it."
Cheerful and peaceful
One of the best park in Montreal with a european touch
"One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal! The trees are majestic, the place is well divided: children's games, water games, soccer fields, baseball, tennis, petanque, volleyball. There is also a dog park.  The ideal place for a picnic or a simple bike ride."
I do cardio poussette there. It is awesome
Great urban oasis. Bring a sandwich and a beverage and watch ducks play in the pond or squirrels scurrying around.
Wow. So nice.. so big. Clean  . Had a great time  . Beautiful park.
"Wonderful park filled with beautiful and happy people (specially in the summer) great for jogging, meditation, picnic, playing music..."
Little bit aglomerated for my taste...
Doge time !!! Love it
I love this place especially in the automne
"Beautiful parc, widespread with lots of places for social time. Bring your BBQ, your soccer ball or your frisbee and enjoy a fun time in the parc."
Not badüòú
Beautiful park
"This park is the first one I visited when I arrived in Montreal 33 years ago.  It went through a lot of good and bad times, nice and not so nice crowds but the spirit is still there.  It is a great place to hangout, to relax, to play many different sports with friends or simply sit down and enjoy a book or the scenery.  Ponds and waterfalls have been restore, fountains have multicolor LEDs, ducks can chase colored toe nails (just kidding).  It can sometimes be a bit like Woodstock since covid19 outbreak but hey, I don't know anyone complaining about that but the police.  LaFontaine Park is an oasis when heatwaves hit Montreal and everyone would miss it if disappeared.  That's it!  Now go."
"Nice relaxing park for a walk or run. If you don't like squirrels, avoid this place. There are so many here that you almost trip over them, it's fun to see them run around in the trees and play and stuff. They are cheeky though, if you leave your food unattended they will most likely try to steal some :)"
A friend of mine showed me around and we had a great time
"This park is really big with a great little pond and fountain. But it is falling a part in certain areas and needs a good repaving. Also, not really a safe spot for a nighttime stroll. Many drunks and my girlfriend and I were almost mugged... So there's that..."
"It was one of my daily visiting park...very beautiful, indeed!"
"Very nice park, you can easily spend 1-2 hours just walking around. If you get hungry grab a poutine at the corner."
"Great for picnics and to have a good time with family, friends or just by yourself"
"It's gorgeous!!! I loved this park! Definitely a perfect place To have a picnic, to enjoy  doing nothing  , outdoor games or whatever you want! I am sure that is a wonderful place to go  in Montreal! Lots of green and shaded spaces and a lake! What a wonderful surprise!!!!"
Nice ambiance lots of people doing there own thing..
"Probably the greatest park in Montreal. Gripping up next to it was just awesome, summer and winter."
Great park! Was designed by the same person who designed central park in New York!
Once i met a an old guy in a wheel chair and he was a really cool guy... but then i met this other guy in a wheel chair who was also a really cool dude... so i decided to get the 2guys together and see if we could meet up in the park... good times
"Very nice park, lots if room for everyone and amenities to have fun."
Great place if you wanna relax by the water/meditate or just run and exercise on the stairs and you can bring your dog too.
Love place
Chill park. A lot of police monitoring. Nice facilities
"Go here ofter to play beach volley, nice park, good to escape the city life a bit :)"
"Great park, really big, lots of benches, tables, fountains, a lot of trails, all open -lot of trees , no scruffy forest ,lake in the middle, lots of cool people, guitar players, excellent park"
"I absolutely love this park! It's a pefect spot to bring a friend or a lover to spend some quality time together, or simply bring your book and have good time with yourself... and as part of the scenario there are trees, squirrels, people dancing, meditating, practicing sports, kids running around... damn, it's a little relaxing paradise in the middle of the frenetic streets of Montr√©al!
It was during a sunny Summer day

J'ai h√¢te que l'√©t√© prochain vienne nous d√©tendre au parc La Fontaine üíö"
"Best park in Montreal-- Ducks,gerridae and tadpoles are awesome."
"Such a big beautiful park, they welcome picnics and family BBQ right in the heart of the city"
Great park with lots of space and options.
Very good and big park in Montreal! I love it ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Beautiful walking paths. Lake with ducks. Clean washrooms, Covid friendly."
Beautiful park
It was a nice time! I love that park!
Excellent place to be with the family . Enough room to accommodate a large group.
Not a good time to visit this park. Trees are bare and pond has just a little water in it. Probably would look better during summer.
"Absolutely great experience! Definitely a perfect place to hang out with family or friends during a nice day. There is a lot of green space and a mix of sunny and shaded areas depending on what you feel like. Great spot for a picnic, outdoor games, and a little day drinking :)"
Pleasant park with nice benches.
Very nice park in the hustle and bustle of the city.
Love this park.
"Lovely place
Quiet and cozy to smoke in peace"
"A great place for you to relax in and just chill. We went there and lay on the grass by the water to look up at the blue sky, the maple trees, and enjoy the breezes. We even saw a white squarrel!

A good place to people watch (haha), as many people come here to run or bike. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was how loud the EDM music was from a distance in the park. Is it even legal to blast out music in public like that?!"
"Beautiful parc, huuuuge and wonderful, love the squirrels everywhere and good for a dog walk"
"Really really nice park. Lots of seating, open spaces, hidden from the city hustle, pretty lake, sports areas... Good job Montreal. Please keep working hard to keep up the excellent parks!"
"A fairly large park, with a very pleasant lake section that takes up nearly a third of it."
"The park to visit accord to many, many Montrealers, including myself. There's no better place to spend a sunny afternoon with friends, family, amimal companions or all of the above! Bring a nice picnic meal and perhaps an alcoholic beverage or six and you're in for one unforgettable experience!"
It was very good be out again with some friends respecting the social distancing
It's one of my favorite parks. Its large but isn't full of fields for sports.. People come for picnics and for bike riding or running. It's a very chill park.. Also there are hawks there if you like bird watching.
Beautiful park!
Nice place to loose time et take fresh air
"This park has everything. There's a lot of trees and you can sit by the water. There's a field for soccer, baseball, volleyball, and basketball. There's picnic tables and benches. People bring hammocks and barbeques for picnics. You can bring you dog here but I think it has to stay on its leash, and there's trails for biking."
For such a big park they could have more water fountains as well as bathrooms. But overall it's a beautifull place to spend the day
"Very nice place to spend the day with the family when the weather is nice. U can barbecue, picnic and play"
"Large park downtown. Great open sunny spots by the water, picnic benches in the shade for bbq."
Awesome friendly parc great for picknick
Beautiful public park... lots of squirrels!
"Running, chilling or playing some music, the kind of park i like."
"V nice park even in the winter. They have a little cafe that serves hot drinks also. I have to say the coffee was a little American diner, been sitting around since morning tasting but nonetheless on a cold day it will do."
Gorgeous park but not sure why they still haven't filled up the pond
The city had abandoned the park. Shameful.
"Spacious, beautiful, historic"
Nice environment.
Love this park. Always colorful and full of nice people. Summer is best for a walk in the park.
Great park to go hang with friends and family or even on a date.
Beautiful . Serene and autumn colors are beautiful
Best place for family picnic all around the year. My favorite time is the fall and winter.
Went ice skating on  sunny Saturday afternoon.  Lovely location on pond however  walk from change room to ice is treacherous.  Fell down on way out.  My companion fell on way off ice and broke her arm.  Staff  were indifferent.  On bright side  care at Notre Dame hospital was good
Here you can find lots of photos opportunities. This park is beautiful in any season. Summer time you can see shows and activities. You can bring your kids and have fun. It's a really popular park here in Montreal. The landscape is beautiful. A nice place to relax.
Great hidden gem in the heart of the plateau. Perfect for jogging running on hot days because of the good tree cover. A loop around the park is approximately 2.7km.
Good place to run or play group sports
Greatest Park in Montreal!
"If you're a local, tourist it doesn't matter since everyone comes here to enjoy a little bit of nature in the middle of the city. Having an amazing Portuguese chicken place and one of the best poutines in Montreal makes the area even better. It's a definite good place to come visit when in Montreal or even to just sit around during the weekend with friends, a loved one or your dog."
Very scenic location during the summer and a nice ice rink during the winter.
"A large, shady park, popular with young and old, dog walkers, runners, cyclists, tennis players and sunbathers--an urban oasis."
The ducks were engaging.ü¶Ü
beautiful park and peaceful
Beautiful place close to Sherbrooke metro station
Very nice place. Hard to find a spot to park.
"Amazing park with a lake! Seat, speak and relax!"
"A beautiful park in the middle of the Plateau. Large enough for your morning runs, it's a great place to picnic, practice yoga or read on your own."
"I've the opportunity to be on open air yoga class there was pure energy,  definitely one of my favourites parks."
"When of the best parks in summer and winter.
They have ice skating and a big playground during summer. BBQ area and tennis courts.
Walking around the park and jogging on the path, you discover hidden secrets..."
Nice park! Went there with My patnais twice already and got nothing bad to say about it!
"Nice park to see, enjoy the fresh air"
"Wide park, softball everyday, p√©tanque, volleyball, small off-leash dog park...
Nice spot for hammocks? In the pine trees by the water! Your hammock neighbors won't be too close but you can also create a small hammock gathering with your friends!"
Nice tons of room to keep a proper distancing
"Clean, big spaces. Not enough sanitary blocks"
Huge park. There is places to play volleyball and basket. You can come with your bike
"Beautiful place! In the winter, the river freezes over and there are many families partaking in different winter sports!"
"Good for enjoing time with family, usually cowded"
The grass is sparse leaving lots of dirt and mud patches. Still a nice place to go for an afternoon. One thing the parks could use more of are public grills.
"I visit the Parc La Fontaine during a sunny say in the autumn and it was one of the most beautiful view I have ever had in my entire life. The yellow leaves on the ground and hanging on the trees, the sun making everything even more yellow, the ducks, the walking dogs and their owners... It was really good. I was needing a touch with nature and I had a blast that afternoon. Highly recommend."
Great to bring some drinks with friends. Have a picnic and run and cycle! It also has a train for young kids. Bring extra diapers for the kids.
I saw pictures of the park from fall and it they looked breathtaking. Maybe its the time of the year that makes the difference. I took the metro to the place and the experience was ok. Its end of August and there was a light drizzle. The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.
"La Fontaine Park was absolutely lovely and so beautiful!

I spent an afternoon relaxing and walking around this gorgeous urban green space and had a great time. There were two manmade ponds, lots of walking paths and benches, and areas to picnic, suntan and relax. The park had plenty of mature trees and was a really pleasant place to spend time.

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful place to relax and enjoy nature within the city. It was a great place to walk and relax."
"Little heaven in the heart of Plateau MTL
I love this place"
"Beautiful park, but being the biggest park in one of the densest neighbourhoods in the country, it needs some TLC. Looking forward to the amphitheater opening back up, and maybe some repaving? Guys?"
I always like to spend time with my friends there not matter the weather or which day of the week !
"We stopped by just to skate, and were not disappointed! Deliciously thick and stable ice, ambient lighting, and just the right amount of people out.
Located nicely. Great spot to hang out!"
Lovely green-spot in the heart of the city.
"Great park to relax, have some food and drinks"
I love it
That is great place for families and individuals üòä
"Lovely park, squirrels come up to your."
One of the reasons why I love this city
"I really like this park as it has a lot to offer for everyone. Families and friends gather and they can just relax on the park, have a picnic and even play games. They also have a few courts to play, baseball, volleyball and more. I also find that in the warm summer weather, this location is quite cool that you can even sleep on the grass. One other perk is that it's close to popular restaurants if you're willing to line up."
Gorgeous üíó
Good place to go for a picnic or just a walk in the park.
Good place to drink a beer and eat a dessert üòÇ
Went there for a walk during the summer! I just love this park; so big and quiet!
The best place in town to do some slackline !
Beautiful big park. Lots of squirrels.
"What a wonderful surprise.  Stopped here to enjoy a park bench and a pop, and ended up staying for quite a while.  Beautiful fountain, boulevard of benches, and plenty of places for kids to play."
"The best park for walking, running, exercise, fun activities, barbecue. Best atmosphere in summer. And awesome view in fall."
"Serene, quiet park with a big pond. Had fun watching ducks, crows chasing squirrels."
Awesome summer hangout. People watch or simply relax. Skip the lineup at la Banquise and head straight up to Avenue Mont Royal for ice cream or a drink post-picnic.
Nice place to cycle and walk by the artificial lake!
Awesome üëå
Really beautiful park near lots of amenities.
"For an urban park this does So much fun work: picnic spaces, huge walking zones, multiple pickup sports & official sports areas, playground, popular summer music events. The dormant central amphitheatre is too bad, all locked off from access, but overall a wonderful and well used city park"
"Nice parc, has a lake and outdoor playgrounds and nice atmosphere"
Best park in the city
‚ù§
Beautiful park with lots of green space to enjoy
Peaceful
"This is one of my favorite parks in Montreal. It is a great place to sit down and relax, have a picnic, walk around, bring the little ones to play. It has never dissappointed me."
One of the Top 3 greatest public parks in Montreal. A must-see: our very own Central Park!
"Huge beautiful park everyone just doing their thing. Enjoy your wine with a nice picnic, have a BBQ, bring your kids, have a date. Everything is possible at this park, there's enough room and spots for everyone!"
Love it!
"A very beautiful place, I like it"
Wonderful place to take a promenade
Some ducks are a bit pushy for bread crumbs. Nice area though
"This is one of the nicest parks in the city, any time of the day your find a good atmosphere. Rather it's to play tennis/ baseball or a simple stroll this is Montreal's central park."
Nice
"Beautiful area for walking, bike riding and picnicking.  There's a kids playground on one side of the park that has something for little ones 3+.  Very family friendly"
A very big park for jogging running.. wait a fountain lake in it.. beautiful
Ice skating here was very fun. You can rent skates and then head to one of the portables to change your shoes. Getting on the ice was hard as there are no guardrails at a place that's not a rink. But all in all it was a very unique skating experience.
A good place to visit with friends and family
"It is one of my favorite park in Montreal.
Really nice water and landscapes."
Lot's of trails and a nice big pond with a large fountain to admire while you kick back and relax. Although there are signs indicating no booze it is totally ignored. In the evening we saw groups of people enjoying wine and other beverages . It's a great atmosphere and wonderful for people watching. Bring a blanket or some camp chairs and enjoy the view.
It is always nice to cool off under the trees. The groundskeepers must work hard to keep the park tidy and groomed.
"I walk through this park sometimes on my way to work. Really peaceful, but be carefull of the bikes"
"It‚Äôs a vibe out here for sure. Great for a jog, going on a walk with your significant other or just soaking in the Montreal culture. Whenever I visit Montreal I try to get a place near here. Downtown isn‚Äôt too far, AirBnb prices are reasonable, and there are great food options in walking distance."
"Located in the Plateau area at a walking distance from Mont Royal and Sherbrooke stations, this park has two ponds separated by a bridge and small waterfalls. It also has a nice fountain in the middle of one of the ponds. This charming park is a fabulous place to go for a run, play frisbee, have a picnic, or a romantic date. Very pretty area to go and see, would definitely recommend taking some time out to see it and take in the beauty. Truly relaxing, very difficult to believe this kind of nature and serenity can exist in the middle of a busy city."
Absolutely beautiful park that was definitely one of my favourite places I visited while in Montr√©al.
"Beautiful park, however, no restrooms nearby,THE CITY should put some extra, as well at Mont Royal."
Great to enjoy a laid back afternoon without being bothered. Lots of artists and students. I took a few naps there in warm days and it was very relaxing.
"Beautiful large park in the middle of the city. Spans several blocks. Walking paths, ponds, tennis courts, playgrounds. A great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city!"
Beautiful park but it needs to be fixed up a little. And put more security
Great place to take some creative pictures
It is a very lively park. You can see many you people from everywhere in the world.
"One of my favourite spots in Montreal. Easily accessible via public transit and there are lots of cool little things to check out. Bring some food, drinks, and a blanket and chill out for an hour - you won't regret it."
A great place to play soccer and meet some people from around the world!
Beautiful
Great place for families. The beach was excellent. Lifeguards were very alert.
Nice
It's nature in a big city
Very nice nature park in the middle of the city! Very good for running and any kind of activity ;)
"Nice big park with lots greenery, a lake, playgrounds, walking paths, benches, restaurant, short train rides (4$ pp), plenty of space for picnics but since it is on the Plateau, parking is scarce. 4 stars because last time we went there, the smell of weed just kept reoccurring over and over..."
Nice place to chill.
Whether you want to host a kid's birthday or you just want to spark one up and have some beer...this park manages to cater for everyone. It's really a microcosm of our society with picnic tables and a lot of greenery.
"Coming here is like stepping into an alternate dimension where people are at peace, every person of any color and gender are coexisting happily, and the nature is absolutely stunning. The squirrels will literally come hang out with you if you sit long enough. Super friendly people too!"
They have the most elaborate jungle gym for kids in the Plateau area and plenty of tables for adults to picnic at. Amazing place to spend a morning and afternoon. The fountain and pond is sure to keep your kids busy for a good while.
A nice park with a fountain and pond/pool sunken into the middle. The surrounding park and pathways are nice with lots of greenery in the summer.
Amazing beautiful parc in the middle of downtown
My favourite parc for leisure.
Nice park to stop for a break after hours of walking. You can grab some take away from the restaurants near by and enjoy on the grass
"Just skated here for the first time, can't wait to go back!"
Montreal's best urban park. Always lively! A great place to walk and talk or just people-watch. Nice little bistro in the heart of the park and cool occasional puppet shows and events.
"Beautiful park in the middle of the city that makes you forget you're in a city.  If you want to slow down and or get some fresh air, this is one of the places to go."
Great place for a run! It‚Äôs my usual spot for running almost every day.
Favorite park to sit with a friend on a summer evening and watch the sunset or have a good conversation. This park is a beauty in the city.
"Best place to park, eat and play."
AMAZING PARK FOR JOGGING RUNNING WALKING LUNCHING BICYCLE ROLLER SKATES AND SMALL LAC WITH DUCK IN IT AND MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OUT OF THIS WORLD EATERY AND REAL COFFEE PLACES FROM SCRATCH. THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IS KING IN FOREIGN FOOD. ..CHECK IT OUT

"17,000 Hours Played

""Good Park"""
Very lovely and lots of tables for picnics.
"Nice huge public park, clean, with tennis courts, a small artificial lake, baseball fields, volleyball nets, picnic tables, benches, parking (not free), etc. Unfortunately, there's no attraction in the close proximity of the park, but it's not far from downtown. Great place to go with kids."
"It's a very nice park. Took our wedding pictures there. Can be crowded at times, but usually it's because of an event."
very nice and fantastic park
Very nice spot to chill overlooking the pond and have a conversation.
What a fabulous place for a stroll in the middle of the city!  And perfectly situated along many walking routes to and fro.  More cities should have more park spaces like this.
IT WAS GOOD AND FUN
Great place to enjoy during summer
Very quite relaxing park also possible to hang out with friends and have a barbeque. Great amount of trees making nice shadows. Or a place where your dog can meet and play with other dogs.
For summer of course! Nice park in the middle of the city. Nice for a jog or a run or some fun in the sun.
Beautiful place to relax with friends or even on your own. Lots of green space to make your own and lots of lovely ducks.
Beautiful lakeside with lots of ducks and other bird life to see in August! There are many benches and tables to sit and jungle gyms for kids to play too.
Great for walking with the baby while visiting the city
"Lovely and peaceful, usually go there to chill have some tea or choco-cafe, run or take a walk..."
"Great place for a stroll. The squirrels don't get scared of you, they will come up to you for food."
"Well Parc La Fontaine is always a great place to go in middle of down town... highly recommended it for pick-nick, take kids to play or just meditate and do yoga!!!"
"One of the calm, bland destinations in the city with a duck pond ,which make people spend their beautiful evenings even more incredible.
I had many memories laying on those passages.
A lot of space for fitness freaks and sport addicts,  especially in winter, city arranges  ice scating tracks on the frozen water basin, which is a must try choice when you are in montreal
Suer has much more to speak from chrping of the birds to snack thieve squirrels. Autumn shows the beauty and feel of you  eing in canada."
"A lovely park in the proximity of downtown, you can not get a better one around there for jogging, walking, relaxing and making a party"
If you're into parks like I am then you'll love this awesome spot!
Too many people out and about. For those of us with weakened immune systems re-opening the parks and not maintaining social distancing is not safe...
"A huge park with a fountain, bike trails, walking trails, tennis courts, soccer areas, base ball fields, tables, benches... Big mix of people doing many different things. Lots of green, shade, a kids area. The best park in Montreal. Can come for a BBQ and beer, weekly Jazz in the park, there's a Bistro, lots of room for your activities."
The park was so beautiful. The trees changing colors. The fountains and the monuments. The was even a NYCPD cop car there(pretty sure they were filming a movie) my fiance and I had a lovely stroll through the park during our visit to Montreal
Simply amazing! Call your family and friends to enjoy a dusk having a good conversation during a picnic
"What a great vibe! Between all the different activities from bowling to villeyball, music, walking and picnics to live concerts, it is an amazing place to spend a summer eevning with friends and family. Even the dog park offers a wading pool for a dog dunk!"
"Big and beautiful. Go at night, or any time of day. Lots of music playing, people sitting out on the lawns and benches. Very cool place. Love the trees"
"This park is pretty big, and it has so many nice chilling spots. Will definitely come back for a picnic aside of the pond."
"Great for picnic, BBQ and friend and family gatherings"
Very nice place! Perfect for chilling in the summer and ice skating in the winter.
Astonishing in summer
"I come here every year to skate. Its a nice place. Even if getting to the skating rink can be a little hazardous, depending where you park.

You can bring you skates or rent them on the spots as wepl as a few other items."
"Nice place to meet up with friends and have fun playing baseball, soccer, etc. Also, you could have a picnic there next to the lake. Bathroom available, great weather because of the trees."
"Love it, but really crowded. Overrated."
"One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal. You can arrive by walking from Mont royal station. Ideal to walk, jogging or enjoy a sweet spot alone or with your friends. Not a place to practice sports; but ideal to have a great bbq or a picnic dayüçû. Or just walk your üêï!"
"Very pleasant urban park. Dog park, children playground and ice rink (in winter)."
So much space!  Pond is wonderful to sit by and watch the wildlife.

One of the greatest park in Montreal!
Great place for all ages. Really nice place to nap or walk
Beautiful park located near the Plateau area. Very clean and relaxing. Been!
Best urban park in Montreal!
Amazing place to hang out
Green space getaway. This spot is always reliable for a decompress with enough trees to provide shelter from the sun throughout the entire park. Can easily run around the entire perimeter under 5km.
An excellent place to get relaxing and enjoy the nature and a quiet atmosphere
Really clean and lovely with all the  ducks swimming around ‚òÄÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåª
I saw the fountain. It was meh. But the Parc was pretty fly. Although I saw a woman who let her toddler son take a leak on a tree. Pants all the way down in front of everyone. No shame. That kid is going places.
"Wonderful, even though we were just passing through. Our kids begged to stop and lay down in the shade on a hot day."
"If you like outdoor sports or just taking the sun or maybe going out of daily routine, this park is a great place to do just that"
as always great park!
"It's really a great parc with a lot of space, playgrounds and other terrains for activities.
Considering it is such a good parc though, it is extremely popular so expect a lot of people. It ain't a good play for intimacy :P!
Still, you can find a cozy spot where you won't be bothered by anyone and you can somewhat wonder away in your sleep or in a deep conversation with a lover or with friends.
A beautiful pond is in the middle decorated with a few fountains here and there.
During summer, there's usually a couple of activities/small festivals going on, so it's always worth a shot."
Lovely peaceful place to enjoy
One of the best urban parks in the country. Worth a visit if you're in the area!
As always a good place to visit!
Hockey in ze winter (2 or 3 outdoor rinks whaaaaat?!?!). Foot in the summer (good level). Go out there and play. Have fun. Go go go.
very nice park. something for everyone.  kids park to bird wathing to different sport cycling. scenic.

Beautiful!
"A great place to come and enjoy yourself have a picnic  read a book,take your dog to the dog run, play frisbee.....meet  other people"
Great place to spend time with family and friends. Good place for walking. Great place for relaxing.
"Beautiful park, perfect for a stroll or just to sit and enjoy being outside. The squirrels are very cute and daring, most likely because they are being fed so often."
Beautiful parc!
"This is a very nice place to walk around in the plateau, have picnic and have a nice time outside. It have outdoor playground for kids and sports fields and a restaurant. It also have a lagoon (the reason for the name) that is beautiful when filled with water, which is not always . It could be better maintained though."
"Any season of the year...always serene...
For parking ... We use Avenue Calixa-Lavall√©e"
Not much to do in winter past 4pm
"Beautiful park with about a million squirrels.  Aussie, of you want to see squirrels (and I know you do), come here!"
"I love this park, particularly in winter. The lake freezes and you can skate on it but it's not the best ice surface. I'm sure it's lovely in all seasons but it's a great place to relax"
It is one of the best park in Montreal
Beautiful park
It's a pretty nice park but there isn't really much to do there because there aren't any playgrounds and the grass isn't really clean.
It ok need some love to make it great again
Beautiful green oasis in the city's heart. Every season has sth to offer.
Quiet and inviting.  It was a hot day the water was welcoming at the pool.
Huge and quiet park but not very well maintained but still love it!
Lots of birds
Lafontaine Parc in the summer is awesome to hang out at...winter is also beautiful!!! Go feed some chips to the squirrels.
Hey this was great! You can drink in public with friends as long as its a picnic*
Excellent offleash dog park. Good place to laze around with a bottle of wine on a Sunday afternoon.
If you would like a place to relax just go there!
"Lovely park, a lot of space. Very good location"
"Where: La Fontaine Park - Montreal

"Blessed be the day that this park was created! It's such a great place to walk your dog, go for a picnic or a walk."
"Beautiful park...pond...walking paths. Close to food, snacks, and restaurants.  Tall trees.."
Really nice park to walk around or sit down near the pond
"Awesome in winter for skating with frozen lake, lights and music. My favourite park in the city."
Excellent for dogs because of a large enclosed dog run. This park has a population of albino squirrels that are fun to feed. Attractive shirtless bodies abound by the synthetic lake. Fun to watch circus performers and acrobats practice routines by stringing tightropes between trees.
We went skating on the lake in this park. Had a great time. The ice was very nice and there was plenty of room to skate. They have equipment for Learners. They have indoor change rooms and snack bar and restaurant.
I love this park. A nice place to have a barbacue and some beers ofcourse
It is a nice park with ponds.
"For a city park, this place is awesome. A lot going on here on a summer day. Nice pond with koi fish and ducks, which is transformed into a skating rink in the winter. The lands are spacious, with lots of room for picnics, playgrounds and pools for children, a good bike path, and free parking when you can get a spot in the central lot. Beautiful trees, champagne squirrels, and even a train."
"Unfortunately we went there only before spring, so the park is still a bit barren. But I can imagine it must be a beautiful place when it's green in summer time."
"Went there for skating, it's free(if you have your own skates and locks), has lots of lights, there is and indoor facility to change your skates and bathrooms. The park itself is pretty big and beautiful for a little walk. Bear in mind it's fresh water skating, so the ice is not the smoothest. But still fun and beautiful."
Such a fun park with all sorts of activities happening all the time.
Nice park to go to... Especially during the summer lol
"My favourite park in Montreal. Great for all kinds of activities. Big playground for children of all ages, dog park, many kinds of sports areas. Theatre and shows, wading pools for kids in the summer and free skating in the winter. Also great area to snow sled with kids."
"Ideally placed on the plateau, accessible all day long from every corner with subway and buses, with dog park, volley-ball p√©tanque baseball football (the real one) and American rugby, and green grass, benches, trees, and a lac ... id√©al for everyone including family pic-nic !!"
I love it
Nice park to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature without leaving the city. There‚Äôs a nice lake with plenty of benches to enjoy as well as no shortage of walking and biking trails.
Nice park in the middle of the city. Lots of little critters running around.

Beautiful and peaceful afternoon. Best park in the city
Just beautiful. More than just a walk in the park.
A quiet park in a residential area.
Nice place to unwind
Amazing place to hang around or play frisbee with your friends. Its very common to see random  people play musical instruments around the park. The atmosphere is very pleasant and enjoyable.
This park has everything. Lots of activities and a great mix of people.
Crowded but quite a nice park
"Great park! Very big. Lots of paths. Often quite full of people lounging, picnicing and playing games in the summer. Skating in the winter. Lots of trees but open fields too. Volleyball courts. A bocce ball area. Baseball diamonds and a soccer field. Might be tennis courts too. The large pond is really nice in the summer. Theres a small amplitheater. Always something going on in this park. Great for a picnic or for a few evening beers with friends. I think the law is you can have beer or wine if you also have food. It's kind of like a mini central park in Montreal."
Beautiful place for evening walk
"My favorite parc in Montreal. If you like to ice skating,  you need to go there during winter. They have a huge lake to do it."
Chill and relaxing vibes this afternoon with a nice sunset over the Fontaine not totally filled yet. Summer it's almost there...
It's a Great Park in to go walking running hiking and doing outdoor exercises in the morning as well as evening and it has a beautiful water pond
It's so beautiful.
We had an amazing time.
"It is a great place if you just want to hang out with friends and spend the day relaxing. Bring your food and a blanket and just spend the time socializing with family and friends. Visually the park is okay. There is a lot of open grassy areas to sit down on but not much else. There's a man made lake in the middle but even that looks a bit gross. It is a green colour and I don't find that very appealing. There isn't that many trees but other than that, it's a good place to just spend the day outdoors."
"This park has a unique facet for each season, the four of them equally beautiful."
Beautiful little man made lake with ducks
"This parc has a lot of energy, people go there for barbecues, to play some sports (baseball, volleyball, soccer) and also enjoy the nature in the middle of the city. I consider this parc a little version of NY's Central Park :-)"
"This park is amazing during the whole year. Beautiful to relax and walk around through summer, beautiful colours during autum and fun for a slide or ice skating during winter."
Best parc in Montreal
"Great park with kids playground, volleyball, a lake and more."
"Iconic Montr√©al park. What a pleasure to hang out there with friends with food and drinks. Whether it's during the day or at night, Parc Lafontaine offers a great vibe and yet is super spacious so you're not stepping on anyone's toes."
"Vibrant and active park full of all sorts of activities for all walks of life. You'll find plenty of young folks practicing their favorite hobbies, but there are also playground for the kids and a pond to relax around. The pond is picturesque attracting new weds and their photographers."
During winter you can skate on the canal. You can rent skates and there are warming huts to warm you up and change
"Beautiful,  peaceful and popular park to walk your dog, read,  or admire ducks and ducklings enjoying a dip in the water"
"Great place to walk and exercice, winter or summer."
Excellent park for friends and family located in the heart of montreal. Good place place to hang around.
"Not a family place anymore! In the middle of the afternoon too many teens and young adults smoking cannabis as well as drinking at the same time. A few years ago I enjoyed taking my daughter to the park, no we avoid it like the plague."
"Lots of seagulls and insects above our heads, but, really cool people to talk to"
"Very big, well maintained, variety of activities.  Totally a very nice park"
It's huge amazing place to talk a long walk
Popular Mtl Stoners corner. Extremely chill and excellent ice scating during winter.
Enjoyed running here. Big spacious and clean.

Amazing autumn!!
I like this park but it is not clean enough.. there are a lot of garbage in the lake.. and also on the grass.. some bicyclists don‚Äôt drive carefully and you have to take care your kids.. otherwise there are a lot of good activities organized  in the summer time..
Good times. Bring a BBQ! Come for a picnic! Play volleyball! Soccer! Baseball! Tennis! Have a few beers! Watch random people play music!
Nice parc in the centre of Montreal. A must see!
"Beautiful view, location is great"
"Very nice place, but A lot of people all the time. In winter you can skate on lake. Lots of activities. Nice for walks. Harder to find parking on the weekend."
"Love this park. It's big and it has a little bit of everything. A nice lake that it's beautiful in every season and paths all over. You can even do ice skating in winter. I've been here for workouts, walks and picnics and I've always had fun. The only caveat is that for running it tends to be super icy in the winter (more so than other places that I've been)."
"It's a nice park. Good enough space for parking.

However, there were large crowds and I couldn't take the smoke. I don't even want to talk about temporary toilets that were installed near parking."
"The shortest distance between two Frisbees is rare air, which science has long struggled to explain. And yet it exists. Very green come summer, very white in winter, one can only wonder how many dreams have been hatched, how many romances those arching branches have witnessed. Cigarette butts play their role too, reminding the sun searching souls that nothing is prefect."
Perfect spot to chillout a bit :)
A great place to relax and have a nice walk in more natural surroundings.
"One of the best, feel good parks in Montreal."
"Great place, so many things to do  !  Dogs are welcome and they have a dog park. There's also a very nice artificial lake and you can skate on it in the winter."

Peaceful and great park for taking a walk and jogging
"Awesome volleyball courts in the summer, great hockey rink  in the winter!"
Large park with lots of room to run around or relax with books/friends. Really pretty to walk through in the winter as well.
Popup up outdoors
My fave mtl parc!
Beautiful and cozy!
"One of Montreal's gems, Parc La Fontaine embodies the charm of the plateau, with musicians, people exercising, families, dog owners, and people from all walks of life mingling.  It's  a substantial park, for an urban green zone, with a big pond, and nice manicuring.

A truly excellent place to relax on a nice day.

The one point of contention is the amphitheater, which seems like a promising venue, but which is very run-down.  I've never seen or heard of any performances being staged in this venue, which strikes me as unfortunate, given its potential."
Nice peaceful park where you can enjoy a glass of wine or whatever
"Big playground for kids, pond, kiddie pool, baseball and tennis. Beware, parking is not free! Paid $4.50CAD for 90 minutes at the booth. People sunbathing around the pond. Lots of bikers and runners. Relaxing atmosphere. It is clean and well kept. Lots of picnic tables. Great for a family walk. Saw an amphitheater. Probably they have some festivals."
Garden of Eden... eat your heart out!! Plus this place is snake free! ;)
Beautuful park. A piece of green right inside the city.
This park is large and a good relaxing point to hang out that's close to old Montreal and Mont Royal.
Very cool place for walking and relax in a sunny sunday...
It is nice. So many people even at night
Very nice place to visit in a good summer evening...
This would have been a nice park except that it is not maintained properly. The grass is overgrown and there are a few homeless people loitering in the park. There is a side of the park next to the water where young people still hang out. The city could improve this further.
"Big, yet cozy park!"
Beautiful park with a small lake in the middle. Well maintained like most parks in Montreal!
"Great park for exercising, relaxing or feeding those fat squirrels"

Place to relax during summer. Walk around the lake or just lie down and relax in the sun.
"This beautiful park in the heart of Montr√©al is great for sitting on the grass, and let time go by in the summer. In the winter, a portion of the lake is used for ice skating (for free!) and if you don't have skates of your own, you can rent some at the chalet next to the rink."
Most beautiful park in Montreal. Bring a throw and you ll have a great time for sure (eat drink walk relax sleep tan anything)

"Amazing park:  tennis court, dog park, artificial lake, soccer field, baseball field. Got everything in the center of Le Plateau!!"
"Always a relaxing time while in the park. Also, you get to see interesting things while people watching. Musicians, yogis, cute doggies, families, sporties, funny & weird drunks. In the summertime, there's free wifi. Public toilets are convenient too. A tchoo-tchoo train circles around the park, $4 a ride per person. You can't be let down while at Laf Park."
Nice park to share activities with friends and family
One of my favorite parks has a theatre in the middle of it all and building where they do all sorts of activities!
It's really a nice parc ‚ô•Ô∏è

Lovely parc . Perfect to skate in the winter or have picnic by the pond
Big parc with many things to do. The lac is transformed in a big ice skating are in the winter. Really great place
Very clean park. They should add a compost bin beside the garbage and recycle bin at the Avenue parc-fontaine and Cherries corner.
Amazing big park everyone... !! Love walking here with my dog

Nice park in the city. Large lake. You can spend the afternoon reading. Or just walk through to get to your destination.
Nice Park with several paths available all year long for wandering quietly
Spacious and lovely playground for different age groups. Absolutely our fav in downtown!
"If you stop at Saint-Liboire for you gas, you ought to keep going a bit further for an amazing poutine at Dave & Dan. The cheese is super fresh and it feels like there is more of it than there are fries. Amazing!"
We love everything about this  B&B. We highly recommend.
"Very nice and huge parc, plenty of place to relax on the grass and watch the fountain. Also great for walks with your loved one or friends.
Usually kept very clean"
Lovely place. Just wish the the fountain lived up to the parks name. Instead of being what looks like a bunch of sad hoses spraying aimlessly into the sky.
"Nice place. Free parking slot.
Small lake with natural ducks and birds.

Very beautiful in fall!"
Random city park. Not particularly well laid out. Too many paths edging out the greenspaces. Lacking something but I can't figure out what...

Very pretty park. Lots of characters too.
"Beautiful place and big lake,  100% i lovely."

"Large park with a long pond which shores presents great green areas for picnics and walks along its long contour. A nice well shaded forest is a blessing in the Summer. Music, picnics, families having a rekax time...  right in the neighborhood of the Montreal city's Mount Royal Plateau"
Great place to stroll and relax in the heart of montreal
"Ideally on of the best parks in the city after Mont Royal.
What makes this park special is that it is right next to a lot of restaurants,  there is always something happening, and it is great for both running and biking.
If you are visiting definitely check it out, and don't forget to eat Poutine at la banquise after, it is right next to it."
Really beautiful oasis in the city.
"One of the best known and loved park in Montreal. During the winter the frozen lake turns into an ice-skating free platform, music provided!"

Warm friendly and welcoming.

Good place to relax for four seasons.  Normally there are not too many people. It is the destination of marathon montreal.
All year long great place be it winter or summer time to relax. Very well taken care of.
"One of the best parks in the city. A bit more shaded than the main Mont Royal park, great for sports chill outs and bbq"
Beautiful city park in Montreal with lots going on everyday. Hosts many different festivals and has an outdoor cinema.
Nice park for summer and winter... The main pond becomes an ice rink. In summer there is a train for kids that does around the park.
Awesome place! We had a lot of fun!
Nice place for skating during winter
"Hands down my favorite park in Montreal. Well maintained and located (near a bunch of nice groceries and SAQs for picnics), gorgeous pond and trees, and great jogging and biking paths that circulate around the parc. Usually there are a few local musicians jaming respectfully. Perfect for families, outings with friends, and for a nice summer date."
Lovely place. Went to take some night shots during a snow fall. Felt pretty much safe(up until ~10PM)
"Great park lots of activities to do. Baseball, tennis, volleyball and more"
Beautiful quiet park at the heart of Montreal. Also very nice location for spending time with family and kids. Very family friendly location.

"Nice atmosphere, quite enjoyable to sit around the pond and listen to some local artists play music."
"Fantastic park for going for a walk or a picnic in the summer. In the winter there is a large outdoor ice rink and two small hockey rinks (you can rent skates or bring your own for a fee). In the summer there are also various performances (such as dance shows, theatre, movies) several times a week, free of charge. There are tennis courts, p√©tanque play areas, beach volleyball, a soccer field, a baseball field, and even an enclosed dog park. There‚Äôs also a large field to play whichever sport you want (in front of the dog park, probably need to book it unless no one is using it) and plenty of space to play outdoor games or make bbq, though it can get crowded despite how large the park is. And of course there‚Äôs a large pond with a fountain and ducks. You don‚Äôt even need to come with food ‚Äî there‚Äôs Ma Poule Mouill√©e and La Banquise right next to it and a d√©panneur to buy drinks. Pretty much everything you would ever want from a park."
Big park in Montreal
Such a lovely place to hang out alone or with friends. It's an oasis of nature in the middle of the nice but busy plateau mont royal.
Lovely setting in an urban environment
"Very cute Park(for the urban east) , nice to come chill with friends. If you're used to BC it's nothing special but for Montreal it's Dope."
"Daydreaming about going back to the park to walk my pup.  The most peaceful, relaxed park in Montreal.  Hurry up summer!"
"A good park to go with some friends. On the weekend, there are a lot of people gather there, and it has a great sense of community. I don't advise taking a swim in the artificial lake since it's notoriously very dirty, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal! Other than that, feel free to eat your lunch there, or go biking. For a more impressive parc, visit the Mont Royal, or even the Parc Maisonneuve."
A great urban park with a good playground on the north side for kids. One of the best and most fun parks in the city.
Beautiful park. Went there to toboggan in the snow and ended up by the ice skating area. Beautiful regardless if the season
"This is possibly one of the most unsafest/dirtiest parks in Mtl as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't always like this many decades ago, but alas, now it's simply not the same anymore which is sad because the park itself has immense potential. You'll often encounter dog 'residue' or loitering all over the place) on your path if you care to take a stroll. Unfortunately, this park is not only gross, but dangerous. Despite the police station (pdq) 38 being across the street, it doesn't stop questionable crowds from discouraging people from going to squat for a picnic or a night walk. Don't let your children play or go there alone."
"Very beautiful park, spent the picnic with my friend berry"
Lots of activities to do. Very peaceful. Nice to do picnic
"It's clean and beautiful small pond in the middle. You can also do BBQ here, and washing room near by as well"

One of the many beautiful parks of Montreal. Ideal for picnic. Also the pond in the middle makes it even prettier.
"Big park and I liked the lake..but the grass needs some work, and it took me forever to find the washroom."

"Magnificent, big and many things to do ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Spacious park with a variety of scenes. Good for reflection, music, painting and sports. Best spot in the plateau for me."

a beautiful lake and lots of big trees.
very nice place to hang out and just chill.
very nice restos in walkable distance.
8 mins walk from Sherbrooke metro.
I recommend anyone to come here for a nice little picnic."
"This is for the kiddie pool...the parc itself is beautiful! I took my kids there last Thursday we were all in bathing suits (i am Muslim) and we were approached by a young girl before we even got to the pool....she started to tell me there is a new policy that you can't go inside if you don't have a swimsuit....i looked at her and said ""I'm wearing a swimsuit"" so I get Inside and noticed I was the only parent with a bathing suit!
I didn't say anything even though I was mad....so I'm playing with my kids and was approached again by a male lifeguard at that point I got mad...started saying look around...I'm the only person with a bathing suit! My burkini is clearly a bathing suit made of Lycra....it's unbelievable how racist people can be..I live in the Plateau....stupidity has no limit...will not go back."

Excellent experience. Very nice place
Not a great place for baseball. The field is too small and there's a huge drainage sewer in the middle of the outfield? The fence is all old and rusty. Not well taken care by the city and not clean. A bunch of dirty old plastic bags tied to the fence...the park emoloyee was late getting it ready....if I never go back perfect!

"Great for kids who like climbing. Section for younger kids is well made too, though it has only 2 swing seats. Good installations, but total lack of shade should be taken into account (sunscreen and hats are a must on sunny days). Water fountain and basic water games but, sadly, no bathrooms."
Simple but nice and calm.

"This is yet another park on Boulevard Gouin that follows the Riviere-des-Prairies river. Being one of the longer ones, it offers a wider variety of panoramas, but the best ones remain those that you get on the river. I would have given it 5 stars had the riverfront been cleaner, but the municipality does precious little maintenance on its parks, especially those that do not attract large crowds."
"Decrepit park devoid of any maintenance since Pierrefonds is part on ""Montr√©al""."
Lovely little park if you want bring your kiddo and avoid splash pads üòâ
"I like this park, it's shady, fenced has real sand( not a woodchips fan). Loads of fun for toddler and preschool age kids üôåüèæ"
Great place for kids and a nice walk with my dogs and if you play boccee üòÅ
Nice ice rink!
Great place to play soccer and basketball! There's a big section for kids and other people as well.
"My neighborhood. A quiet and cozy park that reminds me of utopia. You can play soccer, which turns into a hockey pitch during winter, basketball, take a bath in the fountains, play chess on built in boards or take an adventures behind the abondoned railway."
So basicallly a great park with different courts for bball or soccer or child play but they close the bathroom too early. It was close at 16h30

"A nice place in middle of the residential area, surrounded by the houses, nice place for children, family, a maintained football ground and a baseball arena. its clean and good place for spend evening time."

Good park to walk to chill to have a nice picnic and a nice playground for kids
"The park is so fun, i love those spinny things"
"Good to hang out with family,short of trees."
good for kid and family with a brand new ball park and soccer field
Another one of Montreal's superb artificial soccer fields that are well utilized by the community.
It gets overly crowded sometimes and  could old use a face lift. Adding more more playing structures for the kids would be a great idea too.
This park needs a section for a dog park it is shameful the area that the city wants dog owner to use. Shame on you city of montreal

"This park needs more investment from the government, I‚Äôve seen it for almost 5 years I‚Äôve been living in the area and it has not improved"
Parck Nelson Mandela
It's cool

"Huge, huge park. You can sit anywhere with a bbq... the fountain area is really cool with the spray hitting you when the wind blows & cools you off..pretty area near the water body...the play area was really crowded though. Saw a cricket match in progress & a wedding and several parties.."
"Jarry Park is a few kilometres from the center. To get there, take the metro to the De Castelnau station or the bus that runs along St Lawrence Blvd. It's a short ride from downtown. The park distinguishes itself by its sports facilities. A swimming pool, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, soccer fields and other open spaces will keep you busy. If you're just there to relax, there's a beautifully designed artificial pond that is surrounded with handsome trees."
"It‚Äôs a great place to visit with family and kids and friends. Or if you wanna take a good nap in front of the lake, you will find amazing and super comfortable poolside chairs. If you wanna do a morning or evening walk, you can have a big round circle around but inside the park. If you are planning to do a barbecue with your family or friends, you can find amazing spots. If you wanna do a picnics, it‚Äôs an awesome place to spend your time."
"Big beautiful park with a large variety of activities during the summer. A public pool, tennis courts, baseball field, etc. are available on site. Bathrooms are porta potties and are surprisingly clean! Parking is paid and can be difficult to find for free nearby."
"It's a nice park with an open swimming pool close by. However I would personally suggest to avoid going during the late spring/summer. It gets way too crowded to have any enjoyment, with loud groups everywhere. It gets more quiet (less people) and enjoyable during fall season with the falling leaves."
"I love this park. In the hot afternoon its very busy and hundreds of people are hanging out there. There were 3 football teams playing in one play ground.
Lots of people in the ground. Sometimes base ball teams are also playing there."
"Huge park with lots of space to hang out! Great for picnics, sports, bike rides, bring the kids too! I saw somebody in a hammock and somebody else pitching a tent lol highly recommend taking a stroll to/through Jarry park!"
Nice park really enjoy whenever visit their. But no toilet arrangements for such a huge crowd on weekends especially. My son could not control pee so I took him to a that small toilet but yeww the pot was all full off the tissues and yuck.. very disappointed.

Big spacious park. Great ambiance. Not a great selection of restaurants around
"Jarry Park has been completely renovated in the past decade. There are loads of bocce courts, table tennis, ball fields, and paths. It is a good place to get some fresh air. There is a SPVM post on the St Laurent side...  the park has everything but toilets."

It was quite filled with people, many being glad not to have to wear a mask... :) I'm a bit worried about the environmental degradation, though, I've seen some that lack the instincts of conservation... :("

Wonderful place to visit as a tourist or local. Families and singles and couples and friends just hanging out is was what life is all about. Absolutely beautiful fountain and ducks with their ducklings and sand for the kids and park to play. Just wonderful üòÄ
"This is the second time I've been here, it's a beautiful park, but I've never used any facilities, if there are any. The grass I sat in was clean, I saw families playing with frisbees, kites and soccer balls, and there was enough room for everyone. Even the guy playing the trumpet. I enjoyed the sun and had a relaxing mini picnic. I usually see police officers in and around the park, so it's either really safe, or really not."
Fun place to hang out with friends. Has a huge snow field in winter. Also has many hockey rinks and ice skating Lac-ish thing
This park is phenomenal! It was my stomping ground back in the '70's and 80's. I am totally impressed with the improvements!

There is everything here; skate park, basketball courts, tennis courts, soccer fields, public pool, a lovely large pond with ducks and great water plants, weeping willows, space for cricket, and you can bring your own BBQ.

Excellent park. Pleasant visit on a sunny day. The special event a Turkish gathering of families and plenty children playing on the green grass! An official pool exists. The space is vast. Getting there no problem as Blvd saint Laurent practically makes a border line. The metro is 5-10 min.walk away. Sunny days are ideal. Noticed many bikes on clear routes. Pack up for a picnic on a sunny day and you will remember it for months to come. Winter must be different scenery thus will update when snow falls. In the meantime enjoy summer inside the Jarry park.
Very pretty and nice park to walk in! Good for every season!
Review coming soon!

Jarry Park is a beautiful oasis in a large city."

Got dumped. Not the best experience.
"If you want to watch shirtless old men discuss their motorcycles while Ozzy Osbourne plays in the background, this is the place for you"
Awesome park
"One of the best place to be for walking, jogging etc. Good place to take your kids for relaxation. Good place to have birthday parties. There is a water pool and fountain. You can see birds in the summer. Overall a good maintained park"
"Lots of different fields to play sports (soccer, baseball...) but the park itself is quite bland and flat."
A wonderful place to refresh
Good park lots of space and sport options.
Great park a lot of space for running my kids love it
"For a family day, really good !!!"
"Nice open parc, good to meet up, and for little bbq's..."
Nice dog park
Very nice park. A lot of activities in the summer. Nice spot to chill with a date or friends.
Nice place to relax ;)
"Nice place to walk, play, picnic and fun with family and friends. The little lake view is awesome. The place is safe because on the roadside there is a police station. If you plan to visit during the Tennis tournament, you might have problem to park your vehicle. So check the events before you visit, specially during the summer time."
"The park and duck pond are wonderfully maintained... if barbecuing I strongly recommend setting up camp on the small island inside of the pond. The public pool is as classic as they come, although the diving boards are a little stiffer than average. We saw baby ducks, and a beautiful black bird none of us could formally identify. If you arrive at the park after dark, and hate mosquitoes, you should bring some type of web to keep them off of your legs. Can't wait to return, it is very neat and tidy!"
"It's spacious and in the summer you can lie on the grass, although I don't know how that fits in with your morality. I guess you could lie in the winter too, nothing stopping you, it just seems more effective in the summer as being prone on the plants lowers your interlocutor's guard and makes them more receptive to your version of the 'truth'."
Met a lovely squirrel there. His name was Marty. Bathrooms in the cop shop were weird though.
Very big park with a lake fountain and lots of fall colors!!!
Beautiful park to go.
"Great outdoor relaxation. There are a lot of things to do for your leisurely day. A great park with baseball, soccer, hockey, swimming, BBQ and lots of space for everyone including a pond with ducks"
Very large park in a crowded part of town.
"Big park with several sports fields and a track.  A stone's throw form a metro station. A heaven for dog lovers, and young family's as there's also a playground"
"Huge space, and I beautiful and parc!  Perfect for for families"
The advertisement is true: it's a park! (A nice big one)
"This park has tennis courts in addition to the stadium - where the Roger's Cup tournament takes place. There is a large pond with ducks (but no fish) with a tall fountain at the center. A kid's playground that includes swings and an outdoor kid's play pool. An outdoor pool (separate from the kid's play pool). A baseball field. Other grassy fields for soccer and whatever other leisurely activities you wish to engage in. A skating rink. Paved paths along the park for biking, walking, running. It would probably take you 20-30 min to walk at a moderate pace around the park. Overall, a great community park. :)"
Wonderful park especially in winter it's so quiet
A great stop after cycling with a friend üòÇ
Suuuuuuper good!!! Suuuuper tasty!!

"Beautiful park. It's a nice place to relax, throw a Frisbee, or even catch pokemon."
They are sticking to the limit of access. Good staff

There are water fountains and public toilets. I wish they had more though."
"Lots of space and a must when the weather is nice. If you want to exercise (running, basketball, beach volley, etc), or just relax they have got you covered"

Best place to enjoy and spend free time.
Park was clean and people I met there were friendly.
Visited in fall..was a bit smelly at night!
Lovely place to connect with the nature!!
A beautiful green space in the middle of the city! Nice place to get active or just taking a nice nap in the park üòÅ
"Great park to relax, play soccer, and have a small picnic."
Good for summer time. You can bring your own BBQ grill and enjoy. People mostly do birthdays at the park. Few swings for kids to enjoy. And a small outdoor pool which kids loved the most.
"Really beautiful park with basketball courts, baseball courts, soccer fields, a pond, a track going around the entire park, enclosed dog run, swimming pool, large open spaces to bbq or hang out. Free, clean and well maintained. Attached to the tennis courts. Winter activities include skating rink and across country skiing."
Great
Big but FLAT park. One of the ugliest in Montr√©al.
Had  family picnic. Vibrant park with lots of activity. Great dog run as well.
Party atmosphere very enjoyable on the week end
Amazing place to relax with some friends
"Jarry Park Stadium (French: Stade Parc Jarry) is a tennis stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was formerly a baseball stadium, home to the Montreal Expos (today's Washington Nationals), from 1969 to 1976. The Expos were Major League Baseball's first Canadian franchise. It served as a temporary home (for eight seasons) until the domed Olympic Stadium was finished and made available to the Expos. The ballpark was typically called simply (and inaccurately, since the stadium was built within the larger park) ""Jarry Park"" or Parc Jarry. The stadium hosted two American football National Football League preseason games in 1969; August 25 (Detroit Lions vs Boston Patriots) and September 11
The stadium originally began as a baseball field in Montreal's north end (Villeray) in a public park known as Jarry Park. The only structure was the small unroofed grandstand behind the home plate and backstop area, with seating for approximately 3,000 people.
Beyond right field was a pre-existing swimming pool in the city park. Long before the ""splash hits"" at Oracle Park in San Francisco and PNC Park in Pittsburgh, there were occasional ""splash hits"" here. The first and most famous was a 495 ft (151 m) blast by Willie Stargell on July 23, 1969‚Äîleading locals to call the pool ""Willie's pool"" (French: la piscine de Willie). One of those was hit by Willie McCovey during a 6-4 win over the Expos on August 24, 1969. The idea of the swimming pool itself was later replicated in Chase Field in Phoenix.
The stadium was rather sparse, given that it was intended to be only a temporary home for a maximum of four years. The clubhouses were located along the left field line behind the stands. Due to its orientation, games in April and September frequently started with the setting sun shining right in the faces of first basemen. Eventually, it was decided to delay games until the sun finished setting. It was completely exposed to the elements, which was a particular problem at the beginning and end of the season, given Montreal's long winters. There was a huge gap between the left-field bleachers and the third-base grandstands, resulting in second basemen and shortstops getting buffeted by cold winds early and late in the season. The Expos frequently had to postpone early and late-season games because there was no protection for the fans. Even allowing for its temporary status, the field conditions were among the worst in the majors.
Although the center field distance was posted as 420 feet, it was actually 417 feet to straightaway center, and 420 feet to the deep left and right center field corners."
Very nice but raining today.
"Well located, easy to commute (stm bus / metro) and has decent parking space. Nice place to spend time with family and friends (BBQ, play, swim)."
"Superb park, a hidden gem just north of little Italy. The park is huge and boasts a large number of different sections that each have their own vibe and activities going on. Beautiful lake with fountain and scenic seating areas, the tennis stadium and tennis courts that host the Rogers Cup, football pitches, baseball, children's play area, skatepark, outdoor swimming pool (open in the summer and free). This park really has it all!"
Great for tennis lovers

"Extremely nice park in the north east end of Montreal. There are lots of small ponds around, and lots of walking/bike paths perfect for the summer. It's also right near little italy, so you can spend a lot more time exploring the area and have food right after!"

"Attended a tennis match and lucked out with seats situated right underneath a little overhang which sheltered us from the little bit of rain without having to take out an umbrella.
The view of the court was also spot on.
Nice enough park that is well kept and appears to be well used."
"Park Jarry has a lot of advantages, I will name some:
1- its central location and closeness to the Metro makes it very accessible
2- BBQ allowed with facilities like special ash and burning charcoal bins
3- many possible a activities: soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming pool, trees for slackline, ping-pong, BMX, water jets and kids playground, Ice skating, hockey, cross-country skiing, ....
4- all ages friendly from birth age till 100 years passing through all the generations including families.
5- at a multicultural node where everyone comes to relax and enjoy the green and the nature.

Park Jarry is a great value to the surrounding neighborhoods and also for the people who come from far due to its accessibility."

Such a magical park !
Ambience very good
"Big, beautiful park with a lovely pond with a huge fountain in the center. Really huge dog run. Lots of tables and benches. So-so parking. Only issue was lack of public bathrooms and lots of bees (we were planning to have a picnic, but got chased away from two areas by bees)."

"It's a nice mellow place to play any sport, game or take the kids to, or just hang and bbq at. Lovely park"
"I lived my youth around there and my Grandma used to bring me to the Expos games. I was very young but she taught me everything about baseball lol. Then in 3rd grade, our teacher brought us to a  game. Then in High School I'd gather up with the guys cause I was now playing baseball with them and go often to see the Expos in the bleachers for $0.50 lol. I had my children around there still and brought them in the playground, we had 2 skating rinks 1 for hockey and 1 for free skating which I skated with my 2 sons and in the summer they played baseball and after we'd go swim in the small pool and growing up and go to the big pool. I have so many good memories. I even remember when my granddaddy brought me at the park, I was about 5 years old and taught me to fly a quite several times and go on the swings and pushed me, just as I did with my kids. My parents still live around there. It's been 58 years. And only good things happened. Specially to go and see several concerts. Genesis, Elton John, I think Supertramp and so many others. And of course Tennis became one of the biggest event. Just awesome living close by."

Favs ?

Excellent
"Good park with artificial pond, enclosed dog park, artificial & natural grass soccer pitches, baseball diamonds, cricket pitch, swimming pool, wadding pool, playground for children of all ages, beach volleyball court, gazebo, rollerblade hockey rink, skatepark, basketball courts and a pro tennis stadium.  In winter the pond is groomed for ice skating and a hockey rink with boards is also available.  The park is nicely landscaped although some of the baseball diamonds are in terrible condition."
This is a really good park. Lots of stuff to do and alot of open space for activities. The only downside is jarry parc is usually filled with people doing many things. I would also avoid driving because parking tends to fill up on sunny days.

I admit that I have not been here but one of my favorite people in the world to grace this Earth played here over 49 years ago. Rusty Staub a great baseball player who should be in the MLB Hall of Fame but an even better human being. Rusty led a life reflective of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He fed the hungry homeless and lonely. He raised millions of dollars for the sick and injured.  He opened his doors of his restaurants to those who were shut out. This is a place I hope to attend!!! God bless Daniel Rusty Staub

Serene view. Riviere des prairies is so calm. There are a few benches to view the river and very few people
Fine your inner peace hereü§éü§é‚ù§
Simple and  calm!
"One of my favourite places to be when meditating with the ancient trees. Unfortunately, this used to be a beautiful forest that was destroyed for the construction of the hideous A25 bridge. What's also unfortunate is that people litter a lot, and I spend a good portion of my time when visiting to be cleaning up after humans. If you visit, I ask that the greenery be respected."
Nice
Nice spot for Wi-Fi
"Very tiny space, under the autoroute 25. Nice view of river."
A park is sort of a big word for this place. I would say it's more of a peddle or walk rest stop. No bathrooms available at this location

There are amenities to change and washrooms (now closed due to covid)."
So happy the city of Pierrefonds decided to put a skating ring close to us. It's large with 3 benches. The ice is really well taken care of.

Nice place
üëçüëå
A small park good for walking dogs
Cool park
"Small, clean park. Had takeout on a bench here."
"Cute, but for the year it was closed for renovations, not worth it."
The play structures are simple but wonderful. Even a place to fill a water bottle!
"Quiet,  nice set-up. I would be great once it's open again for children to play, ONLY when it's safe"
its plain so ehh
Nice
"really bad. So much money was claimed they've poot on to it, but it doesn't look that way.  There is basically nothing for kids to play with. one huge slide,  and lets of dangerous spots for the kids. So disappointed with that park..."
Nice ! Original !
It's sloped with a few benches and a path
Great park!
Nice little park
Great parc! Very quiet and a super cool fountain. During the summer you can find random bands playing at the parc!
Most iconic area of Montreal. Beautiful neighborhood ‚ù§ as well. You may find art hidden here and there. Architecture to be appreciated and colors to cheer up. It almost feels like a neighborhood designed by Tim Burton.
"Beautiful park, we always go there for walking. Very refreshing"
"Square Saint-Louis is one of the prettiest public spaces in the city. It's a small and popular neighborhood park. The look and feel are reminiscent of European parks, but the houses around it are typical of Montreal. Many were built towards the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. They are very well maintained as is the park and the whole neighborhood. If there's a fairy tale setting in Montreal, this square is definitely it."
June at this place is exeptional its not only beUtifull with the colored houses but a landmark
"Besides being undeniably beautiful, Last night I fell asleep on one of the benches by mistake and with my phone in my hands my electric scooter next to me and my school bag for hours and when I woke up my phone was missing which was the only thing that was missing and some person was nice enough to actually take it and wait for me to call it and actually give it back to me so just to say that this park already contains some level of respectable honest people so I give it 5 stars"
Beautiful place. Funny stylish houses and funny moments with squirrels. Must see!
"Beautiful place, but so many marginals and weird drunk/drugged people..."
"the fountain aint yet open üò≠but loving the parc,lots of nice memories there!"
lovely space surrounded by gorgeous old homes. lots of benches to rest and relax
Beautiful serene peaceful noisy cheerful calm environment :)
Beautiful place to take a coffee and sit. The houses are gorgeous and it is especially nice in the summer when the fountain is on!
It has a quartier latin feeling. Good place to meet with friends and have a inconspicuous drink.
"Cute local park, I personally prefer it in the winter."
Loved it! Nice place to hang out and chill
"Lovely park in Montreal. It's peaceful and extremely beautiful. The houses nearby are very stylish and, in a way, made me remind the NY Central Park or some parks in Europe. Worth visiting place for sure."
Beautiful little park with a fountain and charming surrounding houses. There are frequently musicians playing live music here as well!
"Big park, amazing things to do over there like you can see in the pictures snowman in the snow and in the summer lot of fun activities."
Great place for relaxing with the amazing colorful victorian houses surrouding u
This is a wonderful square surrounded by buildings exhibiting an architectural style that reminds me of New Orleans or old Montreal...go figure. This is a wonderful place for taking your own photos. My only complaint is that there was signficant road construction in the area at the time of our visit. The pedestrian walkways were also very icy and hazardous.
Small but nice park
Don't worrubiysbevkkwrkr wjs√†
Small urban park flanked by picturesque homes

Nice park. Well located. Perfect if you are looking for a quiet place to rest.
Nice place to sit and take morning coffee.
Beautiful garden.
"Very nice place. Lots of pigeons and squirrels. Pigeons landing on your hand, to have a little treat. Even a crazy squirrel, very friendly, that climbs all over you, sitting on your shoulder. üòã"
Lovely place to relax
A unique park giving its own scent in the Plateau
"shady, spacious park, with big old trees and nice plantings, right in the middle of a busy part of the city. a true oasis, with benches and even a little caf√© with tables. full of interesting folks to look at, too."
"Nice quite beautiful park. Full on fountain in the centre of park. Lots of benches, walkways, and grass to sit on."
The colorful houses are ü§©
A nice park in the middle of a quiet neighbourhood with dogs and squirrels running around. A pretty fountain in the middle and surrounded by houses with beautiful architecture.
Taken some dates the to randomly salsa dance in public. In fact you might see me there today. So If you see two people randomly salsa dancing. It's most like me.
"Great place for a picnic if you like squirrels and hobos, but 4 stars for how beautiful it is with the little town houses overlooking. Very picturesque."
"Beautiful, colorful, historic homes surrounding a nice little park."
"Beautiful little place. Even in -15¬∞C, it is worth it."
Beautiful park and neighborhood. Definitely worth a visit when in Montreal!
A very iconic place on the Plateau.

Nice spot to relax
"Nice walk around, right next to the Sherbrook station. Easy to go there !"
"Nice small place to sit, relax, and feed the squirrels!!! Sometimes there is people playing music, sometimes you can only enjoy the sound of the fountain. Traffic can be noisy around during the day but at night, the ambiance is almost romantic."
Fun park to watch the fountain with your kids. No kids activity centers but a nice place to hang out.
Awesome place üòé
"Lovely square/park to people watch, sit and read, grab a coffee or just go for a walk."
Nice place to meet and chat with friends.
"This wasn't what i've expected at all. There were only 2 painted houses. The park was a bit impoverished. The only thing wich was nice were the squirls, chasing eachother."
Beautiful park. Delicious coffee. Great spot.
It's a quiet place to chill.
Beautiful
Lovely colorful houses
"Cute nice park, pretty clean. People from all walks of life hang out there. I recommend going during a sunny day or with a friend at night.

I do not have kids. But not all of the sculptures look toddler friendly, so keep an eye out on your young ones, if they tend to run fast towards sculptures."
"Small park with lot of bench and shade, in the morning lot a commuter walk by to go to Sherbrooke metro. At lunch good place to eat in the shade on a park bench. The Fontaine is nice, it bring a white noise and chill. Cop manage to get the legendary punk community that gather there every summer out of the park for the past couple year. The local hobo still go there for a beer. At night it's a bit romantic if you can ignore the stoner and the beer drinking hobo. It's very safe as most park in Montreal.
Lot of pigeons and squirrels. Its illegal to feed them but the elderly community of the neighborhood make sure there well feed!
Not great for kid. Gravel path."
"Even more beautiful with the snow. Very nice laid-back park with colorful, quaint homes that give it a nice back drop"
"One of the most beautiful picturesque parks on the Plateau. Beautiful  gilded gold and
green iron fountain resembling your typical fountains you'd find all throughout Paris! A place to chill and and take in at all the different and interesting people walking and hanging about in this old bourgeois neighborhood surrounding this fountain."
"Very European, very French. This place is beautiful, peaceful, quiet, as has got some character to it. We enjoyed the environment and also played with pidgins and cute squirrels at the park."
Great relaxing park with tons of benches to read or just chill by the pond
"A good park with a nice fountain and plenty of benches. No tables though, just benches. But my wife and I have had lunch on the bench, so we are proof that it is doable üòÖ There's also a coffee shop in case you need something to drink or some small snacks."
"Peaceful and picturesque place, remind France."
Very nice park/walk way in the city.

Nice little square with trees and Parisian vibe. Has a cute little coffee shop to get some coffee and pastry and watch the squirrels run around. Don't feed the squirrels! The are too fat already.
Very romantic place at night in the summer... beautiful fountains. Nice place to bring a bottle of wine and some food!!!
Its a nice frame to take photo with the colored buildings in the back..
"Not only is this place sublime, the neighborhood is full of charm, the colorful houses are magnificent, but enjoying this beauty under the snow is priceless!"
"Quiet in heart of lower Plateau. Lots of public seating, and weird people to watch. Well treed for shade so grass is not as nice as it could be. Close to lots of little cafes for a little outing."
It's a nice park and unless you're driving past the punks won't bother you during the summer.
Beautiful and peaceful Mtl landmark.
Its a nice small park surrounded by beatiful houses of Montreal.

Victorian row houses are beautiful! Looked like an art set of a movie üëå
Nice little park with a nice fountain! Another near getaway in a busy city! Love walking there when im in my way home!
"Always in love with this square, so typical of the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood and of Montreal's French heritage.
Park near the area and walk up and down Prince- Arthur and Milton streets, to end up in this magnificent square. During summer, the fountain refreshes your senses, and the parlor opens to sell ice cream."
Pretty quaint little parc but only a stop for the main commercial artery of eastern Montreal
Great place to relax and to enjoy some nature
"A beautiful area with large trees, statues and a fountain. The presence of a cafeteria in this so-called park makes it a good place to spend a few moment with friends."
You can find a lot of friendly squirrels here.
"The most Montrealer place in Montreal! If you're planning to come to Montreal for the first time, start your trip on this cozy little square. All the rest will make much more sense!"
Lovely park with a small coffee croissants shop
Beautiful park in the centre of the city
Nice colored house. I prefer the purple one.

"Charming small park, lots of benches. Sometimes has a bunch of weirdos/hobos yelling in the middle of it."
"Where many would say Quebec's Quiet Revolution began in the 60's. Take a break from the city and enjoy the fountain, the flowers and the squirrels surrounded by charming fin de siecle residential architecture."
"If you want to visit Europe without leaving North America, you could do worse than getting a coffee and reading a book in this adorably sophisticated little park."
Good
"Nice little urban oasis frequented by all people, with some old architecture townhouses surrounding it"
Really nice spot to take photos during the summer near the fountain and surrounding colourful houses. Really beautiful around sunset. Then you can walk over and have a nice dinner or shopping nearby.

Great place just to sit and watch the people go by.
My favourite park. Walk. There every day on week ends.
"Quaint old part of montreal, sitting minutes away from ""Broadway"" type of street. Very European like colors, close to eateries. Parking on street is challenging. The ""square"", a park like setting has a fountain that kids would enjoy, but unfortunately was inoperable due still extreme cold temperatures when we visited."
Calm place to hang out in the summer.
Fond memories of decades past and great atmosphere since renovation
"One of my favourite places to relax when you‚Äôre out on a romantic walk up St-Denis. Sit down, relax, have a drink and listen to the fountain."
Square Saint-Louis is one of the nice and quiet parks in Montreal. It leads to Prince-Arthur pedestrian street to connect two of the most commercial streets in the city: Saint-Denis and Saint-Laurent. There‚Äôs a Bixit station at the South-West corner.
Great skate spot. No kick out
"Central fountain lovely with benches, an engaged small city park in a Euro style, summer kiosk, strolling enjoyers, charming on warm nights"

"This used to be crack head park. It'st way nicer now. Still the occasional homeless drunk, but way better than before"

Lovely park!
Very pretty homes. Easily accessible by bus or train. Nice place to bring your lunch and enjoy the view. Very serene and peaceful. Great for pics
Bunch of people smoking weed and playing guitar and playing pokemon go. Its a vibe
"A nice small park with lots of squirrels, they'll walk right next to you if you stand still as well. There's pidgeons that do the same and it's a great place to sit down and talk with a friend. Only issue is the fountain that is empty during fall and winter, I'm guessing early spring is the same case. It's near the sherbrooke metro station which is practical."
"Several years ago, I went to Pier et Dom BB. It was so couzy!! It is one of the places I'll never forget!!"
Shady at times. But nice piece of park in the middle of it all.
Place is near city centre.
Perfect spot to read a book

"Wonderful place with a lot of trees and 2 or 3 beautiful pieces of art, with a large beautiful fountain that enlights the park, sadly a weird woman spoiled my visit there"
Very cute rooms that are clean and tidy with all the essentials. Also in a prime location in old Montreal close to many shops and restaurants within a 3 minute walking radius! We definitley would come back!
One of the cutest places in Montreal. Specially in the summer.
"The park is really beautiful...
It's also a monument."
Pretty park in the plateau. Completely inaccessible in the winter though.
Benches to spend time enjoying the sights and the sunshine.
"The coffee, ice cream and tea pavilion is open for the season! Grab your cup, borrow some book they propose from the rack and go enjoy the Montreal warm weather. Nearby you can find a lovely French bakery Clafoutis for a fresh sandwich. Only minus are a squirrels."
a few pretty houses and a nice place to sit but nothing special really

Very pleasant place to get relaxed!!
"An oasis of calm, with fat friendly squirrels. Don't feed them!"
Nice place to hang out during summer
"Photographic paradise. Whether for street photography or for fall foliage, architecture or feral animals. The usual itin√©rants mean one has to keep a watch for dangerous behaviour but in general locals and visitors alike get on very harmoniously. The lively painted colours of nearby buildings mean even the greyest day can be brightened by a quick visit. Near to Sherbrooke metro station  also makes this a great spot for flying visits."
"Great small square, nice architecture around it."
"Soooo cute, great place to sit, lots of locals just relaxing. However I've had a few unpleasant experiences there with people bothering me."
Coffee place opens during summer. Wifi hotspot. Nice fountain that quiets the cars a little. Sweet spot to have a calm moment or hang out.
Nice square next to busy streets. The buildings here are nostalgic

"Beau, mais le jardin laisse √† d√©sirer."
üòôü§ó
"I didnt visit this place, I was stuck in traffic beside it though. From that perspective it's ok i guess"
It is the worst park I 've ever I visited in Montreal.very dirty and I unmaintained place. the city promised to be maintained but they did not do anything.
I had to leave this city for over 10 years to come back really appreciate these green spaces in the city
Ok
Nice
Beautiful park.
"Nice park, but nothing new about it."
very clean
"Very bad park, no service, herbs are growing every where."
Small park where you can enjoy some paintings.
Nice and calm park
Nice small neighborhood playground. Very clean
This park is historic. Great and safe ambiance for the children.
"Nice little spot in Little Burgundy. Very family-friendly. Swings, slides, and two play structures."
A bit undeveloped but not bad for a quick swing for babies!
"Very clean, child friendly and fenced in."
nice small park with few rides for kids.
Convenient neighborhood playground. Closed for many years due to lack of funding.
perfect place for kids!
Park for kids to play
Fun place to acc√®s the river on snowshoes.
This park is very beautiful. There is a playground area for children. The swings are brand new.  Highly recommended.
Nice place to sit and enjoy the view. Bring your kids to play fishing during the summer.
Great outdoors facility
Nice place
Very calmi g
Nice view
"Good atmosphere here. In the summer almost daily the park is packed with competition, games of basketball are being played and many parents bring there kids to play in the park on the swings and such. This is one of my go to spots to train calisthenics."
This pool looks like it contains pathogens it's so dirty! Like why not drain the water while I leave the filthy water in there?
"Great park! I was able to charge my car while eating my falafel pita.
There were some teenagers knocking around on the basketball court, families out walking, dogs tearing around with their owners. This is a nice place."
The pool is very clean and lovely. I enjoyed from swimming and sun during the current summer. The pool is not crowded most of time.
Very big park with good facilities.
"The pool is very chlorinated, to the point that my eyes stung just being with 15 feet of it. Otherwise, great park.

Has a basketball area, tennis area, bocce ball area, and an outdoor skating rink. Some standard park jungle gym type area, and a kiddie water area.

Very clean, lived in the area 6 years and have never seen more than a couple pieces of trash, which is amazing in this neighborhood."
Great park. Clean pool its free. Sprinkler park. Tennis courts basketball courts skate park. Surveillance. Winter outdoor skating.
"Great pool, it's free. Opens later or earlier depending on the weather. Would be nice if most days it opened before 1pm. Great park, kids have a great place to go."
"Great little park for the community. Basketball court seems to be used quite frequently and the skatepark was once more popular than it is. I think it even has a legal graffiti wall which I think is a great alternative to tagging the cabane in the middle.

Even though it says no dogs, I have never seen it to be a problem as cops drive by constantly"
"Skate park is okay, there's a park for young children and one for older. A very small water park with wayer geysers for hot summer days."
Many amenities skating rink water game public pool tennis court basketball court wow
nice soccer field. you can reserve with the ville st piere
The best park for this small community. Great infrastructure!
"this is the best pack, you can find all you need~"
Park pool sprinklers lots of fun for the kids
"Nice park with an outdoor swimming pool and water game for children a skateboard ramps and hokey plus a basketball and tennis court, facing is a large soccer field and an arena and if in a mood there is a library."

Nice park
Cool
Decent size park for the area
It not far for chateaguay people
Piscine ouverte pour le grand bonheur du public
"Parc Judith-Jasmin is a charming neighborhood public space that impresses with its beauty. There are three rocks that are placed in such a way as to convey the mystique of a Zen garden. If you are walking by or if you just need to relax, make sure to visit and relax on oen of its benches."
Such a good place to relax and take a nap while kids are playing together
"Beautiful park nicely located in the heart of Outremont. The small lake and the fountain give it a nice ambiance, and the large trees provide several shaded areas for the sunny days. There is also a small fenced playground for kids to stretch out."
Clean park. Playground for kids. There's also a small artificial lake and a veteran's memorial for WW1 and WW2. It can get crowded when the weather's nice. The public rest rooms are not always reliable tho. Especially during this covid era.
"Nice park but they really don't take care of the grounds that well. For a place like Outremont, this is dissapointing. They should also put signs banning kids from going into the pond. The water must be filthy. Then again, this is a parents responsibility."
"I went early on a Saturday morning to spend some ""me-time"" with my little journal and hula hoop. Had a great time üôà"
"Nice, calm and peaceful. Not many tables, but blanket on the grass does it. Keep in mind that as there is water ... there are mosquitoes !"
Montr√©al a beautiful city and this lovely park is a good example! A wonderful park for kids!
"Lovely city park with water features.
Best part was fenced playground for kids, gave me peace of mind while relaxing near the water."
Very nice spacious park with a playground and a magnificent scenery. It is next to a school meaning kids can have fun there during lunch.
A little oasis in Outremont. Playground and a beautiful fountain.
Best hidden (not so hidden) gem park in Montreal.
"A beautiful park with an upscale vibe and of good size. Lots of kid friendly things, a ping pong table and chess tables. Would have rated 5 stars, but some areas have garbage, muddy areas, and need to be cleaned. Lots of wasps and wasp nests as well, fear for kids' safety as they run and tumble in the park. I had to leave because I am phobic of wasps."
This is our happy place... the best kept secret of outremont parks.
Nice fountain at this park
"Great park. Busy in the mornings because several preschools use it, but a nice quiet park over lunch time. Great for picnics. Great for kids. Bring sand toys!"
"Stunning place in the winter and summer in the winter there is winter festivals in the summer you can go biking,picnic...."
Super relaxing!
Absolutely beautiful..like every park we have visited since we've been here

Very calm and peaceful. Good for family and picnics
"Beautiful and lush in summertime. Lively with a lot of people on a Sunday, without feeling crowded or noisy. Quiet in the sense that you can read a book here undisturbed (many do). It feels like a mini Central Park minus excessive tourists. Worth taking a break here if you happened to be nearby. Wish there‚Äôs a similar place near me."
Is nice relaxing place and great to take portraits.

"March 14th 2019: Parc outremont used to be a nice place for wedding picture taking. Now, many years later, with all the renovation done, and the last time I went there for a photoshoot... it seems that ""everything"" changed and it's not the same as before... but I didn't stop to take pictures. I went to Rapid Parks instead. However, I will go back there and take pictures of the place to show you guys how it is. Not so beautiful as before I must admit."

"This park is considered to be big in Roxboro, with a few mini soccer fields and playground. Benches were built by the side with one dedicated to Mr Gray. I would like to learn more about the stories behind. Please tell me."
Good for kids
They really need to cut the grass and get rid of weeds.
"This park will satisfy users of all age. No matter what is your purpose of visiting, you will be happy. May it be a picnic, walk, bike , walk, play a sport, going to a playground, to escape the heat in a splash, listen to the bird singing, reading a book or doing outdoor training, all are good.
This park still growing. I saw city workers preparing landscaping by the side of the new tennis court and new basketball court.
Thumb up to the city of Ville St Laurent."

Further, there is parc 2 and can be reached by walk or vehicle. This has a restroom and fun installations. Overall, a highly recommended park."

"It is great park with a dig walking area and a playground for children. Currently, it is not fully accessible as there is a sick fox in the area.  Hope they catch him soon and treat him humanely.  Great place for a picnic or a work lunch as well!"
Love this parc for soccer ‚öΩ

Park is okay but clearly not taken care of. No double gates for entering and leaving the dog park. No running water to clean dogs or let them drink.

Its clean
There is water
Lots of benches
If u forget ur bags there is a box with bags for u to use

üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Tranquil place to rest.
"Walk this place almost daily, year 'round. I tend to avoid in the summer as it is full of people and they litter the place it is unbelievable. Early morning or late at night is a great time for walking your doggy and there is no one and you can unlawfully unleash it and have it have a few good runs or  play with other members of its speecie. Makes happy tired dogs, they appreciate."
"The park is wonderful for short and long walks, cross-country skiing and other activities around the year."
Beautiful area
My kids love this place
Nice
Beautiful and safe park to walk through

Nice view and lake too . But should have opened the washrooms and fountains. Ugh

Very beautiful parc.
Cute lil peaceful 70 yr old Parc with ducks & geese but watch where you walk cuz of geese droppings. üëåüò¨üåûüçÅ
Amazing place to chill very relaxing with birds and nature!
Nice place to be in!
"Aggressive canada geese, bites your fingers off when feeding.

10/10 would come regularly."
My favorite parks üíô‚ù§
Amazing park! Equipment is great with lots to do and a soft material ground to avoid injuries. Water park is fun with lots to do. Last but most exciting is the beautiful manmade pond with all the ducks and their babies and FRIENDLY CANADIAN GEESE! They eat from your hand!
Always fun to play there!
Very nice‚ù§Ô∏è
Good park
"Really this is what this park is called? Everyone I know calls it Central Park.
Besides that, it's a nice place and there's ducks that (I believe) come out of their own free will... And snacks from the visitors."
Fairly large park and quite nice. Lots of room for groups to come and play pick-up sports or walk around. Playground for kids as well.
‚ù§Ô∏èüåàü§üüèºüòé
We shared the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST to the lost over 700 people came out to heare the GOOD NEWS
This park was brought to my attention while I was doing physiotherapy. The trail has exercises along the way and a cute little pond with a bridge. Very serene place.
"Too many children running around in tennis and skate park areas, they should be self contained to recreational park equipment and water park.
No park guards which would help keep the park more organized and less fights would break out.
Cop station in the park but no one drinking booze or causing problems ever gets caught.

Potential to be an amazing park, buts lacks a lot of the necessary components."
It's a nice place to go walking around the park!and amost every week-end there a party or some thing at that park of St.Leonard.
It was citizen's day in the borough of St. Leonard. Full of activities for kids. Too many people but was very enjoyable.
Nice park with the OSM classic music
"A very nice garden to have a walk
With ducks (in the summer )"
"It's a wonderful clean park. It's a little crowded on weekdays late afternoon during the school year but it's a great park for kids to play. They foam like ground ensure kids don't get hurt when they fall, sperated in 2. Youve got the toddler playground and the older kids playground. There's even a little water playground that opens late spring. Next to that there is a gated are separated in two, one side for the tennis players and the other for the skateboarder. A little further there's a nice little path that goes around a little lake and there are ducks and fishes to see. There are plenty benches and grass areas with trees and even some outdoor tables. For those who want to work out for free, they have a bug handful of outdoor exercise fixtures."
This park is part of a bike path so I pass by every few days. Sometimes it's messy because people tend to leave their garbage around. It's sad because there's nice ducks in the pond.
"While walking with my mom in summer, there was a dead cat that was half burried by some kids since there was a homemade Croix. The parc would be so nice if it wasn't such a mess and trash all over."
Great scenery for wedding photo shoots
"Very small park, but cute for very little walks."
Relaxing place...so wonderfulüëçüèª
"Nice greenery, water attracts ducks, canada geese."
Enjoy some family time

Super Big Place. Great for a picnic. Water park / splash park
"Great Parc,not alot of shade & not enough benches or picnic tables"
Newly renovated park with something for children of all ages
Perfect park located downtown Montreal. It‚Äôs gated all around. The splash pad is also gated and separate from the park. There are two full playgrounds and sets of swings (one for babies and the other children & adults). One has sand and the other wood chips). It‚Äôs clean and located in a good neighbourhood. My toddler is a runner and this is the only park I actually find is safe for him to play at .
Nice place to just chill out
Awesome park and good for all age groups. However could get much better than this.
Lovely little park with high-quality playground. It‚Äôs pretty crowded on weekends when the weather is nice.
It's a nice park.

Pretty cool in the morning and full of life but really scary at nightüò®üò®
The basketball courts are the best
"Lovely park, great gated playgrounds for all ages. Will be really stellar once the splash pad is completed!"
This is a really great spot to spend a few minutes exploring and walking around. You are steps away from some of the best shopping and local restaurant destinations the City of Montreal has to offer. Can't we all use a few minutes of calm in the midst of hustle and bustle? Be sure to check out some of the Canadian history found within the monuments here. You'll have to look up from this Google Review though. Enjoy
Love this
"The park has been renovated very good for the kids. I love the fact that it's close to the library, and in the Summer there's so much going on at that park. Movies' casting... Community festivals, all free kids parties, softball games... Etc.

Baseball
"I went today to walk my mom in her wheelchair. Nice walkway includes training sports.

Excellent Park

"Unfortunately money was all spent on a sidewalk around the park frequently empty.
BUT they cut the budget in cleaning it. Emply liquor bottles, Masks, gloves McDonald wrappers etc... This park needs constant cleaning. Many people go through this park and children play in the kiddie corner of the  park."
Very event for the family today. I had fun with my son and the rest of the family
"This park hosted family day yesterday. If u see any pics, that was just for the day."
Park was full of garbage and food wrappers on the floor.  Very disappointed that people litter when there is garbage cans all around.
Great view
Friendly environment
Well done.
Nice little green space between busy roads
Very nice. Never full of people. Nice to just sit and talk.
"It isn't really a park, but a beautiful greenspace with benches and paths. Not really family friendly, as the location as tons of car traffic, but lovely for sitting."

Reminiscent of village festivities in Europe!"
"super clean park. good place to bring your kids and in the summer they hold a couple of italian festivals. juat remember to bring cash if there is food. as parks go its green, a place for your kids and alot of tables to simply take in the sun"
"You will find everything in that park from a pool to a basketball court to a skating ring , love this park it's calm and refreshing"

Very nice park!!!
"Fun for kids, they have toys in place for children to play with"

Great par 3 course.
Good price for the range and golf course seems well maintained.
Fun 9-hole although the greens were in very rough shape
Love the driving range and the staff is very nice.
"Amazing place to practice. 9 holes par 3 + a driving range. Super cheap, especially with Acces Montreal card"
"Not a long walk away from the green line metro, nice driving range at reasonable prices and not very packed most days, happy I found it :)"

"It was my first time on P√®re Marquette Park, and I was impressed by the quality of the facilities, the number of toys in the playground and the pretty thorough water jets, splashes and fountains. There were lots of kids and they were all having fun.

The park also has an extensive green area with many tables for picnics. There's plenty of space to rest and enjoy some peaceful time. Very recommended."
"Skate park  dog park, kids playground, lots of places to picnic or  hang out while social distancing. What Else could you want. A great place to spend a couple hours."
Place is awesome during summer and super crowded. Bring you BBQ and toast it up ‚ò∫Ô∏è The only downfall of this pack is the lack of proximity commerces or local shops.
"Great place to take the kids and perfect for daycare groups. There's a fenced in sand area with a slide, swings, jungle gym, and a wooden ship-like structure. Also has picnic tables. Great splash pad just beside it during the warmer months. Both were renovated in the last two years."
"It is a great park with many features like picknick tables, sprinklers for kids, large play areas and clean washrooms. We went there for mother's Day and had a great time. You are a hop away from great coffee shop."
"Large park
Many outdoor lights for night
New skateboard area"
Nice unique module for kids
"Really nice place to hangout, you can bring your kids as well. Super relaxing."
Big parc in Montreal. Good to meet your friends and arrange a picnic. I saw a bunch of people playing some games and the kids in the water park. Across the street there is a skate area and a football field.
"A park of two halves. The mounds on one side are somehow very pleasant to sit on - many people agree, and it's a popular meeting spot. The skatepark looks fun, and on the other side of the road the wide-open lawn is good for chucking an ball around, and the children's play area is new and also looks fun."
"Nice park in a nice area, the ground is not so even may cause injuries for some players..."
Great park loads of things to do
"Clean, great brand new skatepark and other sports court available."
"Great park, lots of different activities!"
Nice place to get outside
Really nice and large parc. Toilets water games for the kids and a lot of sports fields
"Clean and relatively calm, great place to take a good break."
Lovely area where you can enjoy family time. Also a water park and dog park.
Really beautiful place has a lot of different areas including a volleyball field.
"Wide open spaces with something for everyone. Plenty of mature trees, rolling green hills and foliage in the summer. Excellent splash pad for the kiddies on one end, skate park for the young at heart on the other. Only thing lacking is a proper crossing between the park's two halves. Think twice before dodging cars with the little ones - might be why they stationed cop cars there last time we went."
Great park. Apparently great place to practice your nunchucks skills
Huge park. Something for everyone. Even a skatepark.
Nice stake park
"Great park for activities, however, I wish there were more trees."
Nice park
It is a good place for children to practice skate skills. Coaches are very warm and kind.
"This park have a lot of things. A lot of space for diferents sports, dog park, water park for kids..."
"Lot's of improvement in the past few years. Very sport friendly now. There is a skate park, baskett ball court many soccer field. In the winter you can even go and play hockey! A good park if you like to be active. Very kids and dogs friendly so it fits a rock and roll life style."
Rrally clean with all the service to enjoy the day there.
Great place for family picnics. Great water park.
"Whish there was some spot covered at the skatepark, on a sunny day it is burning."
one of the best skateparks in tge city
Used to play soccer here 15 years ago. It's a great Parc for everyone; kids and adults being kids at heart. Come and relax.
Peaceful oasis in the city. Dog park with friendly people. Large frisbee field. Shady trees. Water play area for children.
Cozy
"Clean, nice dog park, a few benches and paths for walking. Across the street from a skate park and school. Not too far from the Rosemont metro 10-15 min walk)."
"Great park with tons of family friendly things to do. The water park is fantastic for small kids, and has covered picnic tables that are great for birthdays and hanging out with the  kids and friends. There's a skatepark, soccer fields, baseball diamond, and tons of green space to sit under the sun on lazy summer days! One of the better parks in the city."
Nice for family.
"Great park with great vibes, two soccer fields one for adults and the other for younger people. There‚Äôs also a skateboarding park, it is really cool üòé and beautiful, I love it. The trees üå≥ too are wonderful. It‚Äôs an amazing green land."
"One of the most beautiful park in town. Skatepark, soccer fields, baseball field, kids playground and there‚Äôs also a nice ping-pong table. Lovely crowd too!"
Great urban recreation space in the midst of a great city providing so much for the youths.
A good place for children to play on the water
saw a dog die?
"I grew up around this park......it made my childhood. It's got a swimming pool and a wadding pool for children 1 to 6. An indoor  hockey rink and gym . Outside there is a playground for toddlers and older children too. A hill for winter tobogganing.  A community garden is also available.......A great local park. In fact, I believe property values are probably higher around this park. A great place to raise your children........."
"Nice fields for playing soccer but they are getting firm. It's nice to have a chemical toilet (portable toilet) but it needs to be cleaned or emptied sometimes. The odor is pungent all around it.

The main soccer field has needed new or more lights for years. Every time we play there it is difficult to see the ball on the wings and in the corners."
You can drink beer at 6 am 11/10 would get drunk in the morning again
Awesome place in a heat wave!
nice park
The sprinklers are great for young kids. A lot of cool stuff and a section for babies. The playground is a little disappointing but good enough and has a baby section
"Fantastic park. Lots of space and has a community, family, group feel to it. Easy to find a place to relax or have play with friends and family.  Easy to get by bike"
Clean park !
Nice skate park and water park area
"very big park, great place to relax during the summer it has 3 sport field and a huge recently renovated skate park!"
"Good park, to bad they let 2 year old walk around the skate park, Great skate park for beginners"

"Great park, especially if you have kids or dogs. Good luck finding parking though."
"Awesome park full of dogs, athletes and families"
"Great local park. Skating rink in the winter. Skate park, volleyball court, boules, baseball field, soccer field, basketball court what more do you want?"
Small but cozy park
"Love this park so much. Green, spacious, calm."
"It's great! There's a skate park, baseballdiamond,soccer field.,and you can bring your bbq"
"Outdoor ice rink has a lot of people playing, and the ice quality was great. They have an ice on the side for those who just want to skate and not pass the puck."
Very nice gym . very good show for kids
"Excellent to play any game, to relax,  to enjoy ....."
"This park has great potential for the children living near by although it is not adequately laid out. It's divided in three sections and the southernmost is separated by Boulevard Rosemont where cars tend to speed. Crossing lights will be a great way of improving safe access to the park.
Installations could be improved or used differently. Baseball diamond is a total waste of space.
Sliding slope could be made just a bit higher for greater fun during winter time.
What's good: playground for kids, football pitches (artificial), swimming pool (indoors), skate park and upcoming pataugeoire.
What's missing: trees & shade, picnic tables, trekfit installation (this is a must have for this park)."
"One of the few clean place to skate in town, and close to the water to enjoy the view !"
Nice place for big group.
"Huge parc with lof of play grounds: soccer, football, skateboarding  ... used as School yard too may be the reason why no noticable restroom"
"Have indoor hockey rink and a nice pool, among other things."
The pool is nice. Theres a kids pool next to it so smells can be strong Mahh ma
Good game structure for the kids. Same Parc houses and interior pool and wadding pool for the toddlers.
"Really Nice Park, so Big with all you need (dog Park, football baseball and basketball field, area for kids to play)"
"Huge park from many activities: soccer fields, bball courts, skating park, etc."
"Nice park, different space to walk, run, play soccer or frisbee. The park is not too crowded so everyon can have their space."
Super!

Great place for a stroll.
You'll always find someone playing soccer... from everywhere in the world!
üëç
Nice space to play with kids but not enough trees
"The flow is good, can be really crowded."

"Another Montreal park, not the best one, but still a nice chunk of green"

Magnifique parc. La ville devrait cependant offrir des toilettes surtout en p√©riode de COVID.
üëçüëçüëçüëç
Not a park... unless 3 trees and a patch of dead grass is a park...
It was  beautiful and relaxing
Beautiful big park where every day there's people enjoying life and all sorts of activities.
"Beautiful park, clean and fresh air all around it. I wish there were signs in English too a little difficult as I do not speak French. Also I wish people should not smoke in the park."
"This is the biggest park I've been so far in Montreal. It has a water with beautiful ducks playing in it and benches to sit next to them. The place is huge, with courts for tennis, and other sport activities. I live this place. I've heard people express their joy about this place, and I was impressed to experience it. Definitely going there from time to time"
This park is beautiful. My favourite place to sit and get some sun on a lazy Saturday afternoon. There is some construction this year so the fountain is not on and the lake around it is drained but there are duckies on the other side.
Extremely powerful. This Parc has immense energetic properties. A good place for those trying to connect with the cosmic web ü§ç
Just beautiful and has everything.  Even bike training space :) ice-cream shop is just next to it
One of the most beautiful parks in the city. Great outdoor space.
"Great park, lots of green space to bring a blanket and have a BBQ. Currently, there is construction ongoing on the amphitheatre."
"One of my favorites parks in Montreal, the small lake has a good effect specially on sunny day.
Beautiful atmosphere and i notice that lot of young people here, and less families."
"A beautiful place to just sit and relax, in the heart of the city. It's really beautiful during the autumn season with lot of benches and cozy grass sit on. The lake is very peaceful in the summer with ducks floating around. It becomes an ice rink in winter. During summer and fall, there are lots of bixi stands around the park. Also you won't have trouble finding a parking spot. For those who prefer metro Sherbrooke is the closest."
"Kinda crumby under construction area, but mostly calm and relaxing park. Good shade options and traffic separation."
Nice green space in the heart of downtown.  Mostly well maintained but looks like there is some construction going on by the lookout.
"La Fontaine Park presents a gorgeous snowy scene to us in winter.

Snow is the gift that winter gives us. Not only our human being, but also all living things embrace snow, like these trees in the Park. Snow make them graceful. They are dancing in the wind."
"Awesome Park, Very Well Designed and Well Maintained!!"
"The second park in town, its‚Äô vibe is certainly different season by season, and the weather certainly plays a role in whether this place is traversable or not, but it‚Äôs good for a picnic or a walk around, and there are bathrooms that aren‚Äôt terrible. The ducks really make the place for me. Unfortunately they aren‚Äôt a permanent fixture of this spot."
"It's an amazing park, you have available tables or you can sit in the grass during summer, make BBQs, walk your dogs and many more"
It's one of the most famous parks in Montreal. Very lively....have some wonderful eateries near the park.
"Great experience. Security is not the best someties, but I love the place"
"This park is amazing all in one.
Picnic benches, sports and exercise areas, small pond, dog park. :)
Just go and do what you want."
La fontaine parc.was.exceptional  the most amazing part was the middle aged asian man picking up cans and telling ua interesting background stories very wholesome 10 out of 10 would recommend
It is one of the greatest parc i'v been. The only reason why i did put 4stars was because  it was really crowded because of its popularity.
"A great park to expend time with your family and friends, it has a beautiful artificial lake and plenty of space to room around"
"Great park for picnics and out door activities (jogging, biking & walking) ideal for families."
Picnic vibes. Fun place to be. Can't wait until summer!
"Very nice spot, many restaurants nearby. During the winter, the ice is really nice and the space for skating is really big also since the body of water is frozen around that time."
Great park! It's possible to do skating in winter there.
Great place to hangout with friends. Grab a beer and a Frisbee for a good time.
Is packed but respectfully spaced out and the weather is perfect...COME ON DOWN
"The place is calm and when the sun comes up, it is magnificent."
"Beautiful park especially when the pond is filled with water. Plenty of green space as well as recreational areas (tennis courts, soccer pitch, bocce ball, etc.)"
"Structures are old and not maintained very well,  and looks like they only clean it weekdays as trash everywhere and trash cans overfill  .."
"Nice park, lake and playground for all ages. Great for a picnic"
"Ice skating on the pond is great!
The rental shop is closed for lockdown - but the ice is still maintained regularly."
"My favorite park in Montreal, although I was wish was bigger but that's only an issue in summer. So crowded on weekends"
"Here is another very cool lake in the center of Montreal. We hit this one on the way out of town. There was no problem parking and getting access to the park.

There is a large lake and many pathways to wander around. They have a large number of benches and grassy areas to sit and enjoy the tranquility. It makes you forget you are in a big city."
Lafontaine park is a large enough park that you can really enjoy strolling around quite a large distance. You can always find a socially distant place to sit and relax.
Beautiful park with pleasant ambience..nice peaceful place to hangout with friends and family
Awesome place! One of the Best Park in Montr√©alüòç
Middle of downtown and full of people.  Not enough benches.  Avoid if you can and drive to a better park.
Loke the place.  a lot of people playing.  it is a fun place to be
"Exactly what you'd expect: a park with numerous park-like features. Lots of characters and wierd people, a bit of a Westworld MTL edition vibe. Great park simulation, I give it a 5/7"
"A great walk, a beautiful view, from which I am in favor of limiting buildings to increase that height."
I enjoyed every bit of my time there.
Currently under construction but still a really nice place to sit and have a picnic!
"Very spacious, very nice spot for nature and always busy now."
Beautiful Montreal park with ponds and lovely trees and peaceful spots to sit on a blanket with a friend or loved one. Not overly populated and lots of different little pockets for all kinds of park lovers.
"Beautiful trees, much flowers, clean table available for lunch."
"THE parc in Montr√©al to have a typical Montr√©alers evening, best place to hangout and have a relax time while watching ducks and enjoying a good stroll around"
Amazing place to be with friends.. Family.. Love ones
There is a beautiful lake and great playground.
"Beautiful in the summer, magical in the winter. I love coming here."
"One of the greatest larks in mtl, with tenis cours, dog parks and great views, it lacks a few tables and as such, they are taken nost of the time."
Awesome you can bring your BBQ  anytime in the Park üòâüëç
It was nice and a great place to relax after a long week.
"Great parc with a calming atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great place to hang out with some friends, read a book, and play in the snow during winter."
Very nice place to hangout with family and friends. It has a baseball field and 2 volleyball fields.
"Great park, lots of trails and spaces to explore. Try to go there by bike or public transport to avoid parking spot hassles!"
Great place to spend a nice cosy sunny day. A lot of activities going on. You can join any group and can have fun. There is a lake in the middle of the park where you can often spot ducklings. Don't forget to take Frisbee or volleyball with you!
"Nice, big, cozy and full of people with enough space to be at least 2m from everyone"
"a must go. especially on a sunny day.
my only wish is bike rentals :-(
definitely worthwile and easy to get to."
Very calm place to get some fresh air. Nice lake with pubble on the bottom. Lots of nature in a fast pace city like Montreal. Several walkways to enjoy with your toddler. Well managed park.
Good place to have a picnic
Great place to spend some time with family. Kids will definitely enjoy this place. You could easily spend about 3 hours here provided if the weather permits.
"Beautiful park in the heart of Montreal! Its beauty is at its peak in Autumn, but a great place to take in greenery any time of the year."
It was very nice and relaxing !! Enjoyed the really nice weather and sun üåû ~
It has a good multi player tennis court
"Super nice lake summer or winter, you can easily pass half day here on the lawn with the sun."
Loved it. Something for everyone to do. Loved the different areas and the water bodies. Enjoy the ducks!
"This is a beautiful park. There's plenty to see and do here. Lots of benches, trees, paths, and more. There's a large pond in the park that's worth walking around. La Fontaine Park was the last place I visited during my weekend in Montreal on Canada Day weekend and it was a fantastic way to cap it off."
"Great time ice skating with my work family, it's a nice park and very open."
"Love this place! A enough-sized green park where you can go to do whatever you want from taking the sun, have a meal with your mates or why not  play different kind of games. Lovely sunsets and  breathtaking views."
"That park really has some views. I must confess that even after 18 months that I visited it I can't stop thinking about it.

I know that many would say that Parc La Fontaine is like any other park but for me is really special.

I would love to spend every second of my weekend reading alongside the small pond within it.

God i miss Montreal"
Easy parking and nice park. Will go again.
Very nice place to walk and take the kids to play
Beautiful place. Be relax and take deep breath. Enjoy the natural beauty.
"I‚Äôve lived next to this park for 3 years and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favourite in Montreal.

SUMMER: There are a lot of benches and cozy grass spots to sit on. The lake is very peaceful and they‚Äôve made efforts to ensure it is cleaner. During the summer, people come here to jog, picnic and hang out.

WINTER: During the winter, the lake turns into an ice rink which really brings a festive touch. The paths are usually well cleared out and the park is particularly peaceful on a sunny day.

ACTIVITIES: There‚Äôs also an outdoor theatre, an indoor theatre, ball courts, tennis courts, baseball courts and other activities in the park. There‚Äôs also a little cafe in the center of the park. Lots of restaurants (of which the famous La Banquise) next to the park.

ACCESS: Lots of bixi bikes along the park and the 24 bus line and the 14 bus line pass by the West side of the park. The closest metro is Sherbrooke.

Only downside in my opinion is that sometimes people leave trash around the park so it makes it look a little dodgy."
One of the best places to enjoy outdoor skating in Montreal. Go early as it gets crowded.
Beautiful in winter as in all seasons. Watching kids and adults skating and tobogganing. Magical!
"It has everything you need from a park, playground, a lake, although the lake is dried out. It's beautiful park in the heart of Plateau-Mont-Royal."
"One of the best parks I have ever been to. There is a beautiful lake, a lot of wildlife, including the biggest amount of squirrels I have ever seen, ducks, seagulls and pigeons. A lot of green spaces where you can just lay down and enjoy life, many available sports to do, benches, statues and even a big dog park. You can see a lot of people doing the most diverse activities in this park, from running to playing music instruments. I definitely recommend that you come here."
Awesome place to go skating with a big ice surface. Skate rental available aswell!
What a great Oasis in the city. You can truly get away from it all in this park. The fountain is wonderful with all the ducks. This park has something for everyone. My only complaint are the homeless people but that is hard to control unless you want cops all around.
Fountain park with a fountain that never seems to be functional... Hahaha classic.
Very nice place for skating....Price is adorable and crowd is good.
Quite crowded at the moment but easy to find a spot where u r at least 2-3 meters away from everyone
Great parc to hang out or picnik in. Do not recommend swimming in the fountain however.
A very nice large park surrounded by lotsa good restaurants. The large pond is completely by ducks! And there's plenty of savage squirrels looking through the trash for leftover bits of delicious poutine. #duckcentral
It's good to relax and enjoy the nature
I live nearby and walk there most days.  It's such a pleasant environment and it's nice to see the changing seasons.
"This park is amazing all the time.
I love it"

Beautiful park with available parking around.
"Very nice Park, but a lot of people!"
It is a beautiful park. It is great for running or walking with the family.
Nice park to visit. You have a small restaurant in the middle of the park. You have a wonderful view to the small lake. I recommend.
It's my go-to suntanning and chilling place.  Don't forget the hidden sangrea backpack cache.
Very nice place
"Located at the foot of Mount Royal, from which Montr√©al is named, is the neighborhood of Le Plateau-Mont Royal.  Accessible via the Orange line at the Mont Royal stop, the neighborhood is charming and features flower and fruit stands, galleries, restaurants, pubs and shops. t's the perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon, enjoying excellent brunches, outdoor seating and people-watching."
"Great and large place
There is many places to do any activities such skateboard, play soccer, playüéæ , or basketball even baseball. It's clean"
"The park is a beautiful place to just sit and relax, even for a moment. It's especially beautiful during the autumn season. There are even ducks that like to visit, for those who like to watch them."
"Amazing spot for families and friends to meet, restrictions applied  following the Covid19  public health guide lines put in place by the health Ministry of Qu√©bec.  Stay safe"
Beautiful pond with a fountain and a little waterfall. Lots of seating by the pond. One of the many beautiful parks in montreal.
"Beautiful park, with many opportunities for sport, kids playgrounds, kids bikepaths, fun and relax. Great place to spend a few hours or even the entire day. I particularly enjoyed the music from an original artist, who created an amazing relaxing atmosphere."
Great place to walk around or skate on pond so big loved it!!!@
"It was so affirming to see masses of people out enjoying independant diverse activities in this beautiful urban park.   There were artists, family picnics, hammocks strung between tres, bbq grills, blankets and everyone from infants to elders."
I went skating but it was nice very not busy in the morning
A beautiful and calm place to spend time with family and friends. Good place for walking. Cycling road around the pond is not good enough.
"Big, clean, and has many nice amenities"
"Best park in Montreal! Really big with a ton of stuff to do, a beautiful lake, a lot of picnic tables and the like to have a BBQ. It's lovely."
"On of the best parks in Montreal. Each are of the park has its own vibe: there's the picnic area, hippie area, cirque area, musicians area, and more. Beautiful place to spend a weekend and relax before summer ends"
"Great place to walk and relax, with beautiful scenery. Enjoy a nice BBQ with your friends (bring ur own mini bbq)...you can also play volleyball, tennis and workout!"
"Great park to walk, run and even sit by the lake by yourself. Really peaceful."
"The ice had a few cracks only, ready to access. Well maintained."
The vibe cannot be beat!
"A huge park, with water body inside. There is running or walking track, several benches to sit. Also nice place to do gatherings in summer.
From kids to olds nice park to visit and spend time."
"Very beautiful park, great for walking and relaxing."
Amazing place to have good time with family and kids. It s so quiet
This is very beautiful üòç in every season in canada
This parc is magical whether you go during day or night it‚Äôs beautiful
"Perfect place where you can pass a great timea after a hard day of work, solo or with friends"
"This place is great for a summer day with the family and friends. People go there to practice sports, have picnics, or just hang out in nature."
A nice big park in the middle of the city you'll probably see duck swimming in the water.
Very pretty. Lots of green space for picnic and walking/biking paths. We usually pick up food from one of the many nearby restaurants and enjoy in the park.
"Very cool place in the middle of the eastern side of Montreal downtown. In General, it‚Äôs very busy. In the winter, there‚Äôs a nice ice rink to try."
I'm taking walks in La Fontaine Park almost daily. There are lots of activities too (for example Tai Chi during summer and ice skating during winter time). Lots of Bixi stations around the park. They have a lake (ducks are cute with their babies ü¶Üü¶Ü). Also they have a restaurant there. A nice place to explore and enjoy.
A wonderful park at the heart of Montreal a lot of people are enjoying a bit of fresh air  here in this park particularly in this pandemic time
"This is a casual, laid back park. There's plenty of greenery, fountains, a pond, and walk and cycle ways that make this a really worthwhile park to visit.

There are different sections that let you play sports, cycle, jog, have a picnic, or just sit back and enjoy.  A perfect place to come when the weather is good and soak up the sun or lay under a tree. Given the different sections, you can choose to be amongst the other park-goers or find a quieter section to yourself."
"Beautiful park. At some point the pond was not filled and it was a little dirty, but they filled it up and it is definitely the prettiest park near downtown Montreal. Beautiful river / lake that you can skate on in the winter. The restaurant seems lovely with nice view on the lake."
It's like Montreal's own central park
"The park all covered in white is just amazing. Beautiful landscapes, a giant ice skating rink above the frozen lake. Great place to spend a funny afternoon in the winter."
"Beautiful natural park around a small lake. Great place for my runs, places to sit, open fields where I saw people doing Tai Chi, martial arts, aerobics and other things. Volleyball courts, tennis courts, and more."
"Parc la Fontaine is a very beautiful park to be at. Extremely big with the beauty of the snow and lots and lots of people enjoying the skating rink. Was a nice way to spend Valentine day despite the espace was closed.
Had an extremely nice time here"
Great playgrounds for younger and older kids
Beautiful nature in a concrete jungle
"Very Nice place to live by ! During spring, summer and fall they host free cultural activities such as movie screening, concert, exhibitions... there's even a theatre at the center of the park."
This is one of the best parks in the city. Amazing place to spend time surrounded by nature and beauty.
Beautiful place to visit in Summer and as well as in winter
Every angle of this place looks good. It should be easy to get into a positive vibe here with such a nice view.
Nice and calm. The early September air was crisp and rather chilly for a late summer evening. Heartening to see a lot of folks being active on a weekday. It was a bit early for the music to kick in the park else I would have hung around a bit more.
"A beautiful park to jog, have a picinic, relax and read books."
Nice paths for taking a stroll.  Skating is available on the rinks and artificial lake.
Great park. Really big with lots of space and a nice water feature. Places are close to get food and drinks also. For sure a good place to bike to and hang out.
"Absolutely beautiful in the autumn season. Very picturesque, just like what you see on postcards üçÅ"
"Quiet and beautiful green space, it‚Äôs great to sit and relax next to the pond. Lots of people enjoying picnics in here!"
When ever you feel no good just go here for an evening... you'll get the best mood
"That place is phenomenal, very good to ride a bike and also to go  for a slow walk."
This park in awesome.
"Nice and quiet park for walk or run
But the best part is Squirrels"
"A beautiful large park of a block size at the corner  Sherbrooke and Papineau Sts and where you can take a sun tan, jog, walk your dog, play tennis volleyball or have a simple picnic. It's a shame that responsible people let it run down: lots of cut floating weed on the water, big hole or uprise on road asphalt around lake, accumulated dirt on corners, deteriorated cement steps covered with dirt and weeds...."
"Beatifull big park to enjoy some nature in the city. There is a lake with ducks, many trees and squirrels everywhere. There are many places to sit, make a picnic ride bikes, etc. There are also sports areas."
"Gotta love beautiful spaces in the middle of a fabulous, busy urban centre. Montr√©al love!"
"Parc Lafontaine is one of the most popular urban parks in the center of Montreal. Its geographical location, not far from the Plateau du Mont Royal, ensures that it will always have a steady flow of revelers. Many families come here to picnic, for a walk around its artificial lake or take a nap in the shade of many of its majestic trees."
Beautiful park suitable for all the family. If you look closely in the pond you‚Äôll see small crustaceans.
Nice place to relax with some ducks and pigeons around..there is a large pond with a small waterfall. There is some construction seen inside but there are many parts of the park where you can have your own time to have a quiet evening
"Great place to run and walk n relax. Although surrounded by busy roads, the park is peaceful n quiet. Even as a dog park. And there is a nice lake with a beautiful fountain."
"The place I called a second home for me. Such a wonderful park in the middle of the city to run, play sports, just hang out with friends and relax. I love this place :)"
"Beautiful and clean park. Lots of space to rest, play or meet others. Enough space for kids to play, and get entertained."
A breathtaking park filled with all kinds of nature!
"Louis Hippolite LaFontaine first premier of lower Canada at a time when James Baldwin of York(Toronto) ruled upper Canada .circa 1792
Originally conceived as Logan Park and opened in 1878 by the Federal Government in Ottawa, the Park name changed in 1947 to better reflect the population of the time. Given as a gift  to the City of Montreal 1990."
"Nice park! It was clearly a local favorite as it was bustling with people from those playing sports, picnicking, and a local festival with a stage. The only issue was not alot of parking nearby and paid parking."
"Nice place for jogging and walking or spending the weekend in. There is a big lake surrounded by fields and benches where buskers perform and people picnic on, as well as a small community centre with art workshops and  access of bathrooms."
Nice place to relax.  Maybe sit by the water and read a book or listen to music...... meet friends and relax on the grass. Great place for it all
So relaxing place quite place clean Park You have a lot of attraction to do I love this place! üòçü§©
"Awesome park, needs help though"
"What a lovely place to have a picnic! So many trees to sit under, and a little kept pond to walk around! Theres a little mini waterfall thats just precious as well.
The squirrels ARE brave and WILL eat out of your hand if attempted. Be weary."
"La Fontaine is one of the largest and most interesting parks in the heart of Montreal. Situated in the Plateau and a short walk from down town, this park is the perfect place to come to cool down beneath the trees on a hot summer's day or warm up while ice skating on a cold winter's evening. La Fontaine has something for everyone - ample space to picnic, beautiful views and luscious gardens to chill in, numerous sports courts (tennis, p√©tanque, volleyball..) and a caf√© by the lake. You won't be disappointed!"
Beautiful park with lots of trails and seating areas!
"This is the hottest club in Montreal during the pandemic. It's got fresh air, trees, p√©tanque and lots of space. You can even bring a friend!"
"Amazing that such an oasis exists in the city. It's a little dated, and the lawns are mostly weeds, but still a green area where people can relax and enjoy nature."
"Beautiful park with a nice lake in the middle - lots of ducks, loons, and herons üëç romantic and serene"
Very nice place to chill with friends
My favorite parc!
The beauty and splendor! Sereen and great for meditation.
We had a good walk around this very attractive park. The only downside was the toilet facilities which were not well maintained. The lake is beautiful with plenty of seating.
"My go to place to chill, workout, play."
Beautiful park with great vibes. Plenty of people chilling out over drinks and a BBQ picnic or simply coming to read. A must see in autumn!
It's a nice park but lots of weird people
Great weather today...
Pleasant park and a nice  lake with ducks situated in centre of Montreal where you can sit by the water by reading book or having fun with family . A walk in the park for while calms your mind . very good for a walk and rent a bike to go around
Great place to walk or x country skiing
It is the same architect who designed Central Park in New York so Yes guys! You should totally stop by and see for yourself! Great park üòç‚ú®
"It was written that us a perfect place for bbq. But as a first visitor, I found it a mess. It was a bbq every where as well as interdiction sign. Very confused and unsatisfy."
Nice park for a walk or to bike around. plenty of place to have a picnic. Clean and safe.
Very nice park.  Very well laid out with an excellent skating rink that is winding through the park and makes for a very nice afternoon event.  There are buildings in which to rent skates and other Winter items to enjoy the park in whole.  Warm beverages are available to keep warm with a nice friendly atmosphere to socialize. If you like Winter sports this is a must visit place when in Montreal.
"Surely one of the most pleasant parks in Montreal. Enjoy a light stroll around the water, sit in the lawn to read a book or stop by to eat a delicious poutine from nearby Banquise"
A perfect park for refreshment
My favourite place to visit all year round.
Beautiful parc in the heart of the city. During winter it's worth it for ice skating with classical music.
"A great place to go! Beautiful landscape, lots of activities. If you want hiking, jogging, relaxing, this is your place!"
Beautiful park and pond. Reminds me of New York's central park but very tiny version.
"Nice park, large enough,  yet it can get super crouded sometimes."
Lovely place to bring a picnic and a bottle of vino on a summer afternoon. Quiet and romantic. Great date location.
Love this park!
Super busy during weekends but definitely the best place to skate in Montreal
Nice big park to walk around in. People seem to be keeping distance and staying within their own groups. Nice big pond with plenty of seating
Pretty much my favorite place to hang out in the entire city.
"Romantic, natural splendor, a haven of peaceful & delightful charm and makes you forget the hustle and bustle of the city around you."
In love with this park...its near my place so I am always walking around there or just hanging around soaking in the sun in the summer.
"If you come to Montreal is autumn in October, you must come to this park to take a look at the beautiful autumn scenery."
Corn ta-das for. You
"Very nice park if you wanna chill with friends or walk around. Very clean, however it can get a little bit crowded. If you are a begginer runner its perfect because is very flat. ü§óü§óü§óü§ó"
Outstanding view and scenery! Would recommend walking about the park to fully grasp the parks beautiful landscapes.
"La Fontaine Park is a beautiful mature park with lots of old hardwood trees, ponds, gardens and more.  A welcome reprieve for many locals year round, but especially during the dog days of summer. A chunk of nature in the heart of the city."
Great and very peaceful place for reading book or listening musics.
"Two types of Tennis courts, plenty of room if you reserve in advance"
In the middle of the island. Good place to spend time. Also has an outdoor pool.
I love the nature but the fountain was closed for construction
"For me, this is one of the most awesome park in all MTL. This is a must ! There is a book called ""La grosse femme d'√† c√¥t√© est en ceinte"", and they talk about the neighborhood  and how the little kids from 1945 gone here to spend their time. Very romantic ! You won't forget its charm."
"It's a big park, go check it out."
Refreshingly young demographic. Seems like a good place for just about anything outdoors
Best park ever.
Great park. A lot of green space with bike route. Near two Bixi stations. You can rest under the trees near the lake inside the park.
Nice.
"It's a beautiful park, albeit tiny, and I love that it exists! Interestingly, I've seen some people swimming with the ducks on a rainy summer night."
Very big park
The Best park in town where your meet people and you practice a lot of sports for free but its hard to park your car.
"The park is wonderfully designed. Personally, I found it very attractive and realxing. You can enjoy a lot of fun and you got plenty of space to do sports also üòÅ"
"Nice place to stay at night :)
The ice looks good, have to get there with some stuff to ice skate :)"
Lovely large urban park with a pond. Large evening gatherings of locals make this a great hang out.
A very nice place especially in sunny days.
I'm born and raised in Vancouver and to have a parc of this magnitude at my doorstep now in Montreal makes it all that much easier to live here. Phenomenal energy.
One of the best parks in Montreal
I love üíï
"Bring a blanket, wine and your favorite meal to spend a lazy afternoon by the water, keeping cool under the trees in summer or  take in the gorgeous autumn colors during sweater-wearing season in the Fall. Huge park to leisurly stroll along the paths and you can even stop and play a bit of petanque if the mood fits ;)"
Great park! Fantastic atmosphere
"Place of positive vibes: great place to mingle and share a glass ""du bier"". Lots of students, artistic souls, politically engaged debates. In short, a must visit place of Montrealaise French speaking community"
"Enjoyed our afternoon there. Quite reviving and lively park. Nice playground for the kids, if you have any."
Place to be you got the water you can bring your kids have a lot of space to got place for your bike have a picnic I have a strictly recommend people to come at La Fontaine Park you got tennis and everything so come on down guys and don't forget to wear your mask thank you
"Squirrels home üòç A good place to have lunch, to take a nap or to walk with your dogo üêï"
"It was alright, but I come from out of country and am use to many more parks and water fronts. Although this park was a neat little place, it wasn't what I was looking for."
"First time there, social distance get together. Definitely going back and will bring a portable bbq."
Nice place to relax
Very nice place near to me
"What a nice place to spend an evening for a quiet little birthday! This is the second option for me to go for my run, the lake and the ducks are a sight and a nice place to relax. I saw people sitting, chilling and reading some books which is definitely you should do if you end up going there. In winters you would end up going there from some sledging and just enjoy the pristine white Montreal snow."
Beautiful place for a nice quiet walk!
"Definitely a nice park to walk in.  Looking for a place to free yourself from negativity, a walk in the park will truly clear up your mind.  Feel the love!"
Nice parc with amazing green view. It's good fot sports and relax as well.
"Beautiful park, very big, there's always lots of people when the weather  is nice but it's easy to find a nice spot. Lots of good eats nearby too."
Best park in Montreal. Very large and family friendly
"Lovely park, never too crowded even on the nicest days. Don't forget to watch for people when you're cycling though."
Beautiful park in the heart of montreal! Needs the water back in the lake buy other then that love it. In this times definitely recommend.
I had such a great time.
"An amazing local park in Le Plateau Mont Royale for a picnic, renting a bike or just enjoying the view by the ponds."
"A beautiful park with plenty of space for everyone to enjoy. Plenty of ducks and squirrels to watch play. There's a big pond in the middle to look over in bliss. Not over crowded ( mid day Friday) and few children made it nice and quiet. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place to read a book, meditate, or just watch life go by."
"Great park, bike , walk , unwind after a tough day. Anything is possible."
"living nearby, so this park is very convenient for my dogwalks...very vibrant and lively, with people doing any kind of sports activities to kid camp's outings, this park offers a little observation point into life of its inhabitants"
Busy but beautiful
One of the many lovely green spaces in Montreal. Great for a picnic or a simple walk.
"It is one of the most beautiful and peaceful parks Montreal has to offer. I love going there for chilling, running, having a picnic with friends, etc."
Loved the park. Perfect for a gathering for special occasions. Lots of benches for bbq and party.
"It's a big park in the middle of the city. I spent lots of time reading, doing picnic there in the summertime. It's really cool. Friends used to do BBQ, and now, during winter, it's beautiful in another way, and lots of people go ice skating."
"Great location, diverse community... well maintained"
"What a nice place.
Beautiful manicured skating surface in a quiet and quaint Montreal suburb.
Lots of boutiques and small shops around depicting the history, charm and culture of this wonderful historic city."
"Great place to go on a sunny sunday. Bring friends, board games and food and it makes for a wonderful picnic."
Beautiful park
My favorite park by far!
Moved here from Vancouver BC 6 weeks ago and it's the most beautiful place. The rad people make it so electric. Montreal people are so dope and positive. Best place to walk my dog and meet fellow muscians. Fav place in  Montreal to relax and zen out
Always fun. Lots of squirrels
"It is among my favorite parks in Montreal. It is beautiful, urban, with great views and nature and has a nice bistro. A must go in a sunny day in Montreal!"
This Park is big with a beautiful landscape. People can sit around the Lake and relax
Dirty ..But you can see cute squirrels
You can not have a better natural habitat accessible within the city! Large area. Velo permitted. Children paradise. A small kingdom for ecureils including a few rare white ones. At times music players!  A view on the artificial water pond.just sit or lay down and relax! Surrounding areas have drinks and food if needed and you can bring at walking distance.smell the 4 seasons and the fresh air. Voila!
Nice park‚Äî well maintained and easy-to-follow paths.
it's beautifull
No parking lol
"Still one of the best place to hang out with your group of friends to eat, to plan a BBQ in familly or to just take a nap after smoking a blunt under the trees in the mid afternoon :)"
"It's a large beautiful park with lots of playgrounds.
Pros:
BBQ allowed
There are 2 lakes and many ducks
Safe
Nice people
Clean public toilets with soap

Cons:
Limited picnic tables
Parking is a major problem (average 5 hours 15$)
Grass level: 6/10"
"Simply good
You feel like not being in the city"
Very nice park with open spaces and a beautiful lake
This is my favourite park in all of Montreal it reminds me of Central park in New York
"I love this place just for go, take a sit and relax. It's beautiful!"
My favourite park in Montreal by far! Very peaceful and relaxing
so peacful
Nice place for chill in the grass in the summer or for ice skating in the winter.
great skating rink for everyone
Always a pleasure chilling in this park. But weirdly enough they don't have a nearby water post to drink from safely unlike mont royal
"I love it so much. I have direct view from my building. It is amazing for picnics, to read a book, to draw. In summer there are festivals. Love it."
Cheerful and peaceful
One of the best park in Montreal with a european touch
"One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal! The trees are majestic, the place is well divided: children's games, water games, soccer fields, baseball, tennis, petanque, volleyball. There is also a dog park.  The ideal place for a picnic or a simple bike ride."
I do cardio poussette there. It is awesome
Great urban oasis. Bring a sandwich and a beverage and watch ducks play in the pond or squirrels scurrying around.
Wow. So nice.. so big. Clean  . Had a great time  . Beautiful park.
"Lovely park, ideal to go with friends and/or family. It's really nice, especially with the lake and tons of places where one can do picnic."
"Wonderful park filled with beautiful and happy people (specially in the summer) great for jogging, meditation, picnic, playing music..."
Little bit aglomerated for my taste...
Doge time !!! Love it
I love this place especially in the automne
"Beautiful parc, widespread with lots of places for social time. Bring your BBQ, your soccer ball or your frisbee and enjoy a fun time in the parc."
Not badüòú
Beautiful park
"This park is the first one I visited when I arrived in Montreal 33 years ago.  It went through a lot of good and bad times, nice and not so nice crowds but the spirit is still there.  It is a great place to hangout, to relax, to play many different sports with friends or simply sit down and enjoy a book or the scenery.  Ponds and waterfalls have been restore, fountains have multicolor LEDs, ducks can chase colored toe nails (just kidding).  It can sometimes be a bit like Woodstock since covid19 outbreak but hey, I don't know anyone complaining about that but the police.  LaFontaine Park is an oasis when heatwaves hit Montreal and everyone would miss it if disappeared.  That's it!  Now go."
"Nice relaxing park for a walk or run. If you don't like squirrels, avoid this place. There are so many here that you almost trip over them, it's fun to see them run around in the trees and play and stuff. They are cheeky though, if you leave your food unattended they will most likely try to steal some :)"
A friend of mine showed me around and we had a great time
"This park is really big with a great little pond and fountain. But it is falling a part in certain areas and needs a good repaving. Also, not really a safe spot for a nighttime stroll. Many drunks and my girlfriend and I were almost mugged... So there's that..."
"It was one of my daily visiting park...very beautiful, indeed!"
"Very nice park, you can easily spend 1-2 hours just walking around. If you get hungry grab a poutine at the corner."
"Great for picnics and to have a good time with family, friends or just by yourself"
"It's gorgeous!!! I loved this park! Definitely a perfect place To have a picnic, to enjoy  doing nothing  , outdoor games or whatever you want! I am sure that is a wonderful place to go  in Montreal! Lots of green and shaded spaces and a lake! What a wonderful surprise!!!!"
Nice ambiance lots of people doing there own thing..
"Probably the greatest park in Montreal. Gripping up next to it was just awesome, summer and winter."
Great park! Was designed by the same person who designed central park in New York!
Once i met a an old guy in a wheel chair and he was a really cool guy... but then i met this other guy in a wheel chair who was also a really cool dude... so i decided to get the 2guys together and see if we could meet up in the park... good times
"Very nice park, lots if room for everyone and amenities to have fun."
Great place if you wanna relax by the water/meditate or just run and exercise on the stairs and you can bring your dog too.
Love place
Chill park. A lot of police monitoring. Nice facilities
"Go here ofter to play beach volley, nice park, good to escape the city life a bit :)"
"Great park, really big, lots of benches, tables, fountains, a lot of trails, all open -lot of trees , no scruffy forest ,lake in the middle, lots of cool people, guitar players, excellent park"
"I absolutely love this park! It's a pefect spot to bring a friend or a lover to spend some quality time together, or simply bring your book and have good time with yourself... and as part of the scenario there are trees, squirrels, people dancing, meditating, practicing sports, kids running around... damn, it's a little relaxing paradise in the middle of the frenetic streets of Montr√©al!
It was during a sunny Summer day

J'ai h√¢te que l'√©t√© prochain vienne nous d√©tendre au parc La Fontaine üíö"
"Best park in Montreal-- Ducks,gerridae and tadpoles are awesome."
"Such a big beautiful park, they welcome picnics and family BBQ right in the heart of the city"
Very good and big park in Montreal! I love it ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Beautiful walking paths. Lake with ducks. Clean washrooms, Covid friendly."
Beautiful park
It was a nice time! I love that park!
Excellent place to be with the family . Enough room to accommodate a large group.
Not a good time to visit this park. Trees are bare and pond has just a little water in it. Probably would look better during summer.
"Absolutely great experience! Definitely a perfect place to hang out with family or friends during a nice day. There is a lot of green space and a mix of sunny and shaded areas depending on what you feel like. Great spot for a picnic, outdoor games, and a little day drinking :)"
Pleasant park with nice benches.
Wonderful
Very nice park in the hustle and bustle of the city.
Love this park.
"A great place for you to relax in and just chill. We went there and lay on the grass by the water to look up at the blue sky, the maple trees, and enjoy the breezes. We even saw a white squarrel!

A good place to people watch (haha), as many people come here to run or bike. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was how loud the EDM music was from a distance in the park. Is it even legal to blast out music in public like that?!"
"Beautiful parc, huuuuge and wonderful, love the squirrels everywhere and good for a dog walk"
"Really really nice park. Lots of seating, open spaces, hidden from the city hustle, pretty lake, sports areas... Good job Montreal. Please keep working hard to keep up the excellent parks!"
Great park with lots of space and options.
"A fairly large park, with a very pleasant lake section that takes up nearly a third of it."
"The park to visit accord to many, many Montrealers, including myself. There's no better place to spend a sunny afternoon with friends, family, amimal companions or all of the above! Bring a nice picnic meal and perhaps an alcoholic beverage or six and you're in for one unforgettable experience!"
It was very good be out again with some friends respecting the social distancing
It's one of my favorite parks. Its large but isn't full of fields for sports.. People come for picnics and for bike riding or running. It's a very chill park.. Also there are hawks there if you like bird watching.
Beautiful park!
Nice place to loose time et take fresh air
"This park has everything. There's a lot of trees and you can sit by the water. There's a field for soccer, baseball, volleyball, and basketball. There's picnic tables and benches. People bring hammocks and barbeques for picnics. You can bring you dog here but I think it has to stay on its leash, and there's trails for biking."
For such a big park they could have more water fountains as well as bathrooms. But overall it's a beautifull place to spend the day
"Very nice place to spend the day with the family when the weather is nice. U can barbecue, picnic and play"
"Large park downtown. Great open sunny spots by the water, picnic benches in the shade for bbq."
Awesome friendly parc great for picknick
Beautiful public park... lots of squirrels!
"Running, chilling or playing some music, the kind of park i like."
"V nice park even in the winter. They have a little cafe that serves hot drinks also. I have to say the coffee was a little American diner, been sitting around since morning tasting but nonetheless on a cold day it will do."
The city had abandoned the park. Shameful.
"Spacious, beautiful, historic"
Nice environment.
Love this park. Always colorful and full of nice people. Summer is best for a walk in the park.
"Lovely place
Quiet and cozy to smoke in peace"
Great park to go hang with friends and family or even on a date.
Beautiful . Serene and autumn colors are beautiful
Best place for family picnic all around the year. My favorite time is the fall and winter.
Went ice skating on  sunny Saturday afternoon.  Lovely location on pond however  walk from change room to ice is treacherous.  Fell down on way out.  My companion fell on way off ice and broke her arm.  Staff  were indifferent.  On bright side  care at Notre Dame hospital was good
Here you can find lots of photos opportunities. This park is beautiful in any season. Summer time you can see shows and activities. You can bring your kids and have fun. It's a really popular park here in Montreal. The landscape is beautiful. A nice place to relax.
Great hidden gem in the heart of the plateau. Perfect for jogging running on hot days because of the good tree cover. A loop around the park is approximately 2.7km.
Good place to run or play group sports
Greatest Park in Montreal!
"If you're a local, tourist it doesn't matter since everyone comes here to enjoy a little bit of nature in the middle of the city. Having an amazing Portuguese chicken place and one of the best poutines in Montreal makes the area even better. It's a definite good place to come visit when in Montreal or even to just sit around during the weekend with friends, a loved one or your dog."
"A large, shady park, popular with young and old, dog walkers, runners, cyclists, tennis players and sunbathers--an urban oasis."
Gorgeous park but not sure why they still haven't filled up the pond
The ducks were engaging.ü¶Ü
beautiful park and peaceful
Beautiful place close to Sherbrooke metro station
Very nice place. Hard to find a spot to park.
"Amazing park with a lake! Seat, speak and relax!"
"A beautiful park in the middle of the Plateau. Large enough for your morning runs, it's a great place to picnic, practice yoga or read on your own."
"I've the opportunity to be on open air yoga class there was pure energy,  definitely one of my favourites parks."
"When of the best parks in summer and winter.
They have ice skating and a big playground during summer. BBQ area and tennis courts.
Walking around the park and jogging on the path, you discover hidden secrets..."
Nice park! Went there with My patnais twice already and got nothing bad to say about it!
"Nice park to see, enjoy the fresh air"
"Wide park, softball everyday, p√©tanque, volleyball, small off-leash dog park...
Nice spot for hammocks? In the pine trees by the water! Your hammock neighbors won't be too close but you can also create a small hammock gathering with your friends!"
Nice tons of room to keep a proper distancing
Huge park. There is places to play volleyball and basket. You can come with your bike
"Beautiful place! In the winter, the river freezes over and there are many families partaking in different winter sports!"
"Good for enjoing time with family, usually cowded"
The grass is sparse leaving lots of dirt and mud patches. Still a nice place to go for an afternoon. One thing the parks could use more of are public grills.
"I visit the Parc La Fontaine during a sunny say in the autumn and it was one of the most beautiful view I have ever had in my entire life. The yellow leaves on the ground and hanging on the trees, the sun making everything even more yellow, the ducks, the walking dogs and their owners... It was really good. I was needing a touch with nature and I had a blast that afternoon. Highly recommend."
Great to bring some drinks with friends. Have a picnic and run and cycle! It also has a train for young kids. Bring extra diapers for the kids.
Very scenic location during the summer and a nice ice rink during the winter.
I saw pictures of the park from fall and it they looked breathtaking. Maybe its the time of the year that makes the difference. I took the metro to the place and the experience was ok. Its end of August and there was a light drizzle. The water was calm but the weed cleaning going wasnt helping with the serenity. I wanted to use the bathroom and took a long walk to the back only to find it closed. Its a great place for some quiet time or to read a book. Needs more visits for a balanced review though.
"La Fontaine Park was absolutely lovely and so beautiful!

I spent an afternoon relaxing and walking around this gorgeous urban green space and had a great time. There were two manmade ponds, lots of walking paths and benches, and areas to picnic, suntan and relax. The park had plenty of mature trees and was a really pleasant place to spend time.

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful place to relax and enjoy nature within the city. It was a great place to walk and relax."
"Little heaven in the heart of Plateau MTL
I love this place"
"Beautiful park, but being the biggest park in one of the densest neighbourhoods in the country, it needs some TLC. Looking forward to the amphitheater opening back up, and maybe some repaving? Guys?"
I always like to spend time with my friends there not matter the weather or which day of the week !
"We stopped by just to skate, and were not disappointed! Deliciously thick and stable ice, ambient lighting, and just the right amount of people out.
Located nicely. Great spot to hang out!"
Lovely green-spot in the heart of the city.
"Great park to relax, have some food and drinks"
I love it
That is great place for families and individuals üòä
"Lovely park, squirrels come up to your."
One of the reasons why I love this city
"I really like this park as it has a lot to offer for everyone. Families and friends gather and they can just relax on the park, have a picnic and even play games. They also have a few courts to play, baseball, volleyball and more. I also find that in the warm summer weather, this location is quite cool that you can even sleep on the grass. One other perk is that it's close to popular restaurants if you're willing to line up."
Gorgeous üíó
Good place to go for a picnic or just a walk in the park.
Went there for a walk during the summer! I just love this park; so big and quiet!
The best place in town to do some slackline !
Beautiful big park. Lots of squirrels.
"What a wonderful surprise.  Stopped here to enjoy a park bench and a pop, and ended up staying for quite a while.  Beautiful fountain, boulevard of benches, and plenty of places for kids to play."
"The best park for walking, running, exercise, fun activities, barbecue. Best atmosphere in summer. And awesome view in fall."
"Serene, quiet park with a big pond. Had fun watching ducks, crows chasing squirrels."
"Clean, big spaces. Not enough sanitary blocks"
Awesome summer hangout. People watch or simply relax. Skip the lineup at la Banquise and head straight up to Avenue Mont Royal for ice cream or a drink post-picnic.
Nice place to cycle and walk by the artificial lake!
Awesome üëå
Really beautiful park near lots of amenities.
"For an urban park this does So much fun work: picnic spaces, huge walking zones, multiple pickup sports & official sports areas, playground, popular summer music events. The dormant central amphitheatre is too bad, all locked off from access, but overall a wonderful and well used city park"
"Nice parc, has a lake and outdoor playgrounds and nice atmosphere"
Best park in the city
‚ù§
Beautiful park with lots of green space to enjoy
Peaceful
"This is one of my favorite parks in Montreal. It is a great place to sit down and relax, have a picnic, walk around, bring the little ones to play. It has never dissappointed me."
One of the Top 3 greatest public parks in Montreal. A must-see: our very own Central Park!
"Huge beautiful park everyone just doing their thing. Enjoy your wine with a nice picnic, have a BBQ, bring your kids, have a date. Everything is possible at this park, there's enough room and spots for everyone!"
Love it!
"A very beautiful place, I like it"
Wonderful place to take a promenade
Good place to drink a beer and eat a dessert üòÇ
Some ducks are a bit pushy for bread crumbs. Nice area though
"This is one of the nicest parks in the city, any time of the day your find a good atmosphere. Rather it's to play tennis/ baseball or a simple stroll this is Montreal's central park."
Nice
"Beautiful area for walking, bike riding and picnicking.  There's a kids playground on one side of the park that has something for little ones 3+.  Very family friendly"
A very big park for jogging running.. wait a fountain lake in it.. beautiful
Ice skating here was very fun. You can rent skates and then head to one of the portables to change your shoes. Getting on the ice was hard as there are no guardrails at a place that's not a rink. But all in all it was a very unique skating experience.
A good place to visit with friends and family
"It is one of my favorite park in Montreal.
Really nice water and landscapes."
Lot's of trails and a nice big pond with a large fountain to admire while you kick back and relax. Although there are signs indicating no booze it is totally ignored. In the evening we saw groups of people enjoying wine and other beverages . It's a great atmosphere and wonderful for people watching. Bring a blanket or some camp chairs and enjoy the view.
It is always nice to cool off under the trees. The groundskeepers must work hard to keep the park tidy and groomed.
"I walk through this park sometimes on my way to work. Really peaceful, but be carefull of the bikes"
"It‚Äôs a vibe out here for sure. Great for a jog, going on a walk with your significant other or just soaking in the Montreal culture. Whenever I visit Montreal I try to get a place near here. Downtown isn‚Äôt too far, AirBnb prices are reasonable, and there are great food options in walking distance."
"Located in the Plateau area at a walking distance from Mont Royal and Sherbrooke stations, this park has two ponds separated by a bridge and small waterfalls. It also has a nice fountain in the middle of one of the ponds. This charming park is a fabulous place to go for a run, play frisbee, have a picnic, or a romantic date. Very pretty area to go and see, would definitely recommend taking some time out to see it and take in the beauty. Truly relaxing, very difficult to believe this kind of nature and serenity can exist in the middle of a busy city."
"Beautiful park, however, no restrooms nearby,THE CITY should put some extra, as well at Mont Royal."
Great to enjoy a laid back afternoon without being bothered. Lots of artists and students. I took a few naps there in warm days and it was very relaxing.
"Beautiful large park in the middle of the city. Spans several blocks. Walking paths, ponds, tennis courts, playgrounds. A great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city!"
Beautiful park but it needs to be fixed up a little. And put more security
Great place to take some creative pictures
It is a very lively park. You can see many you people from everywhere in the world.
"One of my favourite spots in Montreal. Easily accessible via public transit and there are lots of cool little things to check out. Bring some food, drinks, and a blanket and chill out for an hour - you won't regret it."
A great place to play soccer and meet some people from around the world!
Beautiful
Great place for families. The beach was excellent. Lifeguards were very alert.
Nice
It's nature in a big city
Very nice nature park in the middle of the city! Very good for running and any kind of activity ;)
"Nice big park with lots greenery, a lake, playgrounds, walking paths, benches, restaurant, short train rides (4$ pp), plenty of space for picnics but since it is on the Plateau, parking is scarce. 4 stars because last time we went there, the smell of weed just kept reoccurring over and over..."
Nice place to chill.
Whether you want to host a kid's birthday or you just want to spark one up and have some beer...this park manages to cater for everyone. It's really a microcosm of our society with picnic tables and a lot of greenery.
"Coming here is like stepping into an alternate dimension where people are at peace, every person of any color and gender are coexisting happily, and the nature is absolutely stunning. The squirrels will literally come hang out with you if you sit long enough. Super friendly people too!"
They have the most elaborate jungle gym for kids in the Plateau area and plenty of tables for adults to picnic at. Amazing place to spend a morning and afternoon. The fountain and pond is sure to keep your kids busy for a good while.
A nice park with a fountain and pond/pool sunken into the middle. The surrounding park and pathways are nice with lots of greenery in the summer.
Amazing beautiful parc in the middle of downtown
My favourite parc for leisure.
Nice park to stop for a break after hours of walking. You can grab some take away from the restaurants near by and enjoy on the grass
"Just skated here for the first time, can't wait to go back!"
Montreal's best urban park. Always lively! A great place to walk and talk or just people-watch. Nice little bistro in the heart of the park and cool occasional puppet shows and events.
"Beautiful park in the middle of the city that makes you forget you're in a city.  If you want to slow down and or get some fresh air, this is one of the places to go."
Great place for a run! It‚Äôs my usual spot for running almost every day.
Favorite park to sit with a friend on a summer evening and watch the sunset or have a good conversation. This park is a beauty in the city.
"Best place to park, eat and play."
AMAZING PARK FOR JOGGING RUNNING WALKING LUNCHING BICYCLE ROLLER SKATES AND SMALL LAC WITH DUCK IN IT AND MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OUT OF THIS WORLD EATERY AND REAL COFFEE PLACES FROM SCRATCH. THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IS KING IN FOREIGN FOOD. ..CHECK IT OUT

"17,000 Hours Played

""Good Park"""
Very lovely and lots of tables for picnics.
"Nice huge public park, clean, with tennis courts, a small artificial lake, baseball fields, volleyball nets, picnic tables, benches, parking (not free), etc. Unfortunately, there's no attraction in the close proximity of the park, but it's not far from downtown. Great place to go with kids."
"It's a very nice park. Took our wedding pictures there. Can be crowded at times, but usually it's because of an event."
very nice and fantastic park
Very nice spot to chill overlooking the pond and have a conversation.
What a fabulous place for a stroll in the middle of the city!  And perfectly situated along many walking routes to and fro.  More cities should have more park spaces like this.
IT WAS GOOD AND FUN
Great place to enjoy during summer
Very quite relaxing park also possible to hang out with friends and have a barbeque. Great amount of trees making nice shadows. Or a place where your dog can meet and play with other dogs.
For summer of course! Nice park in the middle of the city. Nice for a jog or a run or some fun in the sun.
Beautiful place to relax with friends or even on your own. Lots of green space to make your own and lots of lovely ducks.
Beautiful lakeside with lots of ducks and other bird life to see in August! There are many benches and tables to sit and jungle gyms for kids to play too.
Great for walking with the baby while visiting the city
Absolutely beautiful park that was definitely one of my favourite places I visited while in Montr√©al.
"Lovely and peaceful, usually go there to chill have some tea or choco-cafe, run or take a walk..."
"Great place for a stroll. The squirrels don't get scared of you, they will come up to you for food."
"Well Parc La Fontaine is always a great place to go in middle of down town... highly recommended it for pick-nick, take kids to play or just meditate and do yoga!!!"
"One of the calm, bland destinations in the city with a duck pond ,which make people spend their beautiful evenings even more incredible.
I had many memories laying on those passages.
A lot of space for fitness freaks and sport addicts,  especially in winter, city arranges  ice scating tracks on the frozen water basin, which is a must try choice when you are in montreal
Suer has much more to speak from chrping of the birds to snack thieve squirrels. Autumn shows the beauty and feel of you  eing in canada."
"A lovely park in the proximity of downtown, you can not get a better one around there for jogging, walking, relaxing and making a party"
If you're into parks like I am then you'll love this awesome spot!
Too many people out and about. For those of us with weakened immune systems re-opening the parks and not maintaining social distancing is not safe...
"A huge park with a fountain, bike trails, walking trails, tennis courts, soccer areas, base ball fields, tables, benches... Big mix of people doing many different things. Lots of green, shade, a kids area. The best park in Montreal. Can come for a BBQ and beer, weekly Jazz in the park, there's a Bistro, lots of room for your activities."
The park was so beautiful. The trees changing colors. The fountains and the monuments. The was even a NYCPD cop car there(pretty sure they were filming a movie) my fiance and I had a lovely stroll through the park during our visit to Montreal
Simply amazing! Call your family and friends to enjoy a dusk having a good conversation during a picnic
"What a great vibe! Between all the different activities from bowling to villeyball, music, walking and picnics to live concerts, it is an amazing place to spend a summer eevning with friends and family. Even the dog park offers a wading pool for a dog dunk!"
"Big and beautiful. Go at night, or any time of day. Lots of music playing, people sitting out on the lawns and benches. Very cool place. Love the trees"
"This park is pretty big, and it has so many nice chilling spots. Will definitely come back for a picnic aside of the pond."
"Great for picnic, BBQ and friend and family gatherings"
Very nice place! Perfect for chilling in the summer and ice skating in the winter.
Astonishing in summer
"I come here every year to skate. Its a nice place. Even if getting to the skating rink can be a little hazardous, depending where you park.

You can bring you skates or rent them on the spots as wepl as a few other items."
"Nice place to meet up with friends and have fun playing baseball, soccer, etc. Also, you could have a picnic there next to the lake. Bathroom available, great weather because of the trees."
"Love it, but really crowded. Overrated."
"One of the most beautiful parks in Montreal. You can arrive by walking from Mont royal station. Ideal to walk, jogging or enjoy a sweet spot alone or with your friends. Not a place to practice sports; but ideal to have a great bbq or a picnic dayüçû. Or just walk your üêï!"
"Very pleasant urban park. Dog park, children playground and ice rink (in winter)."
So much space!  Pond is wonderful to sit by and watch the wildlife.
"Great spot, really big parc that I is perfect for anything a small parc could be used but this one is really big."
"Nice nature escape from the city...in the city. Nice place to relax, have a picnic and gather with friends."

One of the greatest park in Montreal!
Great place for all ages. Really nice place to nap or walk
Beautiful park located near the Plateau area. Very clean and relaxing. Been!
Best urban park in Montreal!
Amazing place to hang out
Green space getaway. This spot is always reliable for a decompress with enough trees to provide shelter from the sun throughout the entire park. Can easily run around the entire perimeter under 5km.
Really clean and lovely with all the  ducks swimming around ‚òÄÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåª
I saw the fountain. It was meh. But the Parc was pretty fly. Although I saw a woman who let her toddler son take a leak on a tree. Pants all the way down in front of everyone. No shame. That kid is going places.
"Wonderful, even though we were just passing through. Our kids begged to stop and lay down in the shade on a hot day."
as always great park!
"It's really a great parc with a lot of space, playgrounds and other terrains for activities.
Considering it is such a good parc though, it is extremely popular so expect a lot of people. It ain't a good play for intimacy :P!
Still, you can find a cozy spot where you won't be bothered by anyone and you can somewhat wonder away in your sleep or in a deep conversation with a lover or with friends.
A beautiful pond is in the middle decorated with a few fountains here and there.
During summer, there's usually a couple of activities/small festivals going on, so it's always worth a shot."
Lovely peaceful place to enjoy
One of the best urban parks in the country. Worth a visit if you're in the area!
As always a good place to visit!
Hockey in ze winter (2 or 3 outdoor rinks whaaaaat?!?!). Foot in the summer (good level). Go out there and play. Have fun. Go go go.
very nice park. something for everyone.  kids park to bird wathing to different sport cycling. scenic.

"A beautiful park in a beautiful city. Perfect for a stroll or a picnic lunch. My wife, daughter and I had a relaxing lunch and enjoyed watching  the ducks at the pond."
Beautiful!
"A great place to come and enjoy yourself have a picnic  read a book,take your dog to the dog run, play frisbee.....meet  other people"
Great place to spend time with family and friends. Good place for walking. Great place for relaxing.
"Beautiful park, perfect for a stroll or just to sit and enjoy being outside. The squirrels are very cute and daring, most likely because they are being fed so often."
Beautiful parc!
"This is a very nice place to walk around in the plateau, have picnic and have a nice time outside. It have outdoor playground for kids and sports fields and a restaurant. It also have a lagoon (the reason for the name) that is beautiful when filled with water, which is not always . It could be better maintained though."
"Any season of the year...always serene...
For parking ... We use Avenue Calixa-Lavall√©e"
Not much to do in winter past 4pm
"Beautiful park with about a million squirrels.  Aussie, of you want to see squirrels (and I know you do), come here!"
"I love this park, particularly in winter. The lake freezes and you can skate on it but it's not the best ice surface. I'm sure it's lovely in all seasons but it's a great place to relax"
It is one of the best park in Montreal
Beautiful park
It's a pretty nice park but there isn't really much to do there because there aren't any playgrounds and the grass isn't really clean.
It ok need some love to make it great again
Beautiful green oasis in the city's heart. Every season has sth to offer.
Quiet and inviting.  It was a hot day the water was welcoming at the pool.
Huge and quiet park but not very well maintained but still love it!
Lots of birds
Lafontaine Parc in the summer is awesome to hang out at...winter is also beautiful!!! Go feed some chips to the squirrels.
Hey this was great! You can drink in public with friends as long as its a picnic*
Excellent offleash dog park. Good place to laze around with a bottle of wine on a Sunday afternoon.
If you would like a place to relax just go there!
"Lovely park, a lot of space. Very good location"
"Where: La Fontaine Park - Montreal

One of the best parks in Montreal to spend weekend. Usually a lot of people are playing or doing exercises or relaxing. Several Bixi stations around the park which let you easily get a bike. Parking is available too.
"Blessed be the day that this park was created! It's such a great place to walk your dog, go for a picnic or a walk."
"Beautiful park...pond...walking paths. Close to food, snacks, and restaurants.  Tall trees.."
Really nice park to walk around or sit down near the pond
"Awesome in winter for skating with frozen lake, lights and music. My favourite park in the city."
Excellent for dogs because of a large enclosed dog run. This park has a population of albino squirrels that are fun to feed. Attractive shirtless bodies abound by the synthetic lake. Fun to watch circus performers and acrobats practice routines by stringing tightropes between trees.
We went skating on the lake in this park. Had a great time. The ice was very nice and there was plenty of room to skate. They have equipment for Learners. They have indoor change rooms and snack bar and restaurant.
I love this park. A nice place to have a barbacue and some beers ofcourse
"For a city park, this place is awesome. A lot going on here on a summer day. Nice pond with koi fish and ducks, which is transformed into a skating rink in the winter. The lands are spacious, with lots of room for picnics, playgrounds and pools for children, a good bike path, and free parking when you can get a spot in the central lot. Beautiful trees, champagne squirrels, and even a train."
"Unfortunately we went there only before spring, so the park is still a bit barren. But I can imagine it must be a beautiful place when it's green in summer time."
"Went there for skating, it's free(if you have your own skates and locks), has lots of lights, there is and indoor facility to change your skates and bathrooms. The park itself is pretty big and beautiful for a little walk. Bear in mind it's fresh water skating, so the ice is not the smoothest. But still fun and beautiful."
Such a fun park with all sorts of activities happening all the time.
Nice park to go to... Especially during the summer lol
"My favourite park in Montreal. Great for all kinds of activities. Big playground for children of all ages, dog park, many kinds of sports areas. Theatre and shows, wading pools for kids in the summer and free skating in the winter. Also great area to snow sled with kids."
An excellent place to get relaxing and enjoy the nature and a quiet atmosphere
"Ideally placed on the plateau, accessible all day long from every corner with subway and buses, with dog park, volley-ball p√©tanque baseball football (the real one) and American rugby, and green grass, benches, trees, and a lac ... id√©al for everyone including family pic-nic !!"
I love it
Nice park to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature without leaving the city. There‚Äôs a nice lake with plenty of benches to enjoy as well as no shortage of walking and biking trails.
Nice park in the middle of the city. Lots of little critters running around.
Big open parc with small lake in middle. Great for bringing friends over
Great park to walk and gather your thoughts beautiful surrounding and with the pond makes it that much better!

Beautiful and peaceful afternoon. Best park in the city
Just beautiful. More than just a walk in the park.
A quiet park in a residential area.
Nice place to unwind
Amazing place to hang around or play frisbee with your friends. Its very common to see random  people play musical instruments around the park. The atmosphere is very pleasant and enjoyable.
This park has everything. Lots of activities and a great mix of people.
Crowded but quite a nice park
"Great park! Very big. Lots of paths. Often quite full of people lounging, picnicing and playing games in the summer. Skating in the winter. Lots of trees but open fields too. Volleyball courts. A bocce ball area. Baseball diamonds and a soccer field. Might be tennis courts too. The large pond is really nice in the summer. Theres a small amplitheater. Always something going on in this park. Great for a picnic or for a few evening beers with friends. I think the law is you can have beer or wine if you also have food. It's kind of like a mini central park in Montreal."
Beautiful place for evening walk
"My favorite parc in Montreal. If you like to ice skating,  you need to go there during winter. They have a huge lake to do it."
Chill and relaxing vibes this afternoon with a nice sunset over the Fontaine not totally filled yet. Summer it's almost there...
It's a Great Park in to go walking running hiking and doing outdoor exercises in the morning as well as evening and it has a beautiful water pond
It's so beautiful.
We had an amazing time.
"It is a great place if you just want to hang out with friends and spend the day relaxing. Bring your food and a blanket and just spend the time socializing with family and friends. Visually the park is okay. There is a lot of open grassy areas to sit down on but not much else. There's a man made lake in the middle but even that looks a bit gross. It is a green colour and I don't find that very appealing. There isn't that many trees but other than that, it's a good place to just spend the day outdoors."
"This park has a unique facet for each season, the four of them equally beautiful."
Beautiful little man made lake with ducks
"This parc has a lot of energy, people go there for barbecues, to play some sports (baseball, volleyball, soccer) and also enjoy the nature in the middle of the city. I consider this parc a little version of NY's Central Park :-)"
"This park is amazing during the whole year. Beautiful to relax and walk around through summer, beautiful colours during autum and fun for a slide or ice skating during winter."
Best parc in Montreal
"Great park with kids playground, volleyball, a lake and more."
"Iconic Montr√©al park. What a pleasure to hang out there with friends with food and drinks. Whether it's during the day or at night, Parc Lafontaine offers a great vibe and yet is super spacious so you're not stepping on anyone's toes."
"Vibrant and active park full of all sorts of activities for all walks of life. You'll find plenty of young folks practicing their favorite hobbies, but there are also playground for the kids and a pond to relax around. The pond is picturesque attracting new weds and their photographers."
"Beautiful,  peaceful and popular park to walk your dog, read,  or admire ducks and ducklings enjoying a dip in the water"
"Great place to walk and exercice, winter or summer."
Excellent park for friends and family located in the heart of montreal. Good place place to hang around.
"Not a family place anymore! In the middle of the afternoon too many teens and young adults smoking cannabis as well as drinking at the same time. A few years ago I enjoyed taking my daughter to the park, no we avoid it like the plague."
"Lots of seagulls and insects above our heads, but, really cool people to talk to"
"Very big, well maintained, variety of activities.  Totally a very nice park"
It's huge amazing place to talk a long walk
Popular Mtl Stoners corner. Extremely chill and excellent ice scating during winter.
Enjoyed running here. Big spacious and clean.

Amazing autumn!!
I like this park but it is not clean enough.. there are a lot of garbage in the lake.. and also on the grass.. some bicyclists don‚Äôt drive carefully and you have to take care your kids.. otherwise there are a lot of good activities organized  in the summer time..
Good times. Bring a BBQ! Come for a picnic! Play volleyball! Soccer! Baseball! Tennis! Have a few beers! Watch random people play music!
Nice parc in the centre of Montreal. A must see!
"Beautiful view, location is great"
"Very nice place, but A lot of people all the time. In winter you can skate on lake. Lots of activities. Nice for walks. Harder to find parking on the weekend."
"Love this park. It's big and it has a little bit of everything. A nice lake that it's beautiful in every season and paths all over. You can even do ice skating in winter. I've been here for workouts, walks and picnics and I've always had fun. The only caveat is that for running it tends to be super icy in the winter (more so than other places that I've been)."
"It's a nice park. Good enough space for parking.

However, there were large crowds and I couldn't take the smoke. I don't even want to talk about temporary toilets that were installed near parking."
"The shortest distance between two Frisbees is rare air, which science has long struggled to explain. And yet it exists. Very green come summer, very white in winter, one can only wonder how many dreams have been hatched, how many romances those arching branches have witnessed. Cigarette butts play their role too, reminding the sun searching souls that nothing is prefect."
It is a nice park with ponds.
Perfect spot to chillout a bit :)
A great place to relax and have a nice walk in more natural surroundings.
"One of the best, feel good parks in Montreal."
"Great place, so many things to do  !  Dogs are welcome and they have a dog park. There's also a very nice artificial lake and you can skate on it in the winter."
Best place to walk and for ice skating during winter

Lovely place. All kinds of activities. Just amazing.
"So much fun to hang out there in the summer. It can get a bit crowded but since it‚Äôs a huge park, you can always find a place to sit and enjoy."
Beautiful park in the middle of Le Plateau. It has a central park vibe to it. It offers lots of activities ranging from sightseeing to organized sports. It's definitely a park to see in Montreal.

"Beautiful park, I like to come here for a relaxing walk and read a book with a majestic sight and fresh air."
"Nice place... Quiet, relaxing, even someone brings beer."
I love this park!

"Awesome volleyball courts in the summer, great hockey rink  in the winter!"
Large park with lots of room to run around or relax with books/friends. Really pretty to walk through in the winter as well.
Popup up outdoors
During winter you can skate on the canal. You can rent skates and there are warming huts to warm you up and change
My fave mtl parc!
Beautiful and cozy!
"One of Montreal's gems, Parc La Fontaine embodies the charm of the plateau, with musicians, people exercising, families, dog owners, and people from all walks of life mingling.  It's  a substantial park, for an urban green zone, with a big pond, and nice manicuring.

A truly excellent place to relax on a nice day.

The one point of contention is the amphitheater, which seems like a promising venue, but which is very run-down.  I've never seen or heard of any performances being staged in this venue, which strikes me as unfortunate, given its potential."
Nice peaceful park where you can enjoy a glass of wine or whatever
"Big playground for kids, pond, kiddie pool, baseball and tennis. Beware, parking is not free! Paid $4.50CAD for 90 minutes at the booth. People sunbathing around the pond. Lots of bikers and runners. Relaxing atmosphere. It is clean and well kept. Lots of picnic tables. Great for a family walk. Saw an amphitheater. Probably they have some festivals."
Garden of Eden... eat your heart out!! Plus this place is snake free! ;)
Beautuful park. A piece of green right inside the city.
This park is large and a good relaxing point to hang out that's close to old Montreal and Mont Royal.
Very cool place for walking and relax in a sunny sunday...
It is nice. So many people even at night
Very nice place to visit in a good summer evening...
This would have been a nice park except that it is not maintained properly. The grass is overgrown and there are a few homeless people loitering in the park. There is a side of the park next to the water where young people still hang out. The city could improve this further.
"Big, yet cozy park!"
Beautiful park with a small lake in the middle. Well maintained like most parks in Montreal!

Place to relax during summer. Walk around the lake or just lie down and relax in the sun.
"This beautiful park in the heart of Montr√©al is great for sitting on the grass, and let time go by in the summer. In the winter, a portion of the lake is used for ice skating (for free!) and if you don't have skates of your own, you can rent some at the chalet next to the rink."
Most beautiful park in Montreal. Bring a throw and you ll have a great time for sure (eat drink walk relax sleep tan anything)

"Great park for the kids and adults, you can eat.  Some people were having a kids party and drinking and no one came to bother them."
"Amazing park:  tennis court, dog park, artificial lake, soccer field, baseball field. Got everything in the center of Le Plateau!!"
"Always a relaxing time while in the park. Also, you get to see interesting things while people watching. Musicians, yogis, cute doggies, families, sporties, funny & weird drunks. In the summertime, there's free wifi. Public toilets are convenient too. A tchoo-tchoo train circles around the park, $4 a ride per person. You can't be let down while at Laf Park."
Nice park to share activities with friends and family
One of my favorite parks has a theatre in the middle of it all and building where they do all sorts of activities!
It's really a nice parc ‚ô•Ô∏è

Lovely parc . Perfect to skate in the winter or have picnic by the pond
Big parc with many things to do. The lac is transformed in a big ice skating are in the winter. Really great place
Very clean park. They should add a compost bin beside the garbage and recycle bin at the Avenue parc-fontaine and Cherries corner.

Nice Park with several paths available all year long for wandering quietly
Spacious and lovely playground for different age groups. Absolutely our fav in downtown!
"If you stop at Saint-Liboire for you gas, you ought to keep going a bit further for an amazing poutine at Dave & Dan. The cheese is super fresh and it feels like there is more of it than there are fries. Amazing!"
We love everything about this  B&B. We highly recommend.
"Very nice and huge parc, plenty of place to relax on the grass and watch the fountain. Also great for walks with your loved one or friends.

Lovely place. Just wish the the fountain lived up to the parks name. Instead of being what looks like a bunch of sad hoses spraying aimlessly into the sky.
"Nice place. Free parking slot.
Small lake with natural ducks and birds.

Very beautiful in fall!"
Random city park. Not particularly well laid out. Too many paths edging out the greenspaces. Lacking something but I can't figure out what...

Very pretty park. Lots of characters too.

"Large park with a long pond which shores presents great green areas for picnics and walks along its long contour. A nice well shaded forest is a blessing in the Summer. Music, picnics, families having a rekax time...  right in the neighborhood of the Montreal city's Mount Royal Plateau"
Great place to stroll and relax in the heart of montreal
"Ideally on of the best parks in the city after Mont Royal.
What makes this park special is that it is right next to a lot of restaurants,  there is always something happening, and it is great for both running and biking.
If you are visiting definitely check it out, and don't forget to eat Poutine at la banquise after, it is right next to it."
Really beautiful oasis in the city.
"One of the best known and loved park in Montreal. During the winter the frozen lake turns into an ice-skating free platform, music provided!"

Warm friendly and welcoming.
Great place to visit and relax.
Good place to relax for four seasons.  Normally there are not too many people. It is the destination of marathon montreal.
All year long great place be it winter or summer time to relax. Very well taken care of.
"One of the best parks in the city. A bit more shaded than the main Mont Royal park, great for sports chill outs and bbq"
Beautiful city park in Montreal with lots going on everyday. Hosts many different festivals and has an outdoor cinema.
Nice park for summer and winter... The main pond becomes an ice rink. In summer there is a train for kids that does around the park.
Awesome place! We had a lot of fun!
Nice place for skating during winter
"Hands down my favorite park in Montreal. Well maintained and located (near a bunch of nice groceries and SAQs for picnics), gorgeous pond and trees, and great jogging and biking paths that circulate around the parc. Usually there are a few local musicians jaming respectfully. Perfect for families, outings with friends, and for a nice summer date."
Lovely place. Went to take some night shots during a snow fall. Felt pretty much safe(up until ~10PM)
"Great park lots of activities to do. Baseball, tennis, volleyball and more"
Beautiful quiet park at the heart of Montreal. Also very nice location for spending time with family and kids. Very family friendly location.

"Nice atmosphere, quite enjoyable to sit around the pond and listen to some local artists play music."
"Fantastic park for going for a walk or a picnic in the summer. In the winter there is a large outdoor ice rink and two small hockey rinks (you can rent skates or bring your own for a fee). In the summer there are also various performances (such as dance shows, theatre, movies) several times a week, free of charge. There are tennis courts, p√©tanque play areas, beach volleyball, a soccer field, a baseball field, and even an enclosed dog park. There‚Äôs also a large field to play whichever sport you want (in front of the dog park, probably need to book it unless no one is using it) and plenty of space to play outdoor games or make bbq, though it can get crowded despite how large the park is. And of course there‚Äôs a large pond with a fountain and ducks. You don‚Äôt even need to come with food ‚Äî there‚Äôs Ma Poule Mouill√©e and La Banquise right next to it and a d√©panneur to buy drinks. Pretty much everything you would ever want from a park."
Big park in Montreal
Such a lovely place to hang out alone or with friends. It's an oasis of nature in the middle of the nice but busy plateau mont royal.
Lovely setting in an urban environment
"Very cute Park(for the urban east) , nice to come chill with friends. If you're used to BC it's nothing special but for Montreal it's Dope."
"Daydreaming about going back to the park to walk my pup.  The most peaceful, relaxed park in Montreal.  Hurry up summer!"
"A good park to go with some friends. On the weekend, there are a lot of people gather there, and it has a great sense of community. I don't advise taking a swim in the artificial lake since it's notoriously very dirty, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal! Other than that, feel free to eat your lunch there, or go biking. For a more impressive parc, visit the Mont Royal, or even the Parc Maisonneuve."
A great urban park with a good playground on the north side for kids. One of the best and most fun parks in the city.
Beautiful park. Went there to toboggan in the snow and ended up by the ice skating area. Beautiful regardless if the season
"This is possibly one of the most unsafest/dirtiest parks in Mtl as far as I'm concerned. It wasn't always like this many decades ago, but alas, now it's simply not the same anymore which is sad because the park itself has immense potential. You'll often encounter dog 'residue' or loitering all over the place) on your path if you care to take a stroll. Unfortunately, this park is not only gross, but dangerous. Despite the police station (pdq) 38 being across the street, it doesn't stop questionable crowds from discouraging people from going to squat for a picnic or a night walk. Don't let your children play or go there alone."
"Very beautiful park, spent the picnic with my friend berry"
Lots of activities to do. Very peaceful. Nice to do picnic
"It's clean and beautiful small pond in the middle. You can also do BBQ here, and washing room near by as well"

One of the many beautiful parks of Montreal. Ideal for picnic. Also the pond in the middle makes it even prettier.

"Spacious park with a variety of scenes. Good for reflection, music, painting and sports. Best spot in the plateau for me."

very nice place to hang out and just chill.

8 mins walk from Sherbrooke metro.
I recommend anyone to come here for a nice little picnic."
"This is for the kiddie pool...the parc itself is beautiful! I took my kids there last Thursday we were all in bathing suits (i am Muslim) and we were approached by a young girl before we even got to the pool....she started to tell me there is a new policy that you can't go inside if you don't have a swimsuit....i looked at her and said ""I'm wearing a swimsuit"" so I get Inside and noticed I was the only parent with a bathing suit!
I didn't say anything even though I was mad....so I'm playing with my kids and was approached again by a male lifeguard at that point I got mad...started saying look around...I'm the only person with a bathing suit! My burkini is clearly a bathing suit made of Lycra....it's unbelievable how racist people can be..I live in the Plateau....stupidity has no limit...will not go back."

A great parc in the heart of the plateau. So nice to skate on the huge pond. Great for kids.

"An isle of peace and quiet in eastern mtl, I saw 2 deers!"
Amazing I loved this place is very close to Montreal
Very peaceful place accessible by car or bicycle on the island of Montreal. The place is magnificent and very well maintained. Walking trails are cut out and we can find small quiet places or rest on the water's edge.
"Big and beautiful parc on the island. Awesome place for hiking. Came across some gazelles there. Beautiful place for BBQing, I recommend the far east side of the park, near saint lawrence river for bbqing, there are plenty of tables and benches. However, if you choose to go to the far east side, note that the closes washrooms will be 2km away from you, at the heritage chalet."
"Great place for a walk. It reminds visitors what wetlands are without having to leave Montreal. While not in the city center, getting there in a car takes little effort. Parking a car in the neighborhood around the park is easy and costs nothing. Take a quick visit to the park center/chalet for information on what would be of most interest to you. I recommend packing a mosquito repellent because wetlands are natural breeding grounds for a range of insects."
"Beautiful place, but the parking is only with credit card, no cash"
We had a nice walk there! Shot below is by the water
A lot of areas to walk around. Lots of cyclists too at this corner of Montreal.

Love this place. It is always busy. Winter than summer lol.

"Nice big park with a workout area, basketball court, half soccer field, water pad two separate play areas and a full track ! Amazing park..."
"Fun place to be, there's a cool varieties of fun stuffs for kids of all ages. Only one negative point : the bathroom doors were closed."
Great place to go sliding with your kids but it can gets very crowded...
"Nice place to go for a run, play with kids or train. There's also a soccer place and a basket ball court. There's also a climbing wall."
Nice park everything it's new:-)

"Nice little park . Well maintained.  Seems like a family area, kids came and left all afternoon"
"Parc id√©al pour les jeunes familles, jeux pour enfants, aires de pique-nique, etc."
Great for kids.
This park needs work. It does the job but does not have much appeal to it and the structures are falling apart.
Just walked by
Great little neighbourhood park
Perfect for the kids
"Small and clean,perfect for families with kids."
Nature and nature again
"A small park but good to stay with kids. The playground is well maintained and there are some benches where you can sit and relax while watching the people sliding, and rolling, thru the snow with their boards. In the winter, dress you warm because some cold winds reach the place."
"Clean park where you can relax, playground for young kids and toddler!"
Great place to relax
Nice and clean
Nice shade for sitting and clean.
"Parks are a treat to your overall well being. Walk, sit on bench, relax and get some fresh air.

You can always find people roaming around in this park. It‚Äôs safe to be here. You can always grab some food from nearby restaurants."
Flowers boutique on Square Victoria is so colorful and beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è all year long
"Such a beautiful park to sit and relax, people watch anytime of day."
Cute but could have more games for all childrens... Needs a little investment
"I mean, it's not done."
Almost cool
It's a very nice park with a few slides and swings for children as well as a cool water pool and a small waterfall which is active for a few hours during the day. There are also some benches to spend a few minutes with your friends and eat together.
"I love this Park. Located in the middle of the neighbourhood, this parc is great for everyone from kids to families including eldery people. You can play soccer or have a small fun with the new water games. There's a community center in the middle of the park offering a lot of activities. The park is also accessible on many ways, from Pare street to De la Savane.  It has also a community garden."
"Beautiful, quiet, big space in the back, basketball court, small ice rink (winter), small community garden. Facing north is De La Savane, south is Pare street."
"Always great to have a little bit of green in the city, small playground for kids"
"Nice features like 2 parks, 1 baseball field, garden, waterpark, soccer field and basketball court."
Nice basketball court. Clean too.
Quiet small parc with children playground and some benches.
Nice park with amor of activities for kids
It's a park. I mean. What does one say? It's close to metros. Around the corner from a Tim Hortons and McDonalds. No bathrooms though.
Nice small dog Parc. Friendly neighborhood
Lunches in the park can really brighten up the day
Personality
Nice playground and relaxing moment
"No public washroom, but otherwise plenty of fun for the kids."
Average park
STILL the same after 40 years
My first time
"Suddenly you find out something, though you've been there many times before!"
A Staircase with a slide what more could you ask for.
ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
"It's a nice park to get to walk through every day. The Prefontaine metro is right at one corner. There is a skate park, playground for kids, ice arena, baseball field and lots of grass and quiet spots.

There is also a lot of squirrels here, I suspect they are plotting world domination but I can't prove it yet."
Spacious park; plenty of room for various activities.
Drinking in peace.
It's a very good park there is a lot of construction in it. June-2020
"I love this park because it's not far from my home and it's a nice little walk in the mornings for the dog and myself. Nice place for picnic, or to bring the kids to play in the playground during the week on a Wednesday night you can catch a baseball game."
Hate this parc. For real
"Renovated arena, parking, walking distance to m√©tro Prefontaine"
"This park would be better if there weren't so many pedestrians and sketchy looking people constantly crossing through. The children's section is NOT enclosed, which means you've got to keep a very close watch on your kids. The park is adjacent to the Prefontaine metro so expect a constant stream of hasty (read: dreary) workers marching to and fro the metro station. It makes for quite the scene but not a good place for kids to play on their own. We'd much rather take our kids up the hill, past Sherbrooke, to the angus park behind the Canadian tire. Amazing place for the whole family!"
This park needs a lot of work. It leads to Station Prefontaine. Walkways are in bad shape. Many stickers/posters on poles.
Looking for a great place to live? This can be one of them. Next to ontario street a new hip place. Not to far from Masson street another  place that is getting big and close to the metro where downtown montreal is only 10mn by metro away.
"This park is not that big but it has a little bit of everything: baseball field, Arena, skate park, petanque court jjungle gym and a little pool for kids (which has not been functional the past couple of years). Also, during the summer there is a bixi station and a piano set up by the city."
Good for skateboarding. There is also a shallow outdoor pool for small infants.
A decent parc not far from its proper Metro
lovely place to get sun in summer and play soccer
"Nice place, but much better in the summer!"
Super chill park to hangout near the metro
Now it looks cool.
Nice new hockey rink.
great place to unwind in an urban location
Right next to Prefontaine metro nice park to take a break from the stress of life.
Fun times!
I love this park.
"Big parc with a baseball field, swings and picnic areas."

"Very good park. They've recently redone the children's play area and the benches near that. On a sunny weekend, definitely expect the park to be crowded, be it summer or winter - doesn't matter. Before COVID, once or twice we've also been musical concerts during summer. So, quite a happening place.
Great park for kids."
"Overcrowded place, lacking maintenance. Unsafe shoreline crashing into water. Great ‚Äúocean view.‚Äù"
"This park is simple but pretty by the river.
It has water entrance, so you can bring your kayak or to do water sports that not with motor.

In the winter is perfect place to do sladge with kids."
"Lovely park with beautiful views of Champlain bridge and the south shore. The park benches were a little worn out, but no big deal. Access to water is limited, but it's much nicer than the shore in Verdun. Full of old people walking their purebred dogs."
Nice park for a small slege! Good for families and with a beautiful view!
Good bike path
It's a great place to visit. The place is clean and calm. In the evening it's even more beautiful.
Beautiful spot for dawn and full moon sights.
Nice park with a fancy tiny beach where you can spend time in peace.
One of the most beautiful parks I have seen in my life.
"Clean, spacious and green"
easy go easy play
Nice Green space but if I knew it's such a small area I'd never move to visit there. There are other nice places in Nan's island you can walk for longtime and enjoy your walk!
We love West Vancouver for it's amazing parks... Check pit McKeachnie Park for some shade one day
"During summer, there are many events, like concerts and theater plays done at this park. You might want to bring your own chair if you don't want to sit on the grass, as chairs brought by the municipality are usually not enough.
There is also a nice playground for kids 3-5 years old."
Quiet and lovely park
I love this park. It's simple but has a wonderful view of Lawrence river. I recommend

"Well kept, beautiful scenery."
Nice view on the river. Can be very relaxing at the right moments.
relatively small but beautiful sceneries overlooking to saint Laurent river ideal for jugging and biking around the island
"Good place to hangout with friends and play frisbee with kids, lots of place and has music festivals during summer."
Such a beautiful place to chil out with family and friends.  There's even a swimming pool that seems to be public.
Love it! Beautiful in the spring with all the flowers from the clubapple trees
Like it
It is small park with a playground for kids. It is beside the river. There are some benches for picnicking.
Montreal is a terrific city and Isle des Soeurs is a delightful residential enclave.

Nice walkways and next to quite a few resturants and a church if thats your thing."
"it was nice. some water access, places to sit. quiet."
Nice open space for kids with waterpark.  Grass is yellow but the slides make up for it.
Very nice view for a walk or cycling.
"in 1608, Samuel de Champlain continued to explore the continent with the objective of establishing a settlement - a New France - in North America. It is what they call the Route of Champlain (i.e. following the trail of Champlain)

In 1615, he climbed the Ottawa River, the Mattawa River and the French River until he reached Georgian Bay on Lake Huron on August 1, 1615. After a stay in Huron land, a military mission the conduit to the south.¬†He leaves Huronia and descends the Trent River to the United States today.¬†An injury forced him to spend the winter of 1615-16 in the Wendat between Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe, a very populous area, which remains equally magnificent."
Very family friendly park. Lots of space and activities to do for the kids.
"Beautiful, Peaceful.
Great place to go and just think"
Tresbeau
Nice park!
"A very nice park which was a great location for celebrating john Baptiste day with La Bottine Souriante. There was a nice little stage with a tight knit atmosphere. There was also a playground, plenty of green space, and a nice view of the water. I would definitely come back here if I get the chance."
Nice
"Very nice park where you can make a walk along the awesome view of the river , clean place, garbage and recycling bins all around and along the sidewalk of the river, special roadway for bicyclists, toilettes,  playing area, swings, water fountains to drink, and splashing water fountains for kids and families to enjoy the hot summer ."
good park for kids and activities during the summer Kayak and shows are happening there they have made a few changes over the years and it's for the better

House on the river

Quaint little neighborhood park along the river. A great stop for those using the bike path as well
Great parc. Has a water play area  jeux d'eau.  Play gear for older and younger kids
"I like the little park, but really like to walk on walking path from Pie-IX bridge to Aim√©-L√©onard park. Very small. Not a lot of parking around."
"Pretty parc but certainly needs a parc attendant ton enforce regulations ( littering, dogs not on leash that run up to kids) and prevent vandalism. But amenities are fairly new and interesting the water games are appreciated by my kids."
Nice for kids water park is good when it's hot could be crowded sometimes
I like this place
Love to walk in that park. the view was beautiful
"Great watergames instalations for kids, great view and training gear. Also a multitudes of events all season!"
Almost all parks in Montreal are nice and this one does not disappoint either!

Cute parc : )
Nice place
It's ok
It has a fence for the kids games
Nice place to realax
Beau parc de quartier !
"True green spaces in the city are to be protected and looked after. This is one such green space. Great spot to unwind and relax or walk your dog. Enjoy the trees and oh, the squirrels. Lots of squirrels."
Its beautiful here in the fall.
"A very nice place to happen upon while out for a walk in the area. Parc Saint-Gabriel has a pleasant feel. Walking through it does not seem as if some artificially human made destination, created just to add some green space in an otherwise residential and some commercial area. There are pieces of art type-esque additions that were added but are not intrusive, rather, they're complementary. The trees are the calming charm - old enough to be developed. There is a path that diagonally goes through the park which is convenient if headed to the nearby commercial destinations however the green space would be an enjoyable place to have a picnic, sit and read or throw around a frisbee. It's not especially large but does not feel cramped. Street parking."
"A beautiful little Park in the heart of Point Saint Charles,,, right next to Saint Gabriels elementary school. A great place to read a book,,, feed the squirrels,,, and watch the birds as you enjoy the afternoon away! Remember to pay it forward everybody peace out and have a great day!!!"
You could relax
Relaxing
"Nice little park with a good number of benches, great for a light morning coffee & pastry. I love the trees; they are huge. it's nice to have little patches of green space and the diagonal path cutting through is handy."
"Feels safe at night. Looks good, its small, overall a nice place to sit for a couple minutes to eat your lunch or something."
"Love the new jungle gym that they gave the kids. Always see kids playing around here, not much crime in this area anymore thanks to this park. Kids always have something to do and stay out of trouble :)"
"Its a quaint little park with outdoor rinks for ice skating and hockey. There's a playground for kids, green space, benches, baseball, and a splash pad in the warmer months."
A great park for sitting and playing with your pet.
Peaceful and well lighted in the night. Many seats.
Nice calm park for a picnic
Great park my spot
Lovey park loads of history foliage flowers
Just a Park with benchs to chill
Some really old trees are in this park.
Lot of ‚ùÑ
"Petite oasis de verdure agr√©able, beaucoup de bancs, mais les chemins asphalt√©s sont en mauvais √©tat."
Great place for kids to play
Very nice park. I love the soft ground.
"Nice park with lots to climb on. There's also a library, pool, and community centre."
"Park Pr√®vost, on De La Roche Street, is a beautiful park that is good for both adults as well as children.
On our two day trip to Montreal from Toronto, my wife, son, and I lived at a friend's house on this street.
The park has a children playground with plenty of equipment to keep your children entertained & busy, a baseball field, and an ice rink in winter.
The park provides pollution free area to the people of the neighbourhood who like to walk, jog, run, or cycle on well maintained paved walkways in natural environment."
"It's a park. Kids modules, ice rink in the winter and baseball field, could do better with a little extra care."
No dogs allowed
Cute naiborhood park
very small
Great park with water playground for kids. There's also a playground for dogs too. But no toilet though.
Small and cute in a nice neighborhood. Definitely will return with the kid to enjoy their water games.
"Love this park. There is a splash pad during the summer, baseball court, and playground for kids ( toddlers and older ones). But if dog owners could stick to the dog park on site ( or at least freaking pick up their dogs poop üôÑüôÑüôÑ!!) it would be even better."
"Good dog park, nice people."
lil fun
Nice place
"The parc Li√©bert isn t the best park in the area but still it has potential as there is 2 child s playground. One of them is equipped with water so kids can splash aroundüòÇ there are 2 baseball playgrounds and some paths in between when you could go for a run. I personally not a fan of this park as the sun don t seem to go through and it s pretty much dark all day. But if you want to hide from the heat and the sun, this will be your perfect spotüòÇ"
One of the few dog park in the area
"I've discover this park this morning after reading the positive comments about the park. I brought my nephew and niece who are 3 and 4 years old and it s the first time that they actually don t want to stay in a park. It s quiet small, the games are limited and not as clean as the other park. But the swimming pool near the park is really nice and i defenely recommand it."
Small parc in a quiet neighborhood. Outdoor pool accessible in the summer.
Great public pool
"fun, but exposed"
Il faut refaire les modules
"Such a lovely and clean park. Big area, big sports ground, ideal for family outing."
Really enjoyed our picnic. Good park if u have a dog there's a special space 4 them
"It was pretty fun, the swings weren't up though. It sort of ruined the experience a bit because i was looking forward to that, but other than that it was fun!"
Lots of space to walk around and very clean üëçüèª
Lovely park with several sports areas (soccer etc).  Park is very big  but flat.  I like hills and anticipating what's behind the trees and hills.
Great play area for kids!
"Public restrooms were locked, don't go there for a wee. The couche-tard a bit further on Beaubien is where it's at.

Park itself seems nice though."
"Nice park, relatively clean, they have a dog court but seems to not be a point for dog owners they are everywhere ... üôÑ"
This is a really nice neighborhood park. it is large and has a lot of place to sit or to play a game. They have a baseball field that host a couple of friendly matches. It is a great place to bring your kids since here is some playground for them. It is also a nice place to go for a picnic with friends. It is not one of the most popular park in Montreal so it isn't overcrowded. I would definitely recommend to go there if you're in the area.
A cosy little park for kids
"Very nice park, good for all age people. The park is very clean and has some good playing equipments for kids, but why there is no stop sign when we want to cross the beaubien street from the park? The stop sign will efficiently help drivers reduce the speed, especially there are so many kids playing there in the summer, when they are running around, it could be dangerous for them."
"Beautifully renovated park, dog park one of the best I've seen. Nice little outdoor gym too."
Great park to bike in!
Fun for kids and adults young at heart =)
"It's a really nice park, now the made a dog park inside and it's good.."
Good ball games
"Lovely neighborhood park, pet friendly and with lot of space for the whole family."

But if you want to play baseball on a beautiful summer day in the baseball fields don't count on it. Too many people."
"Nice park. Renovated not so long ago. Picknikers and yoga patrons love it. It has a children's park, including wet games, a small place for gym enthusiasts a dog park, a softball semi field public toilets and, my favorite, a dedicated space for p√©tanque game. Dog park is also attached."

Nice dog park.
Coolest park in Hochelaga . !! üèûÔ∏è
Plenty of space for everyone not to step on each others toes.
"A really nice park that has been in renovations for some time. The new water park area is really nice and the baseball field is great, there is also a nice open area that local places use for events, plus a washroom (not sure if it is always open though) and water fountains. Nice to have such a nice park near your place."

Piste de course hyper-bien entretenue. Il y a des toilettes aussi assez propre. Bonne atmosph√®re.
Magnifique et grand parc avec terrain de baseball.
Endroit TR√àS Sal√© mais paisible.
"Nice resting park between walks or bike rides (bike track nearby). There's a table hidden on the hills by the side of the bike track. You can also continue exploring by walking through the grass lanes besides the highway nearby the park and the bike track. Inspiring view of the docks and a glance of LA Ronde by the hidden table on the hill.

My Images below are free to use."
Very nice place if you want to see homelss peaple that need help
Cool
Summer or winter the square is great for kids and dogs!
"nice parc, had a wonderful time there"
Great for children and all age groups peace and quiet also very large choice of play ground for the kid's even old.
Not far from my home and a great place to see the fireworks during the summer free of charge of course just bring your wine and your blanket and you're all set.
"Cute square, stuff to do"
Junky
Correct
"A small park at its natural setting with a 350 meter path going through it along the street, with mostly bushes, rock and trees.
Not much to see, and you cannot even walk your dog there, with a big "" No dogs allowed"" sign. It is a good place to watch birds, however,   arriving from nowhere."
Nice park to take the kids
Quiet place to relax in the shade.
Nice little park. Popular for little toddlers with parents.
Great green space for relaxation
Nice park.

Good for children

"Mad decent parc, right by the Canal, just missing a bit more trees in certain parts that feel exposed on sunny days."
Beautiful linear parc near the canal. Camouflaged heron doing some fishing.
Sweet little spot by the canal for a picnic. There have been quite a few people here during the pandemic (to keep in mind)
Nice place to relax
Good place to sit and relax and wonder where it all went wrong
Well located park. There's a Bixi station right next to it.
"No picnic tables, otherwise nice."
1 of my fav parts of the city. Beautiful residential area near the water and close to Atwater market
Nice day clean park
Cool place to breath good oxygen from the park trees and escape from the noises.
Nice and peaceful
The sunset is beautiful here.
Nice parc. Kids like play there.
Beautiful park.
Bike next to the canal
Cool spot beside the canal.
Good green space in a crowded area
"As far as parks go, it's okay. Not much for kids to do, not much space to play, located by the tracks and lachine's industrial district.

This would function a lot better as a dog park in my personal opinion but I doubt we'd ever see that again. Here's hoping the change will eventually get made"
"I am renaming this park to the Charbanneau Commision Park & Monry Pit...   cost to residents >3million
Looks lovely, after the decontamination,  done at the expense of tax payers...     This park is perfect because nobody uses it...   it is brand new, and i can say was transformed from a dirt pile into a park.
this park was planted after they cleaned up a toxic waste site left  by the builders.  see CHARBANNEAU COMMISION
the residents want their DOG PARK back.
I can say as a resident of 15 years from this local area, Pominville is a very nice enclave of about 100 town homes,  built i believe in 2011

*past notable events.   THE MOVIE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2 WAS FILMED AT THIS LOCATION BEFORE THE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT HERE

THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS A TOXIC WASTE SITE SINCE THE GLASS FACTORY BURNT TO THE GROUND IN THE LATE 70s

I CAN SEE THIS ENTIRE LOCATION FROM MY 2nd STORY WINDOW

JEAN CLAUSE VAN DAMES WAS HERE"
"Close to home. Nice modules for younger kids. Sandbox is not well kept. Basketball net is also a bonus feature. Large and flat grassy area to play tag, ball, etc. Safe. Secluded and quiet with mostly neighborhood kids and families."
"Half basketball court on one side, and children playground on other with a big lawn, benches and tables."

But this weekend will be the peak of the 8ft high Lila Corridor budding on both sides of the bike ride. I am disappointed by the signs that rely on the information on what they say about the animals that we should find in these woods since already in 2011 200% of the birds in the world were dead, do the math and call the nwo, for example any what a mega company that have 3 ""6"" in their logo like google for example, they would be the best place for a consistent response to this strange news. Or Start with the city, they showed us 4 times of flowers that are nowhere to be found but surrounded by lilac no comment on this plant. Go find out. Again, this information is intended for people who can; see, but who are blind. But to challenge totalitarianism which even accesses information about nature on cycle paths, we perhaps deserve the loss of our rights and their grandiose display of domination over us the people. Regardless, this place will make you forget the regret that you all keep secretly inside of you for having had your dose of the ""vacin"". So go out, if you're afraid to go out, bring it with you.

Green Line and Orange Line
It's w metro station Google!
Good metro station man
Easily accessible
Nice metro
THis is my favourite metro station!
"One of my favorite sation, nice design and well maintained and clean, better than some other more neglected stations."
The best Metro transfers!
It ALWAYS gets mebto wherevi want to go!!!
Oscar Peterson Station connects the green and the orange line
They clean it as much as possible and in general you get in and get out. So try to not let it get to you. Let's be real though when it rains this place is a swamp.
Really efficient
Aggressive panhandlers avoid at night!
This place has a intersection of two metro line green and orange which is very useful and also has STM bus terminal that cover West island. It is nearby downtown and clean and decent area
"Nice metro station, however I find the doors at the entrance are a pain. It has a little park, which makes it very pleasant in the summer."
üöà Central hub linking green and orange lines. A bit outdated in its style but I guess the orange bubbly flooring is funky.
"Nice metro station with two floors. Intersection to four directions possible. 1 bus brings you to airport trudeau I believe. However, sometimes in rush hours, everyone is fighting to get in the metro...its the apocalypse each time."
"I liked a lot this subway station because this place has a convenience store, but i not liked a little my visit here because this place has no toilets, the personnel is very nice, friendly and welcoming, but i loved in my experience, i know this station connects with 747 shuttle to YUL."
Stupid questionü§£ Lionel is as usual
"Good metro station. Helpful staffs. Clean, and secured."
"I like this metro station. Even though it's huge but it's all the time clean and well organized. And on top of that, you will still have connection for your mobile phone or tablet. Also, lot of passengers are there all the time,  but waiting time is always less than 5 minutes. Beside that,  you will find seats all the time and they are clean and comfortable"
L'Arbre de vie located inside the Lionel-Groulx station is a truly wonderful idea and gives it a special touch.
"Layout is way less confusing for non-locals than Berri. I always switch lines here.

There's a Cafe Depot and 2 Depanneurs here. There are a lot of buses that pass by this metro too."
"Unlike other connection stations in Montreal, you don't have to walk for 15 minutes to take the metro. In addition to that, the elevators help the handicapped people to take the metro easier. On the other hand, I have taken the metro from this station every single day last year, and the escalators didn't work for at least 2 months!"
"Overall, a great station! Though in my opinion, the system where all of the Northbound trains are on the upper level, and the SB trains on the lower level, doesn't make much sense to me. It has the possibility to greatly confuse people that don't fully understand the concept of this station."
A very convenient transfer for metro and bus. Open spaces.
Key metro station in Montr√©al. Orange and green lines cross. Really close to ATWATER market too. Only Berri UQUAM station more key.
"For such a huge underground structure it sure is clean. Lots of space and offers a great selection of stores like Couche Tard , a coffee shop etc. Also the central terminus, you can get on the Orange or Green Line. Also has an airport shuttle bus and many busses going all over in front. Can be confusing trying to find your bus though."
Awesome metro station with three levels....quite busy station always.... I love the infrastructure.....
It's a fast way to get to Peel
Needs more trees. It's blinding when it's sunny. More benches too. Functionally it's great.
Nice building architecture but the stairs and escalators need to be wider!
Great station. Lots of walking/waiting space and it is kept quite clean.
Great architecture and there are always friendly Panhandlers at the bottom of the escalators to greet you.
Easy transfer between the Orange and the Green lines
"Hard to fine, but beautiful when ya do."
"The busses are never on time which is a mystery since this is the first stop its not like they could have been delayed at an earlier stop... This makes no sense... STM go home, you're drunk"
The best metro station in town
"The best planned of Montreal's four transfer stations, Lionel-Groulx is laid out on two levels, planned in such a way that the majority of transfers do not require the user to go up or down stairs. Since most transferring passengers are either going towards or coming from downtown, the two inbound lines (Montmorency and Honor√©-Beaugrand) are on the upper platform, and the two outbound lines (C√¥te-Vertu and Angrignon) are on the lower platform. That way, most transferring passengers can simply walk across to their connecting train. Plus its wheelchair accessible."
"Favourite subway station, easy to navigate"
Nice and big station.
Not our prettiest metro station but not the worst either
Metro
One of the best hub metro stations
Entrance is a bit sketchy. But overall a nice station.
Best Metro Terminal.
A metro where you can choose from 4 seperate directions
Not too bad
Important junction for a lot of buses
Lots of buses.
very crowded in rush hours
Super!
Cause it's a clean metro
Clean and busy
Clean and easy to find
Decent service
Good station
direction map at station still needs improvement. new people gets too confused from the way it represents the directions of metro
The outside could do with a major cleanup
La meilleure station du m√©tro. Surtout pour faire des transferts de ligne.
"Montreal is Bilingual...Hire people at the Ticket counters who are bilingual. Yesterday, March 28, 2021 at around 7 PM I reached out to the counter at this metro station to get help on Student's OPUS Card and the gentleman knew only French, what a Joke?"
"Great station, well organised and some cool architecture."
INTERNET GOOGLE WEBSITES romel v. rosal
Gorgeous windows and art work
Not accessible.
It‚Äôs a metro
Has a train
Dirty and stinky
"Pretty gross, always smelly, too small for the amount of people."
Coollll
Very crowded and not clean
Good metro station. Eating places around it.
There is good in said a shop i can buy anything i like when bus let i can sit there chears good people love that place
Just had the best club sandwich of my life. These guys know what there doing.
My to and fro from clg.
"Very small metro station and not safe. They just finished construction and for now it's back to order. Neighbour hood is a bit dangerous around. You better choose to use Metro Cote Vertu station instead, and then to walk for 3 to 4 minutes to where you are going as destination."
"Long, neatly kept metro station that has two exits. Make sure you know which way your headed to save yourself 10-20 minutes of extra walking."
Good for public transport for point claire
"Note that there are TWO entrances/exits! The other entrance has no staff, so if you show up there,  you'll have to use the machine to buy a ticket."
"Buses usually on time, quite crowded with students leaving from 4-6 PM."
that escalator eventually needs to get fixed.
Place tr√®s anim√©e avec plusieurs arr√™ts de bus √† la sortie du m√©tro!
"Conveniently situated, near Jarry park and IGA stadium, formerly known as Uniprix stadium.

Clean metro station located on the blue line. Also has bus lines close, particularly the 55."
"The Doors open at 5:15 in the morning, it's freezing outside."
love it
Gorgeous art
A more or less ok metro
this is the worst station of all time but I‚Äôm still thankful it exists. we have to be appreciative of the things around us
Very convenient location. Everything you might need isn't too far
"This station's profoundly dull colour scheme (brown floor tiles, beige wall tiles) wouldn't be so bad if there weren't just so much of it. But the lint-coloured hallways go on and on, taking their own sweet time, up several flights of escalators to finally arrive at the top. The experience is one of excruciating dullness, unbroken by any works of art. The nice new 1999-vintage postmodern kiosk can't do much to save this very boring station."
"It's a metro station, which is useful if you need to get around the city."
Service good but Could have done better
"it's a metro station, no complaints"
The poor part of promenade st Hubert
"Nothing special, just dirty subway station"
Great place!
"Cool station, BUT, if you go to the depanneur inside it, be careful because the guy is really shaddy and he tried to charge me 2$ on my stuff and not give me my bill...  Wich is illegal"
Old and gloomy looking station.
"Pretty clean, recently renovated metro entry and exit"
Very clean.
"Still in construction, but I still love it."
üöà Few steps from station door to platform. D√©cor is a little sad. Needs facelift.
Like that it's a central hub to get to a lot of different areas in Montreal ..even with a train stop and it's been getting a facelift too!
Recent renovations have improved the traffic flow but it's very cold inside during the winter.  Might as well stand outside.
"Best designed metro station in Montreal. Seats everywhere, easy access as the trains are pretty much at ground level and is connects to an exterior train station."
"Service is good in the subway...   It's difficult access in winter as sidewalks are barely cleared....  I've been using it for 16 years, and winter is always been the same.

Otherwise it is a station where one can get quickly on and off trains, and you can almost always score a seat....

But please clear the snow...."
Like others have mentioned the station can get cold and windy during the winter. Yet it remains a great station since there are plenty of benches and station is not too deep down like other stations can be.
"I love that we can review metro stations like it were a restaurant or retail outlet LOL. Montreal's metro system lacks in accessibility and is in serious need of bathrooms. Still, it gets me from point A to plan B after a night out at the bars."
"Might not be the newest looking metro, but the orange line is usually has short wait times between metro. The 105 bus comes quite often. Big plus, the homeless their usually just sit and bum around instead of going up to you and harrassing you for money. You'll seldom see them sleeping there too: big plus due to design and location."
There could be more signage in the tunnel to and from the CHUM hospital. Bilingual would be appreciated.
Not a bad metro.....like all the metros it needs some work...its old.
Metro service is quick and the station is kept clean.
"Good, busy metro station"
It's a metro station. That's all you need to know. Unless you're in a wheelchair. Then you need to know it won't be accessible for a couple years still.
"Not stroller or wheelchair friendly. Always line-ups at the ticket machines, and every morning it's a guess as to whether or not the metro will be running on time."
"This neighborhood area is usually pretty good and bus drivers are usually friendly and helpful but sometimes not so much. Like the neighborhood in general, there seems to be an overcrowding issue and sometimes the grumpier types try to micromanage people who they appear to  feel are less important than they are.  Considering how physically close people are on buses and trains to strangers, it is amazing bad vibes between people don't happen more often than they do. But usually the vendome station is not too bad but very crowded at times so are some of the most popular buses. IMO there needs to be more security on buses and trains not just in the stations because of the numbers of people being squashed together and sometimes it is necessary to push through people to get off at you actual stop. Sometimes on bus there are people who stand on the wrong side of the orange line so when it is dark you could trip over their feet. More often though you can see people stopping to help others with their buggy or wheelchair at this station, which is realy nice. The bus can be super crowded, people stand in front of the buzzer with their hands covering it, other people stand right by the door, when you miss your stop the bus driver will say he is sorry while he drives right by your stop, the person covering the closest buzzer with her hand  looks stunned, and it makes you wonder if they would be more considerate and co-operative if you were French or if the gong show is never ending, because that is how things sort of work here."
Excellent service by STM superb
Easy bus locations
Like metro
Will be a renovation soon to vendom metro
Exelent
Not handicap accessible next to the hospital. Please clear the snow and ice in the winter. It's deadly.
"They're working on modernizing it how ever, still has a ways to go"
You never know  what direction  east west etc the busses are going not indicated
Fair place
Good place
"It is not a handicap friendly station. Not a surprise for Montreal's public transport system, but something to be aware of."
"This was our stop when we visited the Canadian Center for Architecture. The station is not that different from your typical downtown metro station, especially in terms of amenities. And speaking of, there aren't any restrooms here, and you'd be hard pressed to find one within the vicinity since it's located in a mostly residential neighborhood."
IT'S um.. very... nice.... metro station to um.... actually its okay.
Cool metro. Takes less than a minute to reach entrance from inside.
"üöà solid station; clean, decent design"
"Dgdfdfeddsfsvha.

Clean station
Clean and quiet
I live around this area of the metro and too many god damn bums sleep on the bench inside the metro
Despite its narrow stairwells to the platforms and down the tunnel from the street its a very basic stop visible on the street.
Not clean at all
Great night walk at the park
Need major renovations and much needed seats for busy 121 line
Ok.. not bad not good. I see they are doing renovation.. maybe a new upgrade...
"Your ordinary metro station, in need of restoration and more attention, many buses lines among which is 121sauv√©-cote vertu,  180 De salaberry, 140 fleury. Needs some seats for the waiting commuters."
"Station de m√©tro parfaite et tr√®s bien entretenue ! mais..aucuns acc√®s chaises roulantes, ascenseur.."
"VIA  rue saint Catharine street car expo every year in downtown Montreal. Its very good metro station directly you can connect to inside mall itself. adjacent road every year conducting car exhibition on road all branded Porsche Buick, Mercedes Benz Audi Bugatti etc. Always best Canada Metro STM transit Bus and Metro. I recommended it"
Amazing station. Best subway station I used frequently.
Connected to the underground city.
"This is the closest metro station to Mont Royal (the hill that overlooks the city's downtown core) and is situated close to many city attractions. It's nicely designed and modern, just like other metro stations but I can't give it 5 stars because of the lack of restrooms."
Great place .
"A pretty busy metro station in downtown. There are quite a few shops in the hallway leading to Stanley street exit, including a customized t-shirt printing store, a dollar store, a sushi stall and a Indian traditional clothing store. It‚Äôs connected to a shopping mall and to the underground city as well. One thing that I don‚Äôt like about metro stations in general is that in the winter the doors are super difficult to push and once they are open you get  basically blown into the station by the cold wind."
"Spacious and easy to orient metro station. There are many doors connecting Peel station and the signs are generally easy to interpret if you understand French. However, on it he exit towards Stanley street, there are many small ghetto shops around making it a bit uncomfortable for me."
"People are friendly, understanding and fast. If you're a frequent visitor, they will even remember your name and order - making it that much more personal!"
Pretty clean and easy to navigate. They had signed for the fine art museum making it easy to find
Peel metro great place to meet but be careful which exit you are getting out. Easiest way out to go on Ste Catherine is Stanley exit.
"There are circles everywhere in this station: illuminated circles in bright single colours on the advertising panels at either end, circles in the marble of one entrance, circular tiles on the floor. Even the vents at either bulkhead are circular!"
üöà Connects to Cours Mont-Royal and near Golden Mile district. Fun 70s style mosaics
Clean and it's very convenient place since it is in Downtown.
"Spacious, clean and has direct access to the underground city."
Great station to meet with friends and decide where you want to go with friends. In case of bad weather direct access to the undegrownd mall
Next to the best cinema
"Meh, it's ok I guess. Was really hoping for more dinosaurs"
Takes me to the mall and the SQDC.
Needs cleaning. Stinks.
Clean Metro Station. There are numerous entrances and exits to the street and the mall. Be wary of numerous panhandlers at the entrances and exits.
All the big brands of the world are here!
"Connects to Sherbrooke, Peel, and also directly into an underground mall."
pure trash. i like
Clean station.  Only one ticket machine however.
Awesome place.
Beautiful area and decent number of parks...
"Clean and connects with many buses. In fact it is
the terminus for various bus routes."
No person in charge to buy a ticket at 8:30 in the morning
What's awesome about this subway station is that you can experience being outside and inside simultaneously. Meaning that an umbrella is HIGHLY recommended if you you're planning going there while it's raining!
THIS STATION IS ONE OF THE NICEST STATION ADD ITS BEAUTIFUL REFLECTION OF SUNLIGHT BOUNCING OFF THE METAL REFLECTION AND ITS BEAUTIFUL CHOICE OF COLOURS SURROUNDING THE STATION.
"An out of the way metro station in Verdun, you have to really look for it as it is set back from the street in a residential area. Also, blocked with quite a few trees. Keep hunting, you will find it eventually!"
"Lovely station. Quiet, relaxing"
Always clean and quiet !
Clean
True
"Convenient and clean metro station, near the Marc-Favreau library and bike paths.
There are still some construction going on but the elevators are in operation.
Not too crowded these days, hand sanitizer available and always full."
"I was living there for over 5 years and I can say this station is safe,sooo windy during the winter and always under construction. the elevator was fine to be added, but last year one side was closed for I don't know what."
Great hub station and yuzu sushi is straight in front of the metro station!!! A must
How many stations have the elevators from the platforms to the ground level? This station does have the elevators (recently completed) and has been renovated.
The exterior is very nice since the renovations they added an elevator that come handy the only bad think is that there‚Äôs not soo many benches but other than that very good metro
Single exit. Simple layout
this is where you get off to go to the rolls royce dealership
This station is easier to get too and easier to find than those along the Decarie highway.
Good place
The entrace door is very hard to control by windy times.
Decently kept metro station with easy access to the Decarie side ramp.
i like it because i can take the metro
"Modern Montreal metro , a bit too underground lots of stairs"
"Intersting lighting and architecture, but a bit dark."
There should be an other exit on the west side of Decsrie.
i love this place
Great
Well its a metro station
this picture taken inside namur station says a thousand words
WEBSITE DATA  TESLA. HEART DATA.
"As a tourist we went  out of our way to visit this station, as it is highly recommended in many guides. It was not what we were expecting, it is nice looking for a metro station, but would not recommend as a tourist attraction."
There are multiple parking spaces dedicated to Namur metro station
"The escalator is often broken, and there is no elevator leaving many people with disabilities having to walk down a few flights of stairs as this metro is pretty steep. The interior design is quite nice though."
"üëç : One of the more clean metros.

üëé : Needs to be maintained much better. I mean the escalators don't work 90% of the time it is ridiculous. There is gum stuck everywhere it really needs to be cleaned much better."
"The ticket booth workers are of course exceptionally rude, and will completely ignore you.  Doesn't seem to matter if you speak English or French they aren't interested in being civil human beings to answer basic questions about the cost for kids for a ticket etc."
"It a great location. Everything is close to the metro station. Walmart ,Toys R US, EB Games and many more."
"Perfect coffee , nice  sitting place, no noise, enjoyed a lot"
Nicely located and with some relatively impressive interior design.
"Really? Access is perfect, with such a busy point of entry,you think the maintenance could be more vigilant In keeping the premise Clean and the Escellators in proper working condition. The upper Escellators has been out of service for 2 or more years, the lower Escellators is on and off in a daily basis, sometimes in reverse, one works the other not. Then again it's the same nonsense with most metro stations."
I was stranded with a lost wallet and the horrible man at the ticket counter offered no help; not even a phone call. Disgusting. Really tells you about people‚Äôs origins.
Good place
"I stop here for the Walmart, Wendy's restaurant, and Baton Rouge restaurant. A few other places to check out as well."
If you're handicapped forget about the subway so many stairs
"There's always at least one long escalator that doesnt work, if you have babies or a lot of junk from Walmart it can be infuriating."
"this goes for 90 percent of all metros in Montreal
its needs a revamp !!!!!! all those tax payers money where dose it go ?"
This station has one exit..!!!
"I hate STM.
Super unreliable."
It's a great small yet clean station
Entrance and exit on van Horn.
love it
Always was one of my favourite metro stations for its style. It's got a small depanneur and it's usually more on the quiet side unless all the high school kids are out of school.
Nice view and a great neighbourhood
Located at a great location in Outremont and usually well maintained.
Favorite metro station in the blue line.
One of few Metros that doesnt smeel like oil at Montreal
GOOGLE CANADA. R2
Very clean metro station but the escalator is broken more often than not üôÄ
Small station with a d√©panneur

"Right in the middle of a shopping mall, very convenient!"
Night bus!!!
There are still people travelling on the metro line without wearing their masks.
"Blvd. Saint Laurent vs. Near metro saint Laurent!  The area is unrecognizable every 3 months! Major construction developments!
The metro saint Laurent is at the heart of jazz Montreal & other festivities! However the Blvd.  Is a Mish mash of ethnic stores some going back almost 100 yrs.  Including Schwartz of smoke meat fame! Strolling is the right way to see new and old stores. Enjoy the unique experience!"
The 21h07 bus #55N did not pass.
Only 1 exit here
"This is a very plain station. Its large volume, built cut-and-cover, is walled with eggshell-coloured ceramic. The floors are done in brown tile and black granite.

The pale expanses of the walls are punctuated by panels of coloured tiles rising to the ceiling, each panel with a different colour and pattern. Although they are the work of the noted ceramist Claude Vermette, these panels, installed during the station's construction, were originally not construed as an artwork, so that it would be easier for the transit company to remove them if it had decided to do so."
"Ever since that young guy in his 20s was beaten to death in front of this station, I avoid it like the plague. It used to be a pretty hopping red-light district. Now gentrification has pushed all the fun eastward."
Artsy area but it doesn't flow into this staid station. Need more ticket machines in there too!
The outside usually has some insane audiovisual art installations going on
"Clean station, friendly staff!!"
Good
"Ok station, gets you going."
"Over 25 minute wait for the last train, just to miss the last yellow line train to south shore.  Horrible service STM!"
ok metro station
Cool ....
Good size station
"Got drunk and passed out here the other night, 10/10 would vomit there again."
"This station looks old and not represents where the Metro Station is, once you go out of it. Doesn't feel like you are in Montreal."
fast and clean
Of middle of the road quality for a metro in Montreal.
Needs an update
A normal metro station on the blue line. Next to the bus stops and on busy street.....
Not too clean but ok
"Everything is nearby this metro station like McDonald's, Tim hortons, grocery stores and so on."
I really like this metro station. It is right next to the train and the bus stops. Many exits. On busy streets like Jean Talon or Ave du Parc. Very practical.
Sale degeulasse
Nice
Great
This is a very normal metro station.
Perfect place for festivals in Montreal! Best place during summer.
"The smell of urine in the station motivates me to work harder, so I can buy a car and don't have to take the metro."
"Place for the arts, festivals, enjoyment and fun activities to do."
üéâ
Nice station to walk around with a lot of art place to go.
"It's a metro station, very safe but might be super packed during festivals and events in the summer."
Nice station with some art and fun shops around.
"The entrance from Rue de Bleury is always dirty, smelling like urine, and has pickpockets, I've got my phone stolen there. Keep your eyes opened."
"Clean and artful, just like many metro stations downtown, but no restrooms."
The most beautiful metro station in Montreal
Great
"Downtown Montreal, this subway is connected to UQAM University, and Montreal underground city, and you can get to Complex Desjardins by an underground corridor."
"Had a great time here, all part of my journey of the  Underground. This is one of a complex that you can visit when you are navigating the maze hahahaha. First time and it is definitely a little daunting. But had a great experience and would recommend for others to do the same and get lost a little."
First Subway Station on the Green Line I went to when I  arrived in Montreal. It is connected to Complexe Desjardins and Montreal‚Äô famous Underground City. Jazz Festival is always a great event to check out. Jazz Festival is free but your bag gets checked at the gates which are located outside of this metro and they won‚Äôt let people in with glass bottles or unopened pop cans.
"Place Des arts station is the most beautiful metro station!

A lot of art works and educative ones too!"
Good
"This handsome station was built in a large open volume underneath the Place des Arts cultural complex. The platform walls are very attractive. They form an eye-catching zigzag layout and are covered in light-blue bricks of alternating colours (in a pattern similar to one of the architects' other stations, Atwater). The walkways above the platforms seem to float, being supported by discreet hangers at the point of each zigzag. The light colour and stylish architecture let passengers forget that they are underground, and give a feeling of sophistication in keeping with the cultural complex above."
Very clean and easy to navigate. Visually interesting
Nice and clean station just under the Place-des-arts where you can find nice artworks from time to time.
Very helpful staff member showed me everything I needed to know as it was my first time in Montreal
A great art center where artists express their talents good place to visit
"Nice clean station, but no elevator for who need it, also be aware that getting ur ticket there is available only on one side or you should wait your turn on the machine and your train might pass, and even where there is employee it take them more than 20minto hand over shifts"
Excellent üëç
"Beautiful downtown station. Good location to access Sainte Catherine street, complexe Desjardins and festivals during summer."
üöà Very pretty!
"My favorite station, big and a lot of places you can go that is closeby!"
Easy access to the art Pavilion of UQAM
Good
Ok
Great
Correct.
Clean
not nice service for no french speaking customer.
Nice station
CROWDED!!!
üöá
"I pushed the stroller and left the station.  The station staff was gone and no one helped me open the door.  passenger by tried to help me out of my dilemma, but still couldn't get out of it.  It is inconvenient to have no elevator at the metro station, adding more inconvenience to parents with children"
Neat and clean platform but somewhere is dirty also .
"Platform is clean and shiny, but when you go upstairs near the ticket counter place is sometime dirty. One morning, I saw food was dumped near the walls and were smelling bad. Same day when I returned in the evening rotten food was there. Didn't see any changes. Definitely this was because of employmee carelessness !!"
I use this road all the time but a lot of Drug and dealer. So not the safest or the cleanest
"Typical metro station. Reliable service, nice design and art, and conveniently serves the Concordia campus. The exits are a bit confusing."
So far the metro has been great! It's been clean and pretty easy to understand.  The shops inside had some fun Asian bread to try.
"This station is simply confusing as hell. There are two entrances to the metro that are further apart than the train‚Äôs length. On top of that, there is simply no accurate signage. Lastly, for some reason unknown to me, that station is way warmer than other during the spring and fall period. The good thing is the fact that there is always someone playing an instrument there with decent music."
"This is a very lackluster station. Formerly, it was done in the ugly orange-brown glazed tile pattern (supplemented by other tertiary colours) that still covers most of the walls in the access areas. The majority of the platform walls have been done over in a more modern style, with multicoloured glazed tile mosaics over the seats, and white stone floors and walls. Although one cannot deny that the look has been much improved, white walls and floor are about as practical in a metro station as carpet in a hospital, and they have quickly become filthy."
Nice
"It's got to be one of the worst metro stations in all of Montreal. Even though it was just recently renovated, it always looks like it's falling apart and there are a lot of unsavory folk hanging about. It's also always stuffy and hot too.

There's a Tim Horton's and a pizza place which are pretty good and the fact that there's underground access to Concordia is very convenient for students. Wish it was a nicer station though."
One of the worst metro stations in the city. A woman was robbed of her purse entering the metro; do be careful.
"Very well located i.e. close to downtown, restaurants, grocery stores, other shops & Guy Concordia University is connected to the metro. A lot of residential buildings are close by as well. The biggest drawbacks of this metro station are that it's dirty, no elevator, and it's probably the hottest / warmest station."
Stop here if you like the smell of pizza and the homeless.
Dirty spot.. lots of homeless... But I recommend Pizza Bella for lunch
A hub.a centre. Within Concordia university. Restaurants abound. Fast food included. You have to be choosy. The library is close. Print shops plenty. Yet something is missing. It needs an artistic touch into the chaos! Hard to pinpoint. Put some colors into the alleys. The tunnel metro to Concordia needs wall paintings and joie DE vivre. Enough said be an artist or student or business person you have to be in a pleasant surrounding!
"Fully loaded station. The metro part is satisfactory, but the shops and food is top-notch."
Its good but sometimes very crowdy at some intervals of time during the day
Love this metro station because they have a smoking area
"One of the worst metro station in Montreal. Smells like piss and sweat everywhere. Has way too many exits, very confusing."
This station is always kept a little bit too warm and there are often people sleeping under or on the benches. There are also a lot of water leaks that are a bit of an eye sore. The live music can be nice though.
Metro is my favourite to travel through montreal.
The worst metro station. Smells like piss all the time
Vert close To downtown Montr√©al and right under Concordia university. Has a lot of services as a metro station like food and cyber cafe as well as deserre shop of artistic materials
"Very dirty metro, staff isn't always the friendliest either but it's conveniently connected to the different Concordia buildings which is great in -30C weather."
"Waiting on the platforms is very warm, but the convenience of not having to drive around downtown is worth it."
Too hot in winter and summer and too many homeless men.
Overpowering smell of urine constantly. This metro makes it super convenient for Concordia students however the cleanliness is non existent
If you like the smell of hobo piss in the morning this toilet / metro station is for you!
Nice metro station
Be careful not to get lost with their exits.
Not so bad. Great for taking pictures.
Exits get crowded all the time but great location
It is nice. We have a new metro now.
As before good for the late number whom uses
My favorite station =) you can sit in the lobby there is free Wifi
Overcrowded. Hot. Sketchy people. Definetly one of the bad stations
"Good station, a bit dirty but that's Montreal"
Great STM service!
Good cheap pizza there
Good memories of Concordia University.
Great place to take the metro.
"Alright station, weird tile patterns."
If you like strong urine odours and crazy homeless people trying to get a chunk in at your student debt. This is the place for you.
Outlook compared to other metros in montreal is below to them. Need some investment to improve.
"There are small restaurants in the metro station, a tim hortons and a bakery"
Hot crowded and always has a weird smell I don't know people eat from the restaurants in this metro
i got to he metro sat down and 2 crack heads start to smoke next 2 me p.s i wish i was joking
Conveniently located
Review for a metro? Well its a good metro!
Very busy metro stop
Smelly smell smell
"Surrounded by homeless, smell urine all the time, dirty place, unfriendly staffs"
Good metro services
Work place
Fantastic location!
Its okaish.
Stun metro
A metro...
Excellent
"Center of the city , downtown."
crowd at peak times

No one at the ticket counter
Nice
Always stinky
Always construction!

old subway station
Ok

Yes!
This metro station is boiling hot!
"It's always really hot and the station and smells even when homeless people are not there, it really needs to be cleaned out"
It's a metro.
There is a huge construction going on

Not to many people
"Old, dirty and gloomy."
This metro station is a connection point or else I should say it is a small junction which connects other Metro lines. This metro has two lines first is orange and the second is blue line.
"I love how this place make me feel, its like nostalgics one, but i think the owners can make more effort in the cleaning.
But how ever its good to travel from this station"
"A metro station, intersection between orange and blue lines. The whole metro needs renovation. Many facilities surrounding it"
Good station with connections to the orange line.
"it's unclean, and filled with construction."
Awesome
"Intersection between orange and blue line, close to march√© Jean Talon"
westminster st
"Station de m√©tro assez vaste, ou les lignes Bleue et Orange se croisent.  Plusieurs sorties et les couloirs sont larges, pour assurer une circulation fluide. Faire attention aux chantiers de construction qui s'√©tirent en longueur..."
Located in Verdun.
De l‚Äô√âglise Metro. Green line. It has two point of entry. One through the Wellington street and the other one is in De l‚Äô√âglise street.
"Located near a lot of restaurants and other shops, making it a very convenient location. It could be cleaned a little more thoroughly however."
THIS STATION WAS POORLY DONE BY THE TRAINS BEING ONE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND THE BORING CONCRETE WALLS. THE ONLY THING THAT IS VERY ART LIKE IS THE RED/ORANGE WALL RANDOM DESIGN.
"Probably my least favorite station, very dirty, Verdun station is far more better."
"clean, good location, trains always on time!"
Just another depressing metro station
Gym membership has become an increasingly
"On the green line in Ville-Emard area, the last stop before the terminus at Angrignon."
Sometimes rude staff sometimes good
Some really neat sculptures in here but the station is filthy and needs a good cleaning like most stations. The station smells horrible however all the time. Pray to whatever diety you choose that the escalator is in service. It‚Äôs a long ‚Ä¶
"Typical Subway Station. Has some nice structures inside and usually has someone playing music. Sometimes attracts a young crowd , prob from the local high schools, that hang around sometimes but still a safe place. last stop before the  Angrignon Terminus."
I'm rating it one star in hopes that whoever manages this station will improve its ventilation. It is so muggy and the air thickness as soon as your enter the doors is gross. I can't think of another metro station that has such poor air quality.
"Monk is by far the poopiest metro station on the entire green line! It‚Äôs in a terrible location, the air in the station is muggy, the architecture is bad, the walls are made terribly and the benches are unbearable."
It smell like poopoo
"Was living around, it is not very safe and my friend got his bike stolen in front of him, and got no help."
Beautiful!!
I do use often and it's well maintained station. It connects the place where I go frequently maybe that's the reason why I rate five stars :)
Worst station ever. I have seen better stations in under developing countries. Person behind the counter behave like a colonial era clerk. This is not a tourist friendly place!
Close to the new Udem pavilion
It's a metro station - it gets you from A to B
The lights are interesting.
Nice location
If you looking for some actions here is the place to come. Sometimes random crackheads will come out of nowhere and starts going nuts. Other than that there‚Äôs a lot of food places around where you can grab something to eat before going to work.
"Lots of cafe, fast food, banks, grocery stores. You can make a key üîë,  print or copy, send money overseas, cash cheques, make manicure/pedicure. And even more..."
"I use this metro almost everyday.
This is one of the major transfer point after berry uqam.
Orange lines and blue line is accessible from here
Although there are not much shopping centers or famous grocery stores, this place is best for people who wants to pay less living in montreal

Happy journey"
Very confusing metro station. There are many stairs. At least there is an elevator and some escalators. Bus drivers in this area aren't very friendly. Once I was walking out of the station. The bus was waiting there and the driver didn't open the door to let me in. There are only a couple buses that stop at this station. It is not a very practical station. The street always floods when it is raining and the puddles are more than an inch tall. I don't really like this station.
Great in terms of service but not the cleanest one.
"Not the greatest Montreal Metro station, but it does the job quite nicely. Entrance is a little dirty though"
Just installed elevators allow accessible everywhere.. Two lines intersect here.. St Joseph oratory nearby
Clean and well located  always safe especially before dark.
A metro station. Good to catch the metro at.
A good place a lot of facilities
Good transportaci√≥n and some coffe shops
"if you want to cut short from the orange line instead of going all the way around you should take this, as Google maps cannot figure that out and won't give that suggestion."
got shot by a nerf gun.
the blue line needs MORE wagons. The Snowdon metro is glauque.
"Metro station , intersection of two lines. Not the nicest one !!"
"Wonderful place, from these heights we can see the city of Montreal almost complete.
Beautiful place of pilgrimage for Christians."
"We only had two hours in the park and wish we had spent an entire day. The view from the Mont Royal Chalet is a ""must see"" thing for a trip to Montreal."
A good metro
"Everytime I step on the escalator I hope it doesn't break down, or the wind tunnel doesn't knock me down them."
"Its a pretty standard subway station. There is a little convenience type store inside, and outside at least during the summer there is a large tent that sells sandwiches, fresh juices, and herb plants. Like most of the subway station entrances there are buskers and beggars nearby depending on the times of the day."
This station is average compared with the other metro station. They have a bus right outside that goes up the mountain to a viewpoint. Very nice views up there. This station was convenient.
Pretty standard metro station but the area nears the barriers can get congested at time as it is very small. There‚Äôs a convenience store down the escalators
All day it's fine. Peak hour is rough
Very cozy metro and pretty
Wow... place
Perfect
Really good
"There's always someone asking for money here. It's an obstacle course of beggars, people asking for donations, people giving hugs.. be ready to dodge them all like the matrix"
Yes lots of homeless people in this area .We need to find them homes.
"I liked a little my great experience here because this subway station connects to downtown area and the Bell Centre via long stairs, this subway station has also connections to the train station and my dislikes, this subway station is difficult to find in evenings because the doors are locked."
Not very walking worthy but close to city centre
"This station is a multi modal platform where the METRO,  ALL LONG DISTANCE TRAINS, REGIONAL RAILWAY PASSENGER WAGONS and the BUSES network too are interlinked. All those transportation lines are intersecting in this large station of LUCIEN L'ALLIER.
Montrealers are so lucky to have this HUB allowing them to be able to travel and explore Canada from coast to coast. Also, it is possible to travel to USA and much further south.
Thinking of that, it is an opportunity for tourists to be able to come visit our charming city of Montr√©al too. With so many places to see and discover do not hesitate to come over. Montreal is a very vivid city in north America and the first major destination for couples and lovers who want to enjoy life Tranquilo."
Ok.
One of the deepest metro stations in Montreal with three long escalators to get to the top or bottom. One of the two metro stops you can use to get to the Bell Center for any events there. There are multiple street level entrances to the station.
"Working downtown station.

Connected to train terminal as well as the Bell Center.

However the passage way always has a pee smell.
Homeless people reside nearby.

Not handicap friendly, no elevators.

Long distance from entrance to metro line.

Escalators and stairs.

On a slight hill downward the downtown centres.

It's counterpart is Bonaventure station, both used to access the Bell Center on events."
Very nice train station. It is spacious and has good food options.
"People smoking indoors.
Smells bad. Escalators often broken."
Not always clean but the architecture is very nice. Lots of covered walkways and many exits. Connects to Bell Centre.
Nice.
"Ordinary metro, beware, take the escalator up.. there is a lot of steps if you take the stairs!"
One of the least smelly metro stations. Cleaner than most. Helps that it is in the heart of the business district and schools
If you aren't accessible person or travel with a stroller it makes it very hard and difficult but overall the station was nice and clean
Very low station
BELL CENTRE STATION!!!
Very nice
This station changed me
Lots of homeless folks around this place - scary
Nothing special
Its ok
Hi...
"A station like any other, well maintained and even more cleansed thanks to Covid-19"
"There are supermarkets such as Metro, Walmart, and other stores around this Metro. There are also restaurants and take way pizza houses. Good metro for someone who wants to grab something and go."
Well located. Lots of amenities nearby.
"Langelier is a good example of 1970s all-concrete construction. It is essentially one huge vault, presenting a very dramatic, almost sci-fi aspect at mezzanine level where it is lit with rows of fluorescent lights.
The mezzanine looks down onto the platform over a parapet sloped down at an acute angle. The links between platform and mezzanine are made by stairs arranged in exciting angular formations, continuing the space-age design down to platform level. The rest of the station's walls are made up of orderly rows of prefabricated, bracket-shaped concrete units with integrated seats. In addition, ventilation shafts are hidden by attractive, sculptured metal screens by Charles Daudelin."
When I went to the station there were no buses
"This very exciting station is characterized by dramatic rounded shapes in pale concrete and stainless steel, giving an impression somewhere between ""metro train"" and ""starship.""The central volume, built cut-and-cover, is one unified space including the escalators between the mezzanine and the bridge. The lighting, hidden in the concrete, casts shadows onto the high ceilings, adding to the effect.
The space looks down onto the platforms from the bridge and the escalators; the rounded shapes of the barrier and ceiling join to create a rounded window onto the platforms. The corridors to the entrances are built along similar lines."
Cool place a little isolated from the city. But great area for people who enjoy the suburbs.
"One of their staff member was quite rude with me in the presence of my daughter in the bus and insisted on arguing about the Opus card being obligatory for children of 11 yrs old. He even followed me to the back of the bus, making a scene infront of passengers, to tell me I was wrong about the info I read on their price list. This is after i pointed out they must change the details on that sheet in regards to what he had told me.
Quite unprofessional and very harrassing of him.
Stm staff are getting worse by the day and this one was the worst I've encountered.
They need to learn some PR skills along with customer service and courtesy. They also need to learn their own rules and regulations before they start giving off misinformation."
Good place for people that lives out of Montreal. A huge parking where you can park ans take the metro.
Metro
Good staff
Ain‚Äôt a bad spot
"The hand sanitizing stations are always empty, the trash cans outside overflowing, and a lot of unsavory characters loitering around either trying to bum a cig off you, or behaving in an uncivilized manner. Not a safe space personally at night time, almost got mugged there once."
Good place to go if you're looking to ride the metro
"Underfunded metro line, escalators always broken or stopped, no wheel chair access to the metro, yet there's wheelchair spaces in each metro car, almost impossible for parents with kids in strollers. STM only focuses on upgrading the stations in richer neighborhood's"
Good metro station but can get pretty busy during rush hour times
Super good place
Good m√©tro station
Good time at this bistro
Great
"The Beaudry Station was closed for renovations and though this station was clean enough there was a man lying on a bench and looked like he had just wet himself. There was a shuttle bus available but the whole area seemed dirty, smelly and derilect especially the Macdonalds. The Old Port and Old Montreal districts are a lot more fun for sightseeing etc and much cleaner. Leaving this area you felt dirty."
"34 bus going east is never on time. Waited 40 minutes when it was minus 20 outside.
They dont care about their customers that live east. Bus is every 30 minutes at rush hour. Then they raise our passes every year. Pathetic. Bunch of capitalists"
One of the deeper located Metro stations if the escalator is out bit of a trek otherwise pretty clean and centrally located to East End Of The Village when you come out there's a taxi stand and bus interchange as well as a Metro Food Store and small mom top stores surrounding
Basic stop. Area is in Ok not the safest area but not the worst area
The metro has a park just outside with benches.
"At platform level, one's first impression of this station is another initial-system station with mediocre styling and decoration. This strangely-coloured, 1960s-vintage tile pattern, mostly split-pea tan mixed with a variety of tertiary colours, continues all the way along the platforms in the mined trainroom and up the considerable length of the escalator to the street-level ticket hall. The station is saved from being boring by two things. The first is the wonderful and symbolic mural commemorating the great uprising of 1837. The central panel of the mural commemorates Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the uprising in Lower Canada (now Quebec), and occupies the wall at the end of the bridge leading to the Angrignon platform. The other two murals, on the walls between the tunnel vault and the ceiling on either side of the bridge, make up a timeline of the rebellion's events."
Correct.
Unclean.
No mobile network at this station yet :( Also not the prettiest
Clean station for an otherwise questionable neighborhood.
Ugly station
"Has been under construction for at least 6 years to my knowledge. Always dirty, working crews around, unfinished concrete floors and walls, people being rude to the homeless... It serves the function it wants to, by being a central connector for three lines, but so would literally any other metro station if it were built to do so. Good location I guess."
One of the best stations in the metro lines. Connects all downtown and very nice places to visit.
"Bright, newly renovated, less puzzling metro station."
Center of Montreal Meeting place
Nice place for public transport
"If I talking about the inside metro of berri then it is too rushed because this metro is a junction of most off metro station.
If you are punctual and prefer always to be on time then make sure distribute some minute for this place. Reason is too much public.
Also there is Security presents so they guide and help you if you need. Other benefit is that there is also police security available some time for public safety so you are safe over metro station.
If i talking about outside of metro then it is a place and also there is one biggest public library available in that we can use upto two hours computer and also we can borrow books for our reading hobbies. This place is very peaceful and clam for those who are looking for this type of atmosphere and as per my thunking once you have to visit Berri Uqam inside and outside so you will get good experience."
"I was coming from work  around 10 p.m, and I met a guy who was drunk and smell drugs. He started following me....I changed almost 3 times my place in the subway cause He was keeping coming seating next me...I was afraid and hoping  I was going to find a security agent when I will get out of the subway. But I found nobody, luckily for me I met one of my friend , I told her about the guy and she faked accompanying me. It s was awful....think that we should have available security agent in subways especially late evening."
"This station is especial because of the library!! So beautiful, silent and clean! BAnQ was my favorite place to study when I lived in Montreal ü§ì"
"the most important metro station. It connects all of downtown together. If your here, your not lost. It can be a bit grimy down there. protect your wallets."
I give 3 stars because I was looking for ' lost items service' but no sign was neither information or front desk.
Good
The one thing I must say is that subway system in Montreal is amazingly clean! And it smelled great!
Well designed and easy to navigate but not very handicap friendly
Regular subway station. Close from many great places though.
Clean subways at least not the same as new York coney island or cdmx xx
"The Montreal transport system a worthy reflection of the country, Order, Punctuality and neatness are its major distinctions."
A hula hula meeting & metro transfer spot. You can reach the main library from inside. You can get out and walk in the main french quarter of the city st.denis street! Summer the best outside environment! Count the days during summer. Or join the parc just outside the metro.now decide what really you want to do for the next 2hrs. And you can do it while on the spot. The city is yours. Plenty of Gov't offices where waiting is de rigueur. By pass all these and rush for the gay centre to grab a beer or coffee or a light meal. The world is yours for watching. The extra pay is not exorbitant even if you are jobless or homeless. That is in short the other side of montreal you have to experience at least 2x3 times a year. Then you can call yourself proudly I am a montrealer! Enjoy your walks in 4 directions!
"Let's be honest, ton's of people go thru this metro eveyday. I have been using this station as a hub for a few months now. yes, it can be a bit smelly at some places due to the amount of people that go thru that station but I always feel safe. Metros are normally on time (like everybody and everything else in Canada) and people are friendly. There are some construction going on almost all the time but IT'S MONTREAL, there's always something under construction. Out of the metro you'll be on Saint Catherine street, where there is a ton of things to do and some concerts right at the metro's door."
"This station was recently renovated...set in a  downtown location ...connected to the national library, Intercity and USA bus terminal,a university,interchange metro lines,..."
Constant lineups and delays towards downtown. People packed like in Tokyo.
"Well Berri is the only metro station that connects 3 lines in Montreal :Orange, green and most importantly YELLOW that takes you to park Jean drapeau where you have swimming pools and the Famous Piknik Electronik for all those Techno music lover who wanna dance surrounded by nature and trees! Yellow line also takes you to the amazing  La Ronde (a Six Flags park)"
"smells like pee lol, bit its ok"
"Montreal have good public transportation, Berri uqam have elevator and Luggage storage with good price, so you can leave bag there and freely go around the city with metro instead of expensive Uber"
"Its big. You get easily confused. Many people, staff always busy and rushing, drug dealers and homeless people at everyspot asking you as soon as you stop what you want to buy and warning you its their turf notnto buy from anyone. A good place to carry a knife if you ask me."
Good
Place great and many easy.
Being under upgrading in the heart of the village
You have to know this station if you're staying in Montreal for at leats 2 days
Not bad but for a metro station coffee shopsin case you need one quick and more
"Another dirty, disorganized, over crowded metro station, with no police supervision. Did not feel safe there."
Great metro station full of action. Theirs also some small shops to kill time while you wait for people
Does not feel safe
Nice and roomy.
"This station is one of the most importain the city, yet aesthetically is a disaster. Not only it is always dirty but has this overwhelming aura of sadness. The ceilings are grey, the walls are grey, the floor is grey. There is abandoned restaurant furniture collecting dust on one of the exits. With such lack of colours and life, in winter this station is almost an invitation to commit suicide. There are amazing artist in the city, street artist that could bring some light and life to this sad place. Just take the exit to Place Dupuis to confirm this awful dullness, this crying need of color and life. This station does not do justice to the city or the artist that call Montreal home."
"Mean workers...
Crack heads all around...
Worst metro station in all mtl"
Very efficient!!
"Central and crowded, this is the station where most lines cross. And the only station to get on the south shore. Most STM user services are here too."
Decent metro.stop. Get off here if you want to walk the gay village
Good
"If you don't know what to do or where to go, start here."
Excellent full organized station
All you'd expect from a station. Place is pretty big.
Stopped all the time whatever the direction you take
"The central Hub for train transfers, wheelchair accessible with elavators, electric stairs throughout.
Connexions to the central Quebec library and Archives, the uqam university, the central bus fleet station for Orleans and Greyhound buses boutiques and snack stands, free local newspapers. Can be found on the first gound level. This metro station has 4 levels underground. Always very busy place. Rush hours is always packed with commuters , but at least a travelling person doesn't have to be waiting outside for the next train.
Would recommend"
4 starts cause its walking distance from everything. Watch the people. 99% scam artists and thefts.
Good and easy going
Here you get all the metro !!!
Needs to be a bit more cleanner.. montreal metros are dirty and smelly.
Good one
Montreal's downtown metro hub
Access to all points Montreal üòèand very friendly metro employee
mmm scary
Easy to find now
Very clean looking
"Dirty, packed and unpleasant"
I like

Metro
Always busy
Clean & safe.

The station is not very accessible just like many other Metro stations in Montreal.
Cool
Slow service
Seems to be in a perpetual state of construction.

Your way
Wonderful
"It's a hot day, summer time around 6 pm so people are almost out of downtown it's not crowded outdoor, people are in car or in the sub-city since Montreal is the second largest underground city after Moscow."
"It is kept clean all the time, which makes it for me to take public transportation everyday. On top of it. I love taking public transportation for my everyday needs. Every metro station in Montreal has different Architectural design, That is such an awesome thing to see for the first time visitors."
Restroom and notice board for buses there..
The metro was very proper and has exits on both sides of a busy street which makes things super convenient!
Not bad
I had such a wonderful time with the whole family. We got snow cones and I my son ate a beetle. Recommended destination.
An average well located metro station. I had only good experince with it.
Lovely place
"Two entrances, one on each side of the highway  Autoroute M√©tropolitaine."
Bus 100 never shows up on time especially on saturday... I've been waiting for 50mins = 1 hour later at work
I hate this place
"Although the station itself is at the Northern side of the highway, there's an entrance on the Southern side with an underpass."
An average metro station but a pain to drop people off at
more infrastructure  changes are happening now to bring it to the standard of downtown stations
One of metro station wich is almost well is a place to chill outside is kind of a parck  from Mars ....
"Big Station, near lots of interesting place"
"Tonight something special happened to me. I think I have been of some use to a man that just had received the diagnostic of a serious cancer. He needed to talk, I think that I almost said what he needed to ear. It's been a good human contact, that it's rare to get when one's busy.

Also, there is an interesting  exposition that is called Citoyenne inspirante"
"I liked enough my great experience here because this subway station is beautiful and colorful, this place is well maintained, this place is accessible to wheelchairs and this place has underground connection to the CHUM hospital. But, i considered this station a little cold when i going in winter."
"If you're planning to visit the Old Port, Place Jacques Cartier Square, Bonsecours Market, and the City Hall area, make this your stop. It's still quite a walk to get to these main attractions and the uphill terrain does not help, but it's better than taking a cab for those without a car. The station is clean overall and the public art did not disappoint, but there are no public restrooms. The closest ones are at at Place Jacques Cartier or Bonsecours Market."
Nice bright and clean station with elevator access
I loved this place because the things there were awesome
"Very clean, gets you to Chinatown, Old Montreal and other interesting places. Named after the God of War (Mars) but the windows are great and appear to be designed for peace time."
"Situated just outside of the eponymous metro station, this area is a bit of a misnomer. Where is the field... nobody knows! It most likely refers to a past battleground or such historical event. There is a tunnel on can take to be directed to the Old Port."
A favorite of my husband and mine. It's a great station to get to historical parts of Montreal.
best station on the system. dosen t feel cavernous.
a bit out of the way in old Montreal but still very close. lots of traffic in the area with construction
"This is the metro station to get to Hopital St-Luc, a CHUM hospital. There is an underground passage from this metro station to the newly renovated hospital. Clean, we'll directed metro station at Sanguinet and Viger streets."
Great location metro station
Very nice subway station.
Very nice.
Superb
"M√©tro station, under construction"
"I mean, it's a metro station but if you go down the back south side, tons of cool graffitis and it's literally twenty second from a park.

Some people need to know this for easy access to greenery."
We did the full tour good walks around the river
"This is easily one of the metro network's worst-looking stations.
From the unbearably boring expanses of flat yellow bricks, through the strange brown dots and orange tiles in the stairwells and the dumpy twin entrance buildings, to the monumentally tacky stainless-steel-and-coloured-glass-blob mural in the mezzanine (Th√®me des mouvements du soleil, by the architect), one has to wonder how this station got off the drawing board."
"One time I woke up from a hard drunk in this metro station. I was having trouble walking and my pants were missing. The kind man working in the little booth told me he was just opening and he was surprised to see me there. He was also surprised that I had no pants. He was very helpful. He gave me a plastic bag to wear like a skirt and let me ride the metro home. Of course, my keys were in my pants' pocket so I had to break into my house through the screen. That was okay though because the screen was already full of holes because I used it as a filter in my hash pipe. Good times."
A lot of homeless people outside this station for some reason and this station is not very nice in appearance
It's a metro station
Shout-out to the ticket guy that payed for my ticket after getting my car towed. Thabkyou! He even asked me if I've eaten tonight :) which I did but the depth of kindness shows.
"Normally clean and calm. A bit crowded between 7h30-8h30 during schooldays since the school is right next door...
Only one exit so it's a great meeting point."
"NOT AT ALL special needs friendly, no elevators and lots of stairs. Snowden is the nearest special needs friendly station, and it‚Äôs not a small walking distance. Lots of good bus connections/lines though."
my favourite metro station. i give it 5 stars
I love this station. It is well maintained and fun to travel in.
A great station with many bus connections to all over Montreal!
"very deep station with a large section wo lift or escalator, exit only on one side"
Lots of stairs you have to go through to get to the top but nicer than average station
"üöà Gotta love those weird 70s style red-yellow gradients. Yes, many stairs."
Lots of stairs but good bus connections.
"Great ambience, affordable prices, this place is truly the pinnacle of public transportation. Wow"
God station lots of color.
I saw a rat here once. It was clearly waiting for the next metro car.
As some times
Good acoustics
"It is too bad the station dose not have elevator.
It is too hard with baby stroller.üòè"
Kind of a crummy place really.
"Lots and lots of stairs, but that's typical of the montreal metro."
Meh
Good
Great
LIKE IT'S NEIGHBOUR DE L'EGLISE THE STATION HAS NOTHING VERY INTERESTING ASIDES THE VERY BEAUTIFUL STAINED GLASS WINDOWS. THIS STATION IS THE DEEPEST STATION THE WHOLE ENTIRE NETWORK OF THE STM.
Very well located between the Lionel Groulx and the Lasalle stations. I stop here everyday on my way too work. I was once asked very politely if I wanted to buy weed there. Although I still can't figure out what bus stops where to what direction.
"The station is small and plain overall, but enjoy the stained glass windows along the escalators."
I love charlevoix metro it's so pretty and very Interesting I'm doing a geography history project on the metro
My favorite station in the network and I love the escalators
"Pretty windows, clean"
"Beautiful station with stained glass, but the smell is awful"
The vitrages
Nice
Bus routes are bad timewise and frequency
poor station
"Very well light, interesting fun architecture and easy access with no twisting staircases and tunnels. It makes taking the metro a better experience."
Well enlightened with day light
Nice eady acces secure
Simple
"The place is low with 2 persons and no smile and thanks see you later and have a good day, they always forget the napkin and the sauce and give me the wrong sandwich and never have what you need. I don't know why they exist because l love the foods, thank you."
Very useful because it has a train to take you places. Much recommended!
Very nice!
"This is a really good-looking station in between two complete turkeys. For one thing, it includes one guaranteed winner - sunlight. A large kiosk, entirely windowed, lets sunlight flood through the great volume down to platform level. The station is no less attractive on the platform level, even under the shadowed areas in tunnel and under the mezzanine level. In the latter, wall panels in vivid rainbow colours liven up the darker area. Resolutely modern light fixtures, whose bright red-orange metal shades repeat the similar materials on the skylights up above, provide a more practical form of illumination. The only real problem is the awful styling of the entrance pavilions, especially the main one on the south side of rue Hochelaga, which sprawls out in Raymond-Pr√©fontaine Park looking for all the world like a giant yellow tractor tread or caterpillar or something of that sort. The glazed roofs also have a tendency to leak. But even there, the attractive concrete decor inside the entrances partially makes up for them. The entrances aside, this station is a modern and exciting space through which to travel."
The place to be if you need to go somewhere
Close to home.
Close to a few restaurants
Just station
"Very convenient, pretty and a small hub for the community. Pianos and farmers market most of the summer and fall!"
Nice subway conveniently located.
The best
"Small metro station
Local market sets up on Thursdays after work
No service once on the platform
Pretty much the only station like this from cote-vertu to that point"
very convenient station
"The spot where the metro is located is quite nice, but the entry itself tends to be ridiculously crowded and dirty"
"It's a metro station, gets you places"
I love the convenience of the local m√©tro stop but wish that there were less people smoking inside the entrance of the m√©tro. I also would love for there to be less solicitors.
Cool
"I love Place Saint-Henri,  Bon accueil food bank is a place full of heart.  The streets are super colorful there is street art everywhere I also like the stores, taco restaurants and barber shops. Homeless people at the station is something you don't want to see and it's heartbreaking when the cold season starts."
Amazing place
The metro is always shut down
"Place Saint-Henri!

It's probably the subway station in Montreal i've been the most, It's actually a very nice place! pretty clean most of the time, very nice staff, they is a electronic station for buy/refill opus card, they're also a convenience store! It's overall a very good subway station!

Sadly it's not wheelchair accessible at all, lot of stair, no elevator too."
It's a metro station. It's not that awesome to look at but it's very useful for the local residents. Easy access from Notre-Dame and St-Jacques. A few buses stop here. Street parking and a small pay lot behind the station. This station is NOT wheelchair accessible.
Lots of stairs but good service with a clean setting!
"It‚Äôs a metro station, and you will always have to take high stairs to reach the ground, so not really wheelchair accessible nor could it be an ease on those days when u decide to carry a whole cart of grocery around..."
Ok place
It better and taking your car
Escalators breaks down once per month for 3 weeks
Nice
"Like most of STM Metro Station, Henri Bourrassa stands out!"
Always under ongoing construction. Access is terrible
"2h28 am, a bus #380 announced but never shows up. Every friday night its the same. OK Google, please cancel this bus info and nobody should trust Montreal public bus system!"
"it's a montreal metro station , what do you expect !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 star is more then they deserve !"
This is a nice big station that has been recently renovated.
False directions.
Not what it used to be after the opening of the stations in Laval but well deserved by various buses.
Easy access
"The whole mtl transit system is crumbling, one of the worst i ever had to deal with!"
Not the cleanest station
A nice metro station with a high escalator
they have indoor benches to sit inside the station.
Close walk to Jewish hospital
Invariably smells like farts.
"This metro station (green line) brings you straight to the heart of Montr√©al. McGill metro offers numerous exits, three of which bring you to major shopping centres. If you are a McGill student, you are also not too far from the Arts Building (a 2-3 minute walk). My only warning would be that if you have classes in the Education or Stewart Biology buildings, it would be easier to get off at the Peel metro station."
Cool !!!
"Conveniently serves McGill and the surrounding college neighborhood. And like other metro stations, you can't help but notice the fantastic station design and art. But why or why are there no restrooms here? Sure, you can go to a restaurant nearby, but restrooms are ubiquitous in many modern metro systems around the world, and not having them anywhere in the Montreal metro is a real shame."
Solid location in downtown Montreal. Not sure why so many reviews suggest it's confusing to get around. There are plenty of easy signs with directions. Connected to the Bay store on St Catherine Street and you can access pretty much every place you need to go.
Metro station witg lots or pokestops and gyms around it. Easy to find a raid group.
"Mcgill is considered one of the top universities in canada! Great studies for international students. Great variety of departments. If i like to be student for life time i will choose mcgill. Great institution. Love the free public lectures. Great campus life specially in summer. Lovely spot heart of downtown montreal! Bilingual to some extent yet english speaking university. The university should initiate more public action on climate change, eliminate homeless, support decent residences for students, be pro-active to eliminate government bureaucracy, project plans for  better utilisation of natural resources! Unknown to many the quebec province holds 8 million people and its geography is larger than france! If the university does not educate its own population who will take the lead! Over all every year new initiatives are expected to solution our social issues! I rest my case but great educational institution!"
"Very nice metro station leading to several important venues in Montreal. It is also linked to a vast network of underground stores that caters to plenty of interests.

Just a warning however. There is currently a trend of people asking for a paper 5$ or more in exchange for their 2$ and 1$ coin. They won't let you look closely at the coins because they are actually 1 Pesos coins which are worthless."
Normal metro station inside. It is convenient if you want to go into the Eaton Centre. It was clean.
ü§î I just learned you can use emojis in reviews üíØüíØüíØüíØüôÉ
Nice metro station but way too many homeless people sleeping around giving an awful smell of  awful alcohol in winter nights. No clue how to solve the problem but just letting you know. Also there is a scammer around there pretending to be new and lost asking for bus money.
You are a genius if you somehow manage not to get lost here
Convenient to get to the mall without going outside
Great school!
"This handsome station is the busiest in the network, at over 10 million passengers annually; it is right in the heart of downtown Montreal, serving many shopping malls and office towers as well as the university that shares its name. It is a key component of the Underground City and an exhibition space for several important works of art."
The Best
It's OK but please clean up better
Old metro stations yet still functioning properly
"Mcgill Station, is on the Green Line and is connected to underground city/interconnected shopping malls/Office Towers which includes Promenades Cathedrale, which is under the beautiful Christ Church Cathedral, the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal. You can also walk underground to Peel Station, also on Green Line,  walking by famous brand name stores and food courts. You can also go to the basement food court in Eaton‚Äôs Centre and walk through to Place Ville Marie and arrive at the Central Train station. Walk further you get to Place Bonaventure where you will have access to the Orange Line via Bonaventure Metro. The Atrium indoor skating rink is above the Bonaventure Metro.

Many of the stores near the Mcgill Metro are selling a lifestyle surrounded by beautiful things accompanied by beautiful people wearing beautiful things; then you have the uncomfortable experience walking around all the homeless people and all you can think of is due to the Grace of God  go I."
"The metro itself is very good, frequent service and clean, but the station is very confusing in terms of getting to or from the street."
"Very bad  service at the ticket counter.
My son accidentally exited the station in front of the ticket counter and he requested the clerk to re enter but was denied and told to buy the ticket again."
BACK UP DATA
üöà hub to underground shopping and downtown
Correct.
Its a beautiful station that you hardly feel isolated or lost in.
Nice place
"Very practical because it is right in front of the university. There are not many bus that stop at this station. It is now currently under renovations. It's a good thing because this station is not very good looking. The colors that they chose to put are ugly in my opinion. Overall, great metro station."
"A scam!!! the escalators is a work in progress for 2 years.
Even STM employee joke about that
Another waist of our money and extremely inconvenient.
Should ask for rebates at this station for this abnormality.
Favre and jean Talon suffer same scandalous inefficiency."
Super m√©tro yay
To much Stairs
"Loved exploring the Downtown Montreal area. Beautiful architecture in a central, walkable area. Take your time and simply stroll along Rue Sherbrooke (2nd longest, iconic, hip street in Montreal)."
A bit better looking metro station.
In a somewhat convenient location. Feels like it could use some cleaning
It is a general Montreal subway station. Though there is lots of graffiti on the entrance of Rue de Malines.
"Good for getting around the city, nice shops nearby."
Strong wind in winter
Great geometry!
"Good distributions but is one of the ugliest stations in Montreal, and the bus are never punctual."
Good!
Its clean always a bit empty but the workers there are always really rude one time its was really late and i needed to go home and was short on 5¬¢ and the cashier refused :(
Downtown station
Needs cleaning
"üöá Many underground tunnels networking around high-end downtown business core. Clean, safe and well maintained."
"Usually, I don‚Äôt have a problem going to this metro station but today, an old man that looked mentally instable & homeless was wandering around there. As soon as I saw him, I avoided eye contact with him but he said some remarks that I would consider racist. Beware of him!"
#montreal the beautiful
I like their services very much. They are quite professional and hard-working. When ordering something online it allows me to track the current location of my products.
Huge enterprise and a good many shopping plus a major hotel. The alley is historical and majestic. Plus lots of photo opportunities and a lovely water reservoir. All to be seen and depending on time available enjoyed by sitting and walking around . access to a Victoria metro is a bonus. Would hope that the long alleys would give opportunity to display art or street art or artist rendition of use of space. You need time to explore the surroundings. The alley or corridor include coffee houses  for a stop over. W.c. is accessible. Enjoy the long walks!
For the first train its calm
I like the open concept.  Really bright and lovely....
One of the nicer Subway entrance in Montreal. Easy to get lost with the amount of exits however. Orange line fine access all through the city.
"Good looking Metro Station, good to explore Montreal's underground."
"Easy to navigate, recommend take a pic of the map to carry with you for the rest of your journeys"
Nice place to visit
A lot of underground tunnels conecting with place d'arme and other centres
Nice square in Montreal
Guimard !!
It's a normal station!
"Restrooms were closed probably because of covid-19... Come on! Why don't you just clean it more often/ allow 1 person at the time/ whatever... For most of STL busses, if you miss it, you're stuck there for an other hour or so. Not very pleasing when you have to go -_-0"
"Good area to drop someone off, pick someone up, park for a day. But at night lots of junkies shooting up in the bathrooms.. A great metro station!"
"Clean, and nice architecture. Faster than driving in Montreal. Helped us avoid traffic during ile soniq

Update now only giving 3 stars because customer service only spoke french to me. The guy behind me translated what he said.... this is not the first time workers was like that in Quebec"
"Very clean, reliable metro station. I take it every day"
"Rude agent behind the ticket booth, and also if you already have a monthly pass from the stm you'll have to pay another 3.25 (even if you had the reduced price) like why we have to pay double when we already have payed for a 4 month pass with the STM."
-35 you wait while the bus drivers are chilling and reading their dumb newspaper
We waited 50 min to open subway aga≈ün she didnt wait us just 1 sec!!!!!
Nice subway. Good connectivity with the city
An awesome place to park and protest in support of immigrants!
Good
Fine
WATERGATE. SQUARED DATA
"I used to use this station everyday to go to work.  The station is often slow to get cleaned - there was once an empty box of Tim Horton's muffins on the seat I'd usually wait on that didn't get cleaned up for three days.  The two d√©ps at either end are very messy and expensive.  Every once in a while, treat yourself and wait for the train at C√¥te Sainte-Catherine - that's a nice clean station.  It's a shame that the train in such a poor neighborhood is as neglected as this one."
This metro station feels hastily made/designed. There's no elevator and the escalators are frequently broken. Needs renovation.
The hood!
"Block long Metro station with entrances at both ends (Google only shows the main entrance). The main entrance is at strip mall in an area with a high Filipino population, so don't be surprised at hearing Tagalog spoken or finding some great Filipino restaurants in the area. This is NOT one of the few stations with disabled access and I find the many stairs to be murder on my arthritic knees."
Many shops and groceries at this place..
I once saw a dude pooping on the train platform here. It went splat. Four stars for being decent. One off for being pooped on.
It's gotten a lot better now that there are new lights in place but there are still improvements to be made.
It's conveniently located for my needs with many restaurants nearby
Good design as it have access from all around the area
"nothings special about it , long walks ( but one thing they can do about it , is to make those long walks interested , if your asking me how ? i don't get paid like they do if i did then i would tell you how )"
"Plamondon Station is really poorly maintained. The escalator has broken since three months, so free workout every dayüòâ."
Google ignores the entrance of metro Plamondon from Barclay/Victoria and gives you only the one of Van Horn/Victoria which means a long path when you are walking from barclay / cote des neiges towards metro.
"Good location, but it is filthy."
"The station is ok but it needs an elevator.
The area has a lot of old people."
Good service and clean!
Metro entrance is here.
Usual
Need improvement
Dirty and old
Thanks
Need improvement and cleaning.
Always problem in the escalators
Smells like toilet all the time.
"walked in, nearly got blown out."
"With it love about this station in particular is that they have something that few metro stations seem to have: a departure  board (electronic ) . It lists the buses that pass through, and lists the times for the next bus! Something so simple, yet so convenient.  It even lists the times for the next one..."
It is located in the C√¥te-Saint-Paul district in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal.
Probably one of the smallest and simplest stations on the network. It's great to be able to see the sunlight from the subway dock.
Best station if you work downtown. Lots of parking space around compared to the rest of the stations nearby
THIS STATION IS A VERY EASY STATION TO GET AROUND AND HAS A LOOK LIKE ANGRIGNON WITH THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT THAT REALLY SHOWS THE BEAUTY OF THE STATION PLUS THE ORANGE TRIANGELS ON THE PLATFORM.
"Convenient, mainly near METRO."
Nice station with lots of windows and sunlight.
I live in between Verdun Station and Jolicoeur Station. I always choose to go to Jolicoeur (especially when going towards Angrignon) because you get natural light and cellphone signal.
Super clean!
Clean station
Gorgoeus skylight
"The Verdun Metro is in the Green Line. The Station itself looks good. This review is base on what I see and it might be different experience to other reviewers.
.
WHAT I LIKE:
* The metro looks good and nice feel when it is not crowded.
* Can easily transfer to the other side of the station.
* There is a small store.
* ATM machine
* STM Reloading machine
* Telephone
* Escalator
* Bus schedule
* Staff on site
* Place to put your Bicycle.
.
WHAT I DON'T LIKE:
* There is no elevator. It's good to have to assist elder person, disabled and etc."
Very nice city
"Ahhh, verdump..... Gotta love it.  Behold the well to do on lasalle boul.  Avoid 4th ave.  Enjoy a Coffey at any of the 100 available in a small concentrated nouveaux hipsters area.  Moving day is also a treat."
The station has all the necessary elements and has entrances on both sides of the road.
"Access for disabled people needs HUGE improvement here (and many other places in this city), however this metro does have one very good thing going for it. It does NOT smell like urine. You know there are certain metro stations which always have that smell, this is not one. Close to many amenities and places in Verdun. On the green line.

Pretty dirty unfortunately, the railings and stairs don't seem to get cleaned much, but it's regular 'city' dirt and nothing particularly weird or overly icky. No amazing public art inside, but if you get out here, check out the Monument Aux Braves De Verdun just outside the metro, it's a lovely public statue."
station is ok but... the cleaning service ... omg if that's how they clean imagine the house .... LOLL the stair are only mechanical to go up and down which sucks for parents with baby cribs plus must of the time they are blocked which no one does anything about for no reason cause so person pressed the button
THIS STATION DOES NOT HAVE MUCH IN IT ASIDES THE PURPLE AND ORANGE STRIPES ALL ALONG THE WALLS OF THE STATION  AND THE BORING YELLOW RAILINGS AND STAIRCASES AND ITS BORING WHITE TILE FLOOR.
The tunnel is long but it is very old.
"If the abundance of homeless people that linger outside the metro aren't enough to deter you, the 10 minute long ""iconic"" moving walkway ride sure will."
"I've been taking the Metro at Beaudry station daily for ten years.  Station entrance is modern and colorful, but underground isn't very clean and there are often homeless (though harmless) people sleeping on the seats, some of whom sometimes smoke. I've nicknamed this station ""Hotel Beaudry""."
Add hours to so people know when it opens and closes
It's not a stretch to call it the worst metro station in the city.
Love that place
"Cool metro, colorful people. :3"
Cool elevator
Closed for renovations until June 2019.
ALWAYS smells like sour vomit...
Metro station with one exit
Scary place after dark. Interest characters hang out here.
so nice
Not a bad spot to bounce from if it‚Äôs busy and you‚Äôre getting out at JT since it‚Äôs so close by
"It's clean and simple. There is a convenience store in the Papineau-Jean-Talon exit and a fast food/convenience store in the second exit. Be warned that the second exit (Fabre street) doesn't have a salesman in the booth, only the automatic machine for tickets."
"Exciting stuff going on there; train go in, train go out, where does it go?  Nobody knows!"
"Horrible metro station, the mechanic escalator has been broken since 2015 almost 3 years now, lots of mice running around when it's a rainy day and lots of beggars recently."
Wrong position on map.
i love this station
It reminds me of Europe. I love it cz it feels like a maze hahaha.
Great memories from my childhood's skating rink.
Still everything is closed with a few restaurants open
Very cool and clean
Very nice station. But very centred so it's hard to board in rush hour.
"It's the one of the main station to taking shuttles, but i not liked my experience here because one of the people seen here is rude with me and i getting lost in this station. But i considered this place enough modern and clean. Due to my experience, avoid this station mostly of your time."
Good train station. A variety of activities. You can speak English or French here
Very busy during rush hour but manageable.
"NOT handicapped accessible!!!  No elevator.  You put your life in your helper's hands going up the two separate escalators to ground level.  A TERRIBLE experience.  What was even worse, the security people could not even tell us which stops WERE accessible."
"The place is massive, easy to get lost.
But the staff were nice, even if I couldn't speak French."
"This is a very central station, very downtown, it looks very great and there are often a lot of people. If you want to buy tickets there are machines and sellers."
The metro station is on the orange line and connects to the Place de Bonaventure which is a huge meeting  place and easy place to get lost in. Bathrooms are upstairs on the same level as the indoor ice rink and food court.
Very busy during rush hour but manageable. I think it would be nice for the signs to be bilingual especially for the millions of tourists. Also the metro is french only while leaves the rest of canada and america clueless.
A beautiful building with access to peel and bonaventure station.
The place is clean and signs aren‚Äôt confusing.
"Lots of clothes stores, not too many places to eat."
Nice place easy to find your way
"A Montreal landmark that now serves as a mix of business related events and parties, and a corridor between the train station and downtown offices. Aside from offices in the periphery, has a cafe and barber shop. Nestled between the Bell Centre and Place du Canada."
We were on our way to Megabus.
Beautiful old building.  No doubt a controversy to name it after the Queen.
Clean safe place to wait for a bus
orange line
Heritage building.

"Not the best station early in the morning. Crowded, dirty, but it is what it is."
Smells like urine in the station
"Trains, metro, restos and stores"
Clean metro station. Brand new trains.
Low price and very clean space.
Best
Safe and clean.
Such a hard time for baby stroller or wheelchair
Cool
Passage in time!
Ben correct
Nice and easy
Great
The monk was very friendly...
Nice old place!
Nice place
it's a big metro station
It surprised me by how quickly it took us into the convention center. Nicely located right by the coffee shops. Had a good experience.
NO REPLY SUB STATION RESO ALL CONTACTS. ALL ACCESS
"üöà Creepy people, poorly lit, nice tiling, well connected to old port and convention centre."
it was great to go back there again
It‚Äôs a very well organized metro station and you can find lots of foods and coffee places inside it. It has a nice hall with piano and you can play it if you feel like it! Also there is a ping pong table as well!
"Montreal was a nice city, but what's the point in a customer service desk if they can't help you at all and are rude about everything? Horrible experience with the metro staff. Other than that the city is nice!"
"Decent station, conveniently serves notable tourist attractions such as Notre Dame and Chinatown. No restrooms, but there are some above ground by the food court at Les Galeries du Palais. Felt a little uncomfortable seeing some sketchy characters roaming around."
"A mid-age woman staff at this location is a total RACIST. Pretended that she doesn't speak English and doesn't know what is a MTL city pass. When I got a MTL staff on the phone, however, she suddenly 'remembered' how to use these passes.
Too bad they don't have name tags, otherwise I would definitely file a formal complaint to STM."
"English vs French?
Public art statement of historical pioneers from Europe represented by bronze statues of a male with an English pug and a female with a French poodle. Read the plaque explanation."
"This is a well connected subway station. Lots of exits going to Old Montreal, Old Port, Palais  de Congress, Chinatown and underground city. Usually very busy and relatively clean."
"One of the grosser, more jankily-lit metro stations. Which is weird since it's connected to the convention centre and the Old Port. Also - once, the ticketing guy yelled at me for speaking English. Like, OK dude, why don't you go be a ticketing guy in some other part of town less touristy and multi-cultural because you're obviously unhappy with your life."
The station is usually kept proper and there are washrooms available during the day at the Palais des congr√®s which is attached to the metro entrance.
"Look, i'm an NYC guy. I was amazed about how clean the subways can be kept. I can never go back to regular old NYC subways now. Thanks a lot."
closest metro station to old montreal. close to china town.
"We used the rapid transit to and from the botanical garden. We travelled from Place-D‚Äôarmes (orange line) to Pie-IX (green line). For $12, a couple got a pair of Presto-like cards. The subway smelled a heck of a lot better than my TTC; however, its cars were un-air-conditioned. Yeesh. Indeed, the wheels are rubber truck tires (a quieter ride... but that must be expensive to maintain). The tunnels themselves are well lit (I was surprised to see graffiti within the tubes [youth with a death-wish?]). Anyway, the routes are colour coded and intuitive. I'll use it again."
"Nicely located within the Palais des Congr√®s with a few boutiques and food courts like located on the main floor. Quick access to Chinatown, Montreal Underground, and close to the Old Montreal."
"This square is located near the St and Notre Dame Cathedral being a meeting place. Here finds the statue of the founder of the city of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey. It is a point of departure from OLD Montreal's street network"
Nice metro station located in the heart of downtown MTL
"Standard station, clean enough and good signage."
Great place but slightly confusing for a Newby with all the different levels
Superb station great place to hangon
Love the Margaritaville
Great!
Entrance area is dirty. Inside not clean.
Nice organized
"Clean, inviting station. Not as busy as it usually is, but that‚Äôs fine."
We need more space for parking spot.
Doesn't stink
Solid metro stop.
We luke the Garden
Best metro station
Clean place. Train is usually on time.
Good
The station itself is fine and clean. Lots of people and then only problem is the staff down the metro ticket place. It‚Äôs like they hate you. But other than that it‚Äôs fine. Very weird people sometimes...
"Five stars or no stars depending on which floor you are on.

The agents upstairs for bus tickets are always helpful, funny and friendly. They are happy to serve you. I'm glad that they are there.

The agents downstairs for metro tickets are dismissive. They think you are another burden they have to deal with. I hope that AI will be good enough to wipe them off the face of the Earth soon."
Nice place for meeting people or resting and relaxing. Except none of that by this Covid outbreak..
"It stinks so be ready for your hair and clothes absorb the smell of all the restaurants there. The shops inside are very cheap and not legit. But it is easy to find your bus, the security staff is helpful. There is also a big screen that shows your bus section and the time that your bus will leave or arrive, and that is genius."
"Pretty well organized bus terminal. Connects right to the subway (yellow line to Montreal).
Also a very common spot to pick-up/drop-off ride-shares.
There's a Tim Hortons, Subway, a couple convenience stores as well"
Not so casual !!
"It has easy access to Bus terminal, however, it is not qualified for disabled and old people due to lack of lift or escalator. People has to pay extra for using monthly pass of the system if they want to use the same system of metro from Longueuil station. STM forgot paying attention to the large community who lives here and only increase the ticket annually.
Trains are old and noisy. Their HVAC system is totally down and you may experience a freezing weather in winter and choking in the summer time.
The worst situation of STM metro stations is here after Berri UQAM station. Entrance of the metro station is a collecting point of juveniles who are drunk or smoke everything. Outside of the station has a disgusting smell of alcohol and smoke. Also you may experience a similar condition of bad smell of food cooking inside of the building."
"This place feels brand new. It's hard to figure out where to lift someone if it's your first time there, but it's fine otherwise!"
Great view
"my boyfriend had the worst experience at the subway restaurant in the longueil terminus, the service was horrible he was treated with no respect and the employee had messed his ordre multiple times , i am so upset with the service and the way this employee acted this women should be put is her place!!!! .Me personally i wouldn't recommande going to eat there. YOU DONT EVEN DESRVE A STAR I HAD TO PUT ONE TO POST THIS !!!!!!"
Easy to find your bus or train
"There's plenty of parking and lots of eateries above the station. But the one reason I don't like it is that it's not wheelchair, stroller friendly when you are trying to take the metro. Also, it's connected to the RTL buses terminus so it very convenient."
Nice view
"It's the best connection to the south shore, with plenty of parking lots and a variety of quick snacks and small shops. There's a laurentine Bank ATM as well as a Desjardins branch... You can even have your hair cut!"
Good place to go if you need to get to another place.
A subway / bus station into and out of the Montreal area. Safer and cleaner now than 20 years ago.  Does what it is supposed to.
"Usually, when you pay to use the metro,  once you arrive at the desired station, you have to pay an additional ticket to use the bus because it isn't the STM buses found at longueil. Make sure you bring extra fare for to and from, or you'll be stuck."
"If you've traveled to Montreal from the south, this is a convenient place to park and take the train into the city"
"Buses are late and sometimes arrive early, this is a problem that must be fixed"
"This small station is the far terminus of the yellow line and the main public transit connection between Montreal and the south shore. It is slung under the Place Charles-Lemoyne shopping mall, which also connects to the large new AMT Longueuil bus terminus. Once inside the badly-decorated mall, it is relatively difficult to find the access, as the signage is somewhat confusing (immediately above the stairs, it says ""Brasserie,"" not, say, ""M√©tro"" or the like). More importantly, the layout of the station doesn't show a lot of forward thinking. Unlike all the other terminus stations, arriving passengers do not pass through turnstiles when they disembark; accordingly, there is no way to get to the other platform without paying the fare again. (The turnstiles are at platform level and lead directly onto the Berri-UQAM line platform.)"
worst service ever got... I was going there to get a opus card but the women who served me tell me that my papers was not ok becuse the seal on it was not perfect... soo disapointed by a service for the population...
Just station
Useful restaurants and clear instructions for where the bus are.
Very good connecting point.
Its ait
OK
Bon terminus
Clean nice place
"Longueuil, same as Laval are in Zone 1 fares, monthly pass is at 135$."
Ok
"This is a review of the STM in general: Worst service ever, worst customer service ever, bus drivers feel all entitled with a lot of attitude problems. I hope the STM goes under or gets hit financially but I know it will never happen because the government will always bail them out. The amount of bad drivers is frightening and some of them don't even abide by the basic rules of public driving. It's a shame of a company. STM GFYG"
Riddled with crime from kids who go to Lauren Hill
Serious problem with hornets/wasps! Every time I come here they‚Äôre all over me!
"Good place for  chilling with friends in McDonald's, Tim, boustan, subway, PFK. Everything is near."
This station is really dirty and most of the escalators are shut down. There is allot of construction around the station right now. It is not practical. The bus drivers over there are always in a hurry. I miss the bus alot of the time. I do not recommend to get off at this station. ‚òπÔ∏è
"Miserable lady in front desk from 9hPM shift in the week. Very short hair with glasses, she always rude, negative and she look like she doesn't want to be there .. So unprofessional"
"A center station for West Islanders for many years, and have been using this station for a while. the staff is very helpful calm and professional. There are numerous buses, but, the 470 takes you all the way to the West Island at Fairview shopping Center and towards Pierrefonds. A north Hub for the island of Montreal one can say."
"In the last 25+ years that I've been using this station regularly, I've never had any major issues. Easy to get around, signs are clear and employees are helpful and kind. However, there have been quite a few changes in the past 10 years that changed the metro station for the worst. Most garbage cans have been removed (only 4 left, all of which are near the turnstiles, instead of being spread around. Past the turnstiles, you have to hold on to your trash I guess) and the buses arrive late way too often. Once, a bus arrived 45 min late (at rush hour, no less). By then, there were so many people that it filled up way too fast, so I didn't even bother getting on because I hate tight spaces."
"At least one of the escalators is always broken for some reason. Not the cleanest. 4 entrances, loads of bus stops around. There is a depanneur inside."
"Safer than it was 10 years ago, but still 4 stars because I was robbed there once at 13.( No one bugs me anymore at 6‚Äô3‚Äú and an adult."
Connectivity wise best location in Montreal.
The architectural design of this metro station is unique compared to some other metro stations. It‚Äôs my 2nd favorite metro station in the Montreal Metro system.
"This station will be closed for 3 or 4 weekends starting from this week, march 23, 24.
Also it will be closed in the summer for 11 weeks they said."
The stm drivers are all classless and terribly rude. I'm tired of riding on busses while the driver screams like an animal at its passengers while making racist remarks.
"People complain about this escalator not working or waiting times for buses. But the station is doing what it's supposed to be doing. It has an elevator for people with reduced mobility.
Are you gonna go to another station because of those problems? No. It's still doing what it's meant to be doing."
Why is there no washrooms at a terminus station. How can you have such a busy station without any public washrooms in the metro for the patrons? Toronto has it and even have wifi
"Bus terminus is poorly designed and overloaded during peak hours. Multiple bus lines stop in the same spot at almost the same time, leading to chaotic boardings. Queues commonly extend from one stop into the next one. One must make a large detour to reach the end of the terminal furthest away from the metro station. To prevent passengers from taking shortcuts, security guards are present almost full time to block the way - an absurd expense and a huge waste of money. Car traffic gridlocks the area at peak hours."
"The Platform Accesses are too small, since the station was never meant to be a Terminus. The Terminus of the orange line was supposed to be on Rue de Salaberry."
"The escalator has been out of order for over a year.
The south entrance smells so bad. Like dead animals.
One of the worst metros possibly."
Not too bad
When we go to apply job for my wife they say I call you. But they only one time  after she wait for call they call next 2 go  how you  fords family if they call 2 week after   Only for one day go working !!!!üò∂
All the time is a construction.  An escalator not work many times.
Everything is there
Fast  n  effecientüòÄ service
Escalators barely ever work... sketchy people and cleanliness is awful
Good.
What a dump and also no drop off location for passengers.
Good hub
The station is like any other. It does what it was made to do
Nice place
3/5
Elevator and the exscalators are frequently out of order
Fast efficient transit
Bus driver did not wait for me....I'm walking with a cane to catch the 470....trying to hobble for the 1436 bus....could not run...thought he could of stopped or waited....oh well
Very nice and clean metro!
Elevators and escalators are always broken
the escalators never work.
This station is plagued by a constant stream of escalator issues and repairs.
Gets me where I need to go
One of the upward escalators has been under repairs for over half a year
"Very crowded, with buses that have a tendency to come 20 minutes late."
Pretty Old School Architecture
Good station but a little too quiet
"This astonishing station's volume takes the shape of a gigantic irregular concrete space. Its most striking aspect is the immense triangular cavern and slope, expanding from the top of the escalators to the mezzanine, permitting passengers a birds'-eye view of the mezzanine and trainroom from up above.Repeating the slope's irregular geometry is the shape of the mezzanine, which bridges diagonally across the platforms. Similarly, the roof of the great volume is slanted down rather than orthogonal.
As for the single entrance building, it features rows of triangular windows. Their shape mirrors that of the Olympic Village towers which they show."
Metro station - nice place
Gorgeous
"Beaucoup d'escaliers, ce qui peut √™tre difficile pour les personnes en chaise roulante (ou peu en forme, si les escaliers roulants sont bris√©s)."
"We were visiting Montreal and since it was a last minute travel, I got hotel only in  Laval. I could easily drive and park free at Montmorency outdoor parking for full day then take Metro to downtown and after roaming around in Montreal, I take Metro back then drive to hotel from Montemorency. Clean and near station with escalators and lift. The station also has a huge indoor parking lot for 7.75$. I‚Äôd suggest using outdoor during weekends as it is easy to find parking spot and weekdays its full by 8am."
"I love this metro. Its just so nice. Lots of diversity here. Just a swell place to transport yourself underground or above ground by bus. Give yourself some self care, take a subway ride to montmorency.  Where dreams come true"
"My car was stolen on Monday  in montmorency parking lot i was coming back from a temporary job and couldnt find my car Be aware theres sneaky people around there without you even knowing they can be just sitting somewhere looking at you waiting for you to get in the metro and finds the right moment to steal your car.
I want to say thanks to the security for being very patient with me.
I may not get a feed back but its ok.

By the way the snow removal people look lazy! The parking lot and around the metro hasn't been done properly!"
The last metro stop ok the Orange line ro the north
"Travellers be warned, if you buy specific passes for your time in Montreal/Laval and plan to go back several times, be aware that there are certain versions of the passes not accepted at this station. The only place this is referenced is a single pillar in the station and on the website. Staff will not assist you or change your purchase if you've purchased something that does not work."
"Laval having a power trip because no one likes it there so the best they can do is lock you in their awful city and trick you into paying them to leave that forsaken place. I still don't understand why I can't just the same pass I used to get there to leave.stay away, don't worry you're not missing anything."
"Large, clean terminal."
"Great station, free parking if you're lucky, cheap inside parking, very clean Station, don't wait until the begining of the month to buy you pass here because the line can be very long"
Paint dries faster than a customer gets processed at the ticketing booth upstairs.
"Backpackers, put your bags down!!! Where are the metro inspectors  to enforce this basic civic rule? Twice already I got hit in the face w people‚Äôs backPacks.

No seating places, people pushed against each other, numerous delays of 3-10mns.
Departure time: 7:30am"
"My wife‚Äôs sister lives in St. Jerome. Problem #1 By ten AM ALL the station parking places are filled. So now you are driving around trying to find some place to park. We eventually parked in the university parking lot and paid $10.00. Tremendous loss of time and inconvenience ! Second problem: It is 18 miles from my sister in laws house. At 3 - 4 pm you arrive at the end of the line get into the 7 - 15 mph traffic (northbound) for the next 30 miles. So to cover the last 26 plus miles home, IT STILL TAKES 55 + additional minutes to get home. This is a great idea NOT yet perfected. June 13. 2019"
The fact that you cannot use an STM monthly pass here is simply unacceptable.
"Wanted to take a bus so bought a ticket, ticket was not working with that bus. So went to buy another ticket, but now my opus was full so needed to buy a physical one. They where OUT OF TICKET...  End up missing my bus and took a uber because of this Bs. Thank you Laval, that's why everybody hate you."
"I understand why the STM ticket system works, but its inconvenient for people who live in central Montreal."
"It's a great station. It's near the university of Montreal campus, also the Montmorency cegep and now also of the all new Place Bell. Home of the Rocket de Laval. You have a lot of parking but you need to pay, but if your lucky enough there's a few free spots around. The only bad thing is that it's an outdoor station  but when the weather's great it's nice."
Montmorency metro is good
"I always wait 45minutes for parking but while few cars are waiting for there turn to park , someone comes all of the sudden without waiting or staying in line goes in and takes our parking spots...
There should be some kind of rules so that everyone can wait in line first comes first gets the spot..
Its not fare ,one day I'm afraid people will fight in the parking cause I witnessed once..."
"Decent Metro, the localization could have been better but I guess because it is because College Montmorency it was made convenient for the students commuting."
"It all works how it should, not much to say about a terminal. Has free parking outside and payed indoor parking, the indoor parking is not too expensive."
"Indoor parking was really bad, there is no ""remaining free spots"" counter anywhere, so you just drive and drive to the last floor, then you have these weird valet  service. I dislike giving my keys to people or have people drive my car. Then the metro ticketing machines are so not user-friendly and slow, you anyways get a line up if you just need to buy a two way ticket. What year is this? 1990????!"
"It's a nice place. Heated space to wait for your bus with big panels that tell you when they arrive, bathrooms and a nice caf√© and dep to get some stuff while waiting."
The reason why I'm only giving 2/5 is because the restrooms are disgusting. I feel like they are not properly cleaned and disinfected. The other problem with this metro station is the fact the Employees don't give the right information when it comes to tickets purchases sometimes. You could end up trying to take a laval bus with tickets for montreal.
HORRIBLE!! I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF! i go to that lady to buy two tickets for laval bus and i TOLD HER 2 times! and i get it and left... i go to the bus and the driver said its montreal tickets so here i lost 6$ because when i came back to tell her you did a mistake and didnt tell me i had to go buy it upstairs.. and she scream at me and saying ' regarde moi dans les yeux jte dit que jai pas entendu so vazy donc en haut esti ' ... i go get the tickets upstairs and one lady said ' how can i help ' so i told her i wanna buy tickets and she said ' do you have an obus card? ' i said no i dont and she said okay stay in this line and i waited 20-25minutes and arriving to the lady she said we only sell tickets to does with a opus card and that i have to pay by cash at the driver guy... WHY THEY MAKE ME TURN IN CIRCLE AND FK WITH MY TIME AND MONEY ?? THEY DONT KNOW NOTHING!!!
Clean and last stop on the orange metro line north. Concerts held in the summer right by metro. French college Montmorency across the street as well as Maison des Arts de Laval.
Simply amazing to have a metro so close to a calm area and city .
You can be lost easy.  People are not helpful.
Best looking station in the entire subway
Nice clean and green
"Good metro, but impossible to find parking..."
Great service I am talking about the stl
One of the nicer metro station; large and clean.
I missed my bus to Toronto and Hamilton Travels took me to my Destination in Toronto.üòÅüòÄüòç
Stm needs to get their butts on taking this station from the stl
Is ok
Most organised terminus in laval
Horrible service......
Montmorency
"Take the metro every day, little far from where I live but clean"
Great place !
"No phone service inside, bus barely on time and toilets sucks"
Clean environment. Parking is a huge issue here.
This is the end of the orange line for now.
Solid metro station
Very well situated and cared for
"Good place, excellent coffee"
Not the best station
Toilets are smelly. Good in General
"Toilets check, coffee shop check, mini market check, what else do we need in a subway station,
Plus it's the main place to get Laval/Montreal tickets"
"People are rude, customers and staff."
If only the bus would come in time...
Its a metro station. Lot of parking on the weekends but don't try to find one during the week.
"New metro station,  connects to all buses"
Not clean.
It's a metro
Hard to find parking around here for the day.
Cool
Not wheelchair friendly. All metros should have this. Very shameful
"This station is built according to a symmetrical, functional, modernist plan. Two identical square entrance pavilions, kitty-cornered across an intersection, lead symmetrically into the rectangular ticket hall. The walls at platform and mezzanine level are covered with attractive dark grey rough concrete and trimmed in stainless steel. The walls over the platform vaults are decorated with triangular shapes. Two further accents at platform level are the monolithic forms of the feet of the staircase, and the looming presence of air vents above the Angrignon platform."
"√Ä very typical metro station, but there are many places to eat nearby."

On either side of the mezzanine in the tunnels leading to the kiosks are two abstract murals in bright colours, the one to the south predominantly yellow-orange, and the one to the north predominantly blue-green. The pieces are designed to be removed and shuffled around; originally, this was done every season, and miniature versions were made to assist in this. The murals are signed Jean Cartier."
i like it
"Convenient location, and bright as there are lots of windows for an underground subway station."
Pretty have a lot of car station lot of people tho
Great place to visit
"Angrignon park outside, terminus ease of busses and park to  enjoy."
It needs more regular cleaning.
"This subway station is pretty busy and has a great design which lets a lot of sunshine onto the platform. It is a shallow subway station, end of the green line and is part of a very busy bus terminal. Also one exit leads to the beautiful Parc Angrignon."
"Terminus is busy in the mornings. Often the machines for card purchases are not working. Just two of them are definitely not sufficient for the  number of people who go through the stop in the morning and need to buy tickets/cards.
Plenty of people also who distribute the free newspaper. Around 3 or 4 outside and one more inside. Sometimes you need to navigate around all just to get to the entrance."
"Nice, Bright station to catch the electric bus!"
"Pretty good metro station. Has a bus terminal, the metro station, park, parking lot within a 2 minute walk"
THIS STATION IS ONE OUT OF MANY BEAUTIFUL STATIONS IN THE STM NETWORK IT HAS A VERY GOOD AMOUNT OF NATURAL LIGHT TROUGH THE ROOF AND VERY BEAUTIFUL ART WORK.
"nice metro station, bus friendly and easy to find a parking"
I always loved this metro. There is my favorite restaurant there.
"Easy and ample parking, a nominal fee for the day, we met a very nice attendant who helped us with questions, this is the station to use if visiting Montreal and you want to avoid downtown parking."
Easy nice metro station with street parking or paid parking in lot.
Easy to find the bus stops right after you get off the station.
Lots of light.
Metro station with a pokemon gym.
last station on green line to the west.. pretty old..
So many Canadian Geese! :D
Best service
"Many bus routes, frequent even though some routes lack frequency"
Lacks escalators and elevators.
Great
"Underground coffee shops, convenience store. Customers service stand, north and south bus terminals with digital updates of the bus arrivals & departures. Coming soon wheelchair accessible with elevators from street level down to the trains. Best cinnamon buns, made fresh every day. Also many other tasty take away menu items. Agga coffee served here."
Clear map of where to get buses as there are a couple of them
They rejected to allow my bike with flat tires in Sunday afternoon. I had to lock the bike outside and come back to pick it up the next day. They could be a little bit understanding and flexible to encourage using public transport for the citizens.
Still under construction for the past 10 years lol waiting on renovation to see if it gets better. Got pushed by a homeless man. Almost started a random fight
"Reaching the 18 bus right as it leaves, at midnight, it's REAL fun to have it completely refuse to wait even one more second."
"Standard metro station, dollar store nearby so when you missed your bus in the summer you can go get water and stuff. Construction can be a bit annoying as it changes the layout and bus drop off, 141 is the bus to go to gallery d'Anjou. Shows up most often"
"As this station serves as the green line's eastern terminus and an important bus depot, it combines elegant modern design with efficiency. A row of entrances along rue Honor√©-Beaugrand converge into a large concourse. From there, huge monumental staircases backed with murals by Jean-Paul Mousseau lead to the platforms just beneath the mezzanine level. The platforms themselves expand outwards towards the staircases, as the ceilings rise and fall to break the monotony of the long floors. The platform walls are covered in a frieze of cement, whose slashlike forms express the dynamism of the transit system. Lights hidden behind the nameplates throw dramatic shadows onto the walls."
best metro station in lasalle
Coffee tastes bland
Metro green line Honor√©-Beaugrand
"Make this your stop if you're visiting the Montreal Olympic Park. The main attractions are closer to this station than the other station (Pie-IX). The station is pretty typical - clean, artsy, and modern, but lacking restrooms."
"Situated to the east of the Olympic complex, opposite metro Pie-IX, this station is plain and sober without being dull. The monumental (60m x 27m) pavilion is built directly over the platforms, accessible by two sets of stairs. The walls are mostly covered with rough dark grey concrete, textured with vertical ridges, a finish typical of the period used throughout the station. The area over each bench is emphasized by deep red vertical tiles in each groove. The mid-section of the shallow platforms, built in trench, is illuminated by a skylight."
"Clean station that is very convenient for the Biodome, cinema, and other attractions."
"Near surface metro station.

TV displaying when the next train will arrive."
"Sadly there is less and less stuff happening there as the baseball team is gone for good, the Biod√¥me has been closed since a while now and then the covid pandemic make it a deserted, very large ordinary subway station."
Great place .
"Great place to visit the Olympic stadium and the jardin botanique, specially for the kids"
"This is the main station for the Olympic Park, although I thought the next station (Viau) is actually situated closer to the main attractions of the park, such as the Observation Deck, Planetarium, and Biodome Science Museum. The sculpture of the Olympic rings on the station wall was really neat, as are the station's design and public art. Unfortunately, no restrooms."
"Very clean, easy access to Hochelaga and Vieux-Rosemont."
There are a lot of things to see
"his station, which is the main access point to the Olympic Stadium and other Olympic installations, emphasizes subtlety. The looming walls in earth tones and roughened, ridged concrete - a characteristic of the period - give an air of calm power that sets in relief the excitement that a spectator passing through the station will feel or has felt."
Beautiful scene
"Next to the olympic stadium, this place also has winter activities as well. Nice to get a little away from downtown and visit this eastern neighborhood"
This is so fast and yes very clean. People are greeting and so nice
Nice
good
Good job

"This is a winter review. ¬†For all winter activities like snowshoeing, tubing, cross-country skiing, skating, you can check the conditions on the website: lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act‚Ä¶It costs adults $20 for 2 hours of ski or snowshoe rental. ¬†They offer 3 sizes: S, M, L. ¬†You simply need to reserve online and pay upon pick up at the rental trailer close to the Pavillion. ¬†The snowshoe trail is loosely indicated and takes you all the way to the back of the Montreal General Hospital at the halfway point and circles back to Beaver Lake. ¬†It's got uphills and downhills so it's a good workout. ¬†Depending on the trail conditions, it can take as little as an hour or up to 2 hours to complete this trail. ¬†With the trail a bit compacted by earlier trekkers, the trail only took us 1.5 hour to complete. Parking availability isn't too bad in the winter as people are coming and going constantly so spaces free up periodically. ¬†That's because there's only so much snow activity that one can have in a day. ¬†I think it would be much more difficult to find parking in the summer when people want to stay longer. The parking wasn't cleared so the snow was pretty thick in the lot. ¬†Fun place to bring your own gear to trek across the snow, slide down the small slopes, your dog for a walk or skate on the refrigerated rink. ¬†The skating ring has the longest lines as they limit the number of people allowed on the ice. ¬†On a Saturday afternoon, there were probably a few dozen of people waiting in line for the skating rink."
"Parc du Royal has a character all on its own and it's the place to go if you're looking for an awesome Montr√©al scenery. It's like NYC's Central Park- except Parc du Royal has that high peak almost giving you that 360¬∞ panoramic view. Postcard-perfect views? Hell yeah. We've visited the park on our first Autumn Montr√©al trip a few years ago, then a few more times during the winter after that- and the landscape is just jaw-dropping and gets better every time. We've driven up, but this is the kind of park where you can seriously take it up several notches and work your quads on a hike or just a quiet stroll if you want. Parc du Royal brims with tons of loops, turns, entrances and exits. It's like the heart and soul of this area where it gives us a true taste of the park life."
"This park provides a fun amount of physical activity while hilking to the top, and a rewarding picturesque view from the top, of Downtown Montr√©al. I would definitely recommend this as a Must for tourists given that it is just a couple blocks from the Montreal museum of fine arts and McGill University. For those who are with someone not afraid to go to the top at dusk or at dawn I truly recommend hiking to the top near sunset it sunrise to get the perfect photo. I cannot really comment on anything besides the view from the look out as it is all I really saw while at the park. encore une fois en fran√ßaisCe parc offre une activit√© physique amusante tout en se hissant au sommet et une vue pittoresque enrichissante du haut du centre-ville de Montr√©al. Je recommanderais certainement cet endroit comme un must pour les touristes √©tant donn√© qu'il se trouve √† seulement quelques p√¢t√©s de maisons du mus√©e des beaux-arts de Montr√©al et de l'Universit√© McGill. Pour ceux qui sont avec quelqu'un qui n'a pas peur d'aller au sommet au cr√©puscule ou √† l'aube, je recommande vraiment de marcher jusqu'au sommet pr√®s du coucher du soleil au lever du soleil pour obtenir la photo parfaite. Je ne peux pas vraiment commenter autre chose que la vue depuis le belv√©d√®re car c'est tout ce que j'ai vraiment vu au parc."
"Parc du Mont-Royal or Mount Royal Park is like the Central Park of Montreal. Unlike several city parks, however, this one contains a mountain. It's a small mountain just west (only a couple blocks) of downtown Montreal. The city of Montreal got its name from Mount Royal. Pronounce it like ""Mont Royale"" and you'll see what I mean. Mont Royale, Montreal. The park is huge, covering almost 700 acres, and the mountain rises as high as 764 feet.We stayed in an Airbnb on the east side of the park, pretty much on McGill University campus, on Aylmer St. We walked from our Airbnb, past Percival Molson Memorial Stadium and McTavish Reservoir, and hiked to one of the high points on the mountain: Chalet du Mont-Royal (yelp.com/biz/chalet-du-m‚Ä¶). I highly recommend it. I'm not sure where else you can get such elevated and wide-sweeping views of the Montreal city skyline.From where we started, at Pine Ave W and Peel St, the hike took us less than 45 minutes and it was a leisurely hike. We took breaks to rest and take in views as well as took a detour to see the Mount Royal Cross. The Mount Royal Cross is in an opposite direction, but not far from, the chalet. The Mount Royal Cross isn't giant like Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. It's a simple 36-foot-tall see-through cross with light bulbs on it. If you're headed to the chalet, you might as well check it out. The founder of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve, placed the original cross on Mount Royal in 1643 to thank God and the Virgin Mary from sparing the colony from flooding.I think if you take a brisk, non-stop walk from where we started, you can reach the chalet in 20 minutes or less, certainly 30 minutes or less. We did encounter one nice city view on the way up and back down, between the chalet/cross and our starting point. The park, in general, was clean and not much differentiated it from other public parks in major cities. The trails were mostly dirt/gravel. There were benches throughout the park. On a Saturday evening around sunset, it was busy with a diverse mix of people -- locals, tourists, students, families, young, old, etc. You do have to climb a decent amount of stairs so I wouldn't recommend this hike for the elderly.On the way down, the trails lacked adequate lighting, so we used the lights on our phones to help us see."
"Really nice urban park with amazing views of the city. Must visit when in Montreal. We just walked there, wish I had my bike to bike around."
"Beautiful little park in the Montreal metropolitan area. This place is beautiful during the dark of winter as well as in the heart of summer. Watching the snow fall during the winter is so magical, almost like being in a snowglobe - here in the summer, there's usually pianos set up for people to play music, people strolling about enjoying the weather, and a gorgeous view of the city from the top."
"We did not come to Montreal prepared to climb a mountain, so when the kids suggested we do so on our recent vacation, we had to take our city-clothed not-too-young selves up that mountain. ¬†Note: There are two possible ways up that we discovered. ¬†(I'm sure there are a million more). ¬†One is to wind your way up wood-side where you run into a cafe that has swings and tables a third of the way up. ¬†The other way is to take stairs all the way up. ¬†We were glad we took the woodsy approach, although I must confess I was a bit concerned to discover that we still had two thirds of a mountain to go when we reached that cafe. ¬†The view was already gorgeous. I could have been perfectly content at that point, but by golly up to the top we had to go! I DID it. ¬†This old gal might have been slower than the other three, but I huffed and puffed it up and made it back down those gazillion stairs. ¬†So however you make it to the top (lots and lots of folks took vehicles, do know there is a bathroom inside a small cafe (down yet more stairs), where you will also see a teeny museum that will let you know it's not really a mountain, but a mere remnant of something that I can't remember, because my brain couldn't fathom that I had climbed anything less than a MOUNTAIN. ¬†NOTE: ¬†we weren't the only people who got lost trying to figure out how to come down. ¬†There was a detour sign that appeared to go up instead of down. ¬†After trusting our instincts (WRONG), we had to turn around and go back to that detour sign and actually follow it, which led us to those stairs that most others were using to go up and down anyway. ¬†Killer stairs. ¬†Lots of them. ¬†We were glad to be going DOWN. ¬†Overall it was a very enjoyable hike with a sense of accomplishment for this Gal who is not known for her outdoorsy ways."
"Mount Royal Park is beautiful and worth a visit, whether you're coming in the summer or winter to visit Montreal. It's a beautiful park with many ¬†trails with vantage points at the top overlooking the entire city. In the winter, there are opportunities to snow shoe though the trails and both winter & summer offer opportunities for a beautiful overlook of downtown Montreal.So how do you get to the overlook? In my instance, daylight was running out and I simply Ubered to the Chalet and then walked down from there. You can do this, find a trail to walk to the top or take the stairs directly up. Either way - definitely carve out some time to explore this park when you're in Montreal! You won't regret it!"
"Tranquility, peace ¬†go for a walk here you won't regret it. There's a lake a mountain ¬†beautiful"
"Beautiful view of the city. However super ¬†busy. If you don't like crowds, well... have fun. The view is definitely worth it but you have to push your way in to find a spot to take photos. If you're a photographer, bring a zoom lens!!!The path up is a decent hike on a nice day! ¬†There's an overpriced cafe at the top for you to refuel, and some bathrooms.."
"Just essential big huge green space in these crazy times. The air, the wide open spaces, they're just what we all need right now. The most fun bike ride you can do is to do the work all the way up to the top and then enjoy coasting (flying) down the wide paved trails that wind from top to bottom. This wild fun relieves some of the stress built up right now, especially when you do it at dusk and shoot out into the cool evening streets of Montreal."
"Parc du Mont Royal is a must when you visit Montreal. If you want a (free) view of the city, this is the place to see it. It's about a 20-minute hike up many, many stairs but it's not terrible. It's doable. Just make sure you go on a cooler day, and you have plenty of water at hand. They have other, longer trails, but we didn't have the time or energy to do those. We drove to the park, and were able to find (paid) street parking nearby pretty easily.I saw in some of the other reviews that it's a great nighttime view, so if I ever return to Montreal, I'll give that a shot!"
This afternoon I walked to and climbed up to the top of Mount Royal (I've done it a few times in the past).The stairs are at the top of Peel Avenue. ¬†It's not an easy climb up! ¬†There is some repair going on so I had to detour along a path. The view of the city are worth the climb!Heading down was a lot easier than going up!
"At Mont-Royal, you can enjoy the four season to their fullest!Specially autumn! Magic of colours will take your breath away!"
"One of the true gems of the city, Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park) is a must visit for any first timer to Montreal or someone looking to get a great view of the city. A large series of hills created as a result of a volcanic eruption hundreds of years ago, this area has become a symbol of the city and a mountainous landmark defined by its history.There are a number of ways to navigating through this magical place. First, one can hike / walk / climb their way to the top. It will take time and is a good group sweat-together activity. The leisurely, scenic route is through the woods where there are various group friendly sites along the way. There are a number of other trails, but those take even longer. Going up through the stairs is the more direct route and is a great way to enjoy the view, but remember there will almost always be people behind who will have to go at your pace. Bring a little water and some nice shoes.Then there is the bus. For a handful of dollars ($10?), one can ride the bus from downtown Montreal (#11 or #711) all the way to the top in very little time. This is particularly handy for those who are in a slight rush and is the preferred option for most tourists. There are a number of sites throughout the mountain, but the Chalet is the one that most folks are gunning for. It has an incredible view; the picturesque one that is on virtually every postcard. On top of that there is a cafe with food / drink, bathrooms, and a place for souvenirs. Good weather months are clearly the time to go, though I'm told winter time there are a lot of fun activities happening all around the mountain. Tourists are going to be in full force, which means photos / selfies without someone in them might be a challenge."
"A absolutely beautiful place to people watch and see the views. You need to be in pretty good shape for the hike, lots of steps. There are bathroom facilities when you reach the top and a restaurant, just snacks. There is also a water fountain to refill your water bottle. A nice morning adventure."
"I'm so ashamed of myself. ¬†My friends and I tried to walk to the top of the hill but we gave up and called an Uber..LoL I blame the heavy brunch we had minutes before visiting that made us sluggish. I thought it was pretty cool that the park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the person who also designed New York's Central Park. We came mid-day on a Saturday and it was filled with other tourists, joggers, picnickers, dog walkers and bicyclists. We stayed at the overlook for awhile and took pictures of one another before venturing off down the walking path. I really appreciate quiet moments with nature in the heart of the city. If I lived in Montr√©al this would definitely be a place I'd come to recharge. Not on a weekend of course. It's way too crowded with tourists. Maybe at sunrise. I'm sure that would be beautiful."
"Our day in this park was a picture perfect Spring day. It seemed that all the students from the nearby universities were there sunning themselves trying to catch some rays after a long harsh Canadian Winter. The sun beams warmed our backs as we strolled through the numerous pathways that the park offers. We enjoyed listening to the native children speak French and tried to understand what they were saying with our limited command of the language. I actually did better reading signs...like where to pay for park parking which was very reasonable.The walk around the lake was very picturesque. There are also a few museums in the park. You can get information on that at the Visitor's Center near the parking area.Once we left the park, we found a viewing area where you can see the whole city of Montreal. It was a great place to take pictures!"
"Since it was a humid day, we took the bus (i.e. Bus# 11) to get to Mount Royal. We found that there's two areas where you can see the view of Montreal.1) Bus stop ""Belvedere Camillen-Houde"": This would be the Mount Royal Lookout and you'll mostly see trees and some of the buildings. 2) Bus stop ""Remembrance / Chemine du Chalet"": This would be Mount Royal Chalet area. This is the place to be and you'll see the NICE view of Montreal. The chalet has restrooms, a cafe, and a small gift shop too.We also hiked a trail to see the Mount Royal Cross. It was a bit difficult to find even though I used Google Maps to navigate. I wished there were more signs along the trail tho.Overall, I could come back to Mount Royal if I visit Montreal during fall season just to see the foliage. I'm sure the view be a lot prettier with colorful leaves."
"The mountain is a must see when in Montreal. Think of it like a Central Park up the mountain. A few stairs up from the street level to get to the trail walkway. The walkway is a gradual slope or you can take the stairs that cuts through parts for a short cut. There are also small narrow paths through the trees, this is quite steep and you need to watch your steps a bit. Some people say the walk up the mountain is 30-45 minutes, which I don't understand. We spent almost four hours walking up, walking around at the top and then down.When you walk up, the first building you reach is Maison Smith which has a free exhibition, a cafe that serves sandwiches, quiche and such. Public access to the restrooms downstairs. There was no Wi-Fi to connect to. Legs were killing and an uber ride back down would have been nice lol. There is a very nice lake area just next to Madison Smith. Then you can keep walking up and shortly after reach the Mont Royal Chalet, where you can get great views and photo opportunities of the city skyline and gaze across the river and mountains. The chalet looks a bit like an old style train station hall inside, again here there is a cafe that serves coffee and cakes. The restrooms are downstairs under ground. There is a walkway that takes you in a loop around the mountain top. I wish there were more walkway options that take you down to different parts of the city without having to cut through the very steep and hard to follow paths. Also wish the signs would show distances between each part of the mountain better. At the top there is a cross, Eiffel tower style, obviously a lot smaller, something to do with the founders of the city, although I believe they didn't reach the top, rather just the plateau. I would recommend skipping the cross unless you do the full loop around where you will see it anyway. It looks like a construction element rather than a commemorative cross. They could have done something more graceful with this one. If you happen to go up in one of the high rise building in downtown, you can see the cross at the top. There are a lot of local joggers making their way from the bottom to the top."
"Took the steps aaaaaaaaall the way up. That is a mission and a half, especially after first climbing the giant straight up street before the mountainside. #BePrepared #Hydrate #HydrateAgainBut once you're up...It's quite lovely at the top. Views are nice. Lots of little ""dicky dee"" ice cream and drink people in the main areas. Had a Art Pop in pina colda flavour the Friends of Mont Royal stand. However, dont suggest the lime coconut flavoured one. We all agreed it wasn't great.Chanced a 2nd visit a couple months after my first ever visit. Stairs up was way easier when properly hydrated! Take a look inside the building at the top! The cafe is totally worth a stop. It's at the opposite side of the building from the view. Their pastries and coffee are excellent. The date square definitely hit the spot!Once you head out on the paths, it's super easy to take a wrong turn though. Have a map."
"Parc du Mont-Royal is like Central Park in Manhattan but has more of a true forest sanctuary vibe.There's so many great trails to walk and see animals hanging out in the foliage. Numerous picturesque views of the city as well. It's a little slice of natural paradise in a big city.Of course, no visit is complete without the required photo op at the top with the Montreal skyline in the background. Parking is reasonable: $3/hour but only $10/24 hours max. Personally, we like to drive up and then walk down into town and eat out way through the city, then burn it all off by trekking our way back, all uphill.It's a favorite locale to visit when in Montreal and well worth it."
"This was an excellent experience during our visit to Montreal. We were staying in a downtown hotel hotel so just check up Rue Peel to the main entrance to the never-ending stairwell up to the top view. ¬†It was a sunny blue sky day so the walk up, the breezes through the trees, and the subsequent view from the top was absolutely amazing. Remember to take bottled water with you to remain hydrated. At the top, the atmosphere was nice and as is the case with many of the parks, there is a piano player at the top creating a really nice atmosphere and ambience. We traversed the 339 steps to the top where we went to the Kondiaronk lookout as well as the Mount Royal Chalet. If you're not up for the stairwell up to the top, consider the bike pathway to the top which I'm sure is much easier. ¬†A truly memorable experience and great way to get some of that fresh Montreal air!"
"Seeing the photos of sweeping views of Montreal from Mont Royal I knew I had to make the climb during my visit. I had an uber drop me off in front of Maison Smith which is pretty much where the path starts to walk up. Its a very big park with lots of parking and many lookout spots. The day I visited Mont Royal was the first really nice day Montreal has had in awhile. It has been a long winter and you could tell how happy people were to finally get some sunshine and be in temps greater than zero. That being said there were lots of people enjoying the outdoors. Tons of folks were hiking the paths with families and dogs.¬† It really isn't a far climb to the main lookout spot. Approx 10 mins at an average pace. You get amazing views of the city and great photos here. There is a lodge with a cafe, gift shop, bathrooms. There are many paths that venture from the main one for hikers to explore. The main path also continues further to reach the cross (croix du mont royal). A must do in Montreal!"
Since my boyfriend lives across the street i don't enjoy the park as much as I should I see it every day but when I do snap back in to reality I realize there's so much to do. Winter time doesn't stop a soul from having fun the park was packed yesturday. Everyone was skiing and snow shoeing even crazy carpet teens it was so much fun ! You could spend hours just getting lost in the snow there. What a park! There's look outs and then there's secret little look outs but be careful it's slippery in the winter.
"Great park, great view. ¬†A must if visiting montreal. Great in the winter time too, lots of activities in the park (skiing, ice rink, tubing)."
"We took a hike from our hotel to the top of Mount Royal. It's quite a climb, but so worth it.What an incredibly breathtaking view from the top!!! I was stunned, what a lovely city!To make it even more magical, there's a beat up old piano at the top (chained to a light pole) and a wonderfully talented young man sat down and performed a few beautiful songs for everyone. He did a great job considering the piano was in less that ""show"" condition. There's ice cream carts, water fountains, a tiny gift shop, vending machines and plenty of washrooms available. What a great day!"
"Beautiful views overlooking Montreal. Too bad I wasn't here during Autumn as the leaves turning color would make the viewing all the more epic.Driving here is easy and there is a paid parking lot close to the summit. I wanted to walk the trail leading up to the summit, but I was overruled by my family. You would think they were scaling Mount Kilimanjaro!The view at the summit is breathtakingly ¬†beautiful. ¬†As corny as it sounds I felt a sense of calm and peace just soaking up the view. The summit has an outdoor piano if you are so inclined to play. The chalet at the summit has a gift shop and restroom. I would love to return in Autumn just to experience the beautiful changing foliage."
"Be sure to put in the address to the parking lot and not just ""Mont Royal"" in the GPS because you will have a hard time finding this! I pretty much went around Mont Royal to find parking. They have a lot of parking and you do have to pay. We walked 5 minutes to the Circle Stone and was amazed by how spacious it was. I did not expect it to be paved. The views were breathtaking and you are able to see Montreal very clearly. I think it helps that it was not too high up. I am not sure if I will come here for the hike but it was nice to make a pit stop here."
"Best place to view the whole Montreal! If you want the best view, we recommend taking the trail up the hill after dark. You can see the beautiful lights. It's Breathtaking!"
"If you're looking for a spot to get the most perfect, picture-worthy view of Montreal, this is the place for you!It took my friends and I about 40 minutes to hike up the hill and make it to the top (with a couple stops along the way to take in the scenery). It was pretty steep (which was not ideal at times since I'm afraid of heights!), but the breathtaking view was totally worth it! Once I made it to the top, I was so happy with myself! :)There was a stop about halfway up the hill to purchase water bottles and ice pops at a fairly reasonable price. My suggestion is to still bring your own water bottle along though. I wish I had brought one to keep myself hydrated the whole way!Not in for the full hike? No worries! You can drive part of the way up so that's an option!Whatever you decide, Parc du Mont-Royal is definitely worth your time! It was, without a doubt, my favorite part of my trip to Montreal!"
"I was so glad that I read some comments about how to enjoy this park before I went! ¬†Just like some mentioned , we took Uber to the top of the hill and hiked it down. ¬†The day we went there had quite snow up there (even though we didn't have any in downtown) and it was so slippery and hard to walk. ¬†The view from here was so gorgeous and hiking down the hill was slippery and hard but fun. ¬†I would love to go back again when it's warmer.."
Amazing park!We only were able to do one beautiful hike through the park to the chateau. ¬†Access to the park is well marked. ¬†The trails are easily followed with places to stop and enjoy. ¬† The trails are almost all paved. ¬†The chateau also has bathrooms. ¬†I would recommend bringing some water as well.
"A glorious and, by its name, hilly public park in the middle of the city, the Parc du Mont-Royal offers a nice, green respite from things and, perhaps most popularly, great views of the whole area.If you stick to viewpoints along the main drive, you will get nice, panoramic views of the Montr√©al skyline and the whole region. The key overlook that provides you with the ""money shot"" of the downtown skyline directly beneath you, however, is a short walk off the main drive behind the chalet.Currently, there is a tremendous amount of construction along park roads, so traffic going in and out (even buses) can be severely delayed. So, skip the exhaust fumes and make a nice, hilly hike out of it."
I think this is the central park of Montreal. We took the 11 bus to get here and we walked around taking the nice weather and view and the lookout point. it was packed on the weekend when we went. i would not recommend driving here. I would maybe walk up to park if I had a hefty breakfast or a normal breakfast for my standards. There are restroom downstairs the visitor center. The water fountain works and spits out CLEAN crisp clear water.Needs a korean taco trunk near the bus spot. Then this park gets a fifth star.
"Clean and very nice to come walk, exercise, enjoying time with friends and family in beautiful weather!"
"Beautiful view of Montreal. Short little walk to the cross. Warm yourself inside with some free WIFI and restrooms. Paid parking lot not too far from the viewpoint. Keep going pass the initial viewpoint on the left side of the hill. A lot of people brought their sleds, cardboard boxes and skis. Boy I wish I had something to slide on but my snow pants will do."
This is truly the best part of Montreal for me! ¬†So much greenery and nature and hiking in a big city is almost unheard of and Parc Du Mont-Royal really delivers. ¬†You literally feel transported to another place and we loved the peace and tranquility that it offers. ¬†My favorite part is the chalet and there are many paths to reach it including those infamous stairs. ¬†We ended up having Uber drop us off at a different lookout point towards the bottom of the park and walked about 45 minutes to reach the destination. ¬†That path is easy and relaxing so if you are with kids or the out of shape friends or the elderly or people wearing sandals (me) then I would suggest taking that route.
"Beautiful park, very open and spread out. If you are a serious walker then you can cover a lot of ground. If not, I'd suggest driving and parking around the various stops the park. We stopped at the Smith Maison and the Summit.Something I learned is that the Summit is where the overlook is. The overlook is the highest point in Montreal with the best views. There seemed to be some confusion on what spot this was on TripAdvisor so, to be clear, it's the SUMMIT. There is a pretty decent stair climb to get to the top. We got a bit turned around because of the different signs we tried to follow and wandered through some pretty slippery / muddy trails. Had to be extra careful. Not for the faint of heart. When you reach the top it's a beautiful open air almost amphitheater like area. There were street performers and people selling (slightly overpriced) ice pops. The environment is fun and people are sitting around, relaxing, and enjoying the sun.Tip: there are bathrooms located in the large building up the steps.To me, it was well worth the hike. (See photos)."
"This is a MUST DO if in Montreal! It is a bit of a hike to get to the top, so you need to be reasonably fit to do it but the view from the top is breathtaking and everyone there is taking selfies and in a good mood after there ascent to the top! Make sure you visit here, you will not be disappointed!!!"
"If you want an amazing view of the Montreal skyline, this is the place to be! The hike isn't easy but the view is completely worth it. Hiking up the hill through the park takes about 30-45 mins. Bring water & sunscreen with you just in case.This is a chill place to watch the sunset. Plus it's not overly crowded either!"
"We three sisters enjoyed our climb up through and almost to the top of Mount Royal (Parc du Mont-Royal) Park (there is a cross on the true top of it, a bit higher up than the welcome center). We chose the stairs which are very well maintained, not overly strenuous, but, if you need a break there a few landings on which to do so. Try early morning to avoid the crowds. The view from the promenade at the ""top"" are of Downtown, and other parts of the city, as well as the St. Lawrence River off to the left. Make sure to stop in at the beautifully restored chalet-like visitor center; not only does it have activities for kids (telescope, coloring pages, etc.), but stuff to keep us adults entertained and educated also. And bathrooms. And a cafe. And a gift shop.The ceilings and woodwork are beautiful. Not sure if the story I was told was correct, but I heard that these were former Canadian Mounties barracks. Pretty nice digs. You can take the stairs back down, or one of the many, winding and shaded paths."
"At the top of this city-park mountain you can breath in fresh air! There's several trails starting at various points on the big hill, and meander down to the street level. We visited this park in the late afternoon on a Wednesday and it was quite populated. Both locals out for a walk and tourists walking around searching for that perfect picture. Awesome panoramic views of Montreal! What looks to be the most popular lookout gave a 180 degree picture of downtown montreal and many of the ethnic neighborhoods around the city. The Observatory Lookout gives a different scope of the island, including their Olympic stadium, which is now used for sporting events, concerts, etc. it's open to the public, which I think is awesome that it's not just another defunct Olympic structure that once was, and now is nothing (Beijing!). I liked the Chalet building near the summit of the mountain. The stone on the outside. Gorgeous high wood beams lining the entire open hall, on the inside. There's a gift shop inside that has Shirts, postcards, pictures, and trinkets. Also, at the other end of the open hall is a guest services desk that has cool FREE males of the islands!!"
"O.M.G! This was absolutely a phenomenal hike and view. The trails oh the trails! So many trails paved, rocks, and dirt to indulge your every nature desire. Wildlife surrounds you and you become calm and one with the beautiful city. The people are so kind as they take in the moment of the view with you. This place is the answer for world peace. The cherry on top is the sprinkle of ice cream trucks on the observatory. This is a must."
"Amazing park in the middle of the city. Walked around the trails and made it to the lake. Very pleasant and easy stroll on a combination of paved and crushed gravel paths. Took the road back to an overlook of the city after dark. Great views!! There were a few groups of uni kids hanging around drinking beer and smoking pot; although they didn't bother us, it might be a concern for some. Signs all over saying to not feed the raccoons, yet everyone was. They're pretty used to humans because of that, but it would be nice if people just let them be wild."
"Such a lovely walk! It may be chilly, but you can warm up by the fire at the open chalet. The snow covered landscape was like no other!"
"Beautiful park and very nice walk to the top. There are even parts that you can bike to the top! It's got a bunch of ways to get to the top and if you are feeling tired, you can grab the bus and take it up.I liked that the building at the top of the mountain had a water fountain and gift shop. It had AC which was great and a nice escape from the heat.I would recommend walking it earlier in the morning since when we got there at noon, it was filled with tourists. All my videos had the background noise of the tourists talking or tourists in the view. If you love dogs, people walk their dogs along the trail, too. Montreal has some cute dogs!It's an awesome view of Montreal. Definitely worth the hike if you are in Montreal."
"This place is awesome. The best view of Montreal in the whole city. There is a little walk to it, but its not bad. Its a very clean park, and well taken care of. There is a piano up there that everyone can play, which is pretty cool! The views are absolutely amazing. You can even see the start of the Adirondack mountains from up there. If your in Montreal, this is a definite place you need to see."
Awesome view of Montreal from atop. There's two ways to get to this viewpoint. One is to park ¬†on Pins Avenue and hike up about ten flights of stairs (it took us about 20 minutes). It's a great work out and the view will literally be breathtaking. The other way is to park at the lot near the top and walk less than ten minutes to the viewpoint. I've done both and I would recommend the stairs if you want a good workout and recommend the closer parking lot of the less physically fit people.They have a restaurant of some sort at the top for you to buy refreshments if you get hungry. Nice place to catch the sunrise!
"The Mont-Royal Park in Montreal is the quintessential spot to see the city. It is a great starting point for any trip to the beautiful city, and gives you a sense of the expanse of the metropolis. It is great any time of year, even in the sweltering heat of mid-summer. Bring some water, and take note of parking spots, as you don't have to force elderly members of your party to hike far if you know where to park. It's a beautiful area, and very popular, without feeling overly crowded. The main point of interest is definitely the lookout point over the city, but there are plenty of trails, green grass, and even a reservoir to explore. It's the perfect spot for a mid morning walk, an afternoon saunter, or for a great view of the sunset."
"How could I have forgotten to review such a memorable place?!This was one of the first places my husband (fianc√© at the time) took me to in Montreal. I was still very new to the city and so I guess it was a romantic spot to bring me to. Since then, we visit quite frequently and especially come to watch the sunset over a picturesque Montreal skyline! We always go to the peak where everyone is just taking pictures or chilling, enjoying the fresh air from up above! It is so peaceful and beautiful with chairs in front of the stunning Chalet where you can kick back and relax and admire the views.Definitely a very romantic and quiet spot to bring your significant other. Highly highly recommend :)"
"The park was nice to visit. Really beautiful and serene. We saw online that you could rent boats but when we got there the little lake on the map was really a pond. Kind of too small to rent a boat. Anyway it was nice to visit, we would come back!"
"The hike up to the Chalet of Mount Royal is a sweaty workout but definitely manageable. ¬†The view is worth the sweat and tears! ¬†The photos do not do it justice since they lack the spatial element. ¬†There is so much open space and sky up at the Chalet. My friend and I took the most direct path up Peele Street from McGill's campus. ¬†We walked on gravel and climbed up a lot of wooden steps. ¬†There was more climbing than walking so we didn't find wearing flats to be a large issue but the small pebbles do get annoying. ¬† 99% of the people wear sneakers/athletic shoes so I recommend bringing an extra pair of shoes if you can. ¬†At one point, there was a continuous staircase of 256 steps, which was the final set before arriving at a flat surface near the Chalet. ¬†It was an intense 15-minute climb in total!From the Chalet, most people walk to the famous Cross. ¬†We headed to bus #11 instead, which took us down to Le Plateau neighborhood. ¬†It's a charming area with a lot of colorful houses, their winding staircases to the second level (French architecture?), murals, coffee shops, boutiques, and the famous Schwartz's Deli for smoked meat (pastrami)."
Amazing views of Montreal downtown. Wish we had got a good place to park. Had to walk a 10 min uphill but was totally worth it. I would recommend this place for both daytime and nighttime views!!
"I visited Mont Royal on my second day in Montreal and fell in love. We first walked up to the view point with the Chalet. For me the walk up was more picturesque then the view of the city. I guess I wanted to get away from the tall buildings that I see in Miami.After I walked over the Beaver Lodge (I think its called) to go snow tubing. There wasn't enough snow to ski but this was so much fun! It was 9 Canadian dollars a person to use a tube the entire day. And if you had your own sled you could spend the day there for free I think. This was such a great experience, and tubing was pretty exhilarating. Don't go to Montreal without stopping here!"
"Mount Royal Park sits on the hills of Mount Royal. It is popular with tourists and locals. It is just lovely. If you are anywhere in the area, it is a must see.Parking is easy and you can hike to the top of the summit if you want. The best views of the City are from the top of the park. It is amazing. It is a tad more crowded during the summer with many a local having a picnic lunch and hikers making the short trek to the top. It is never over crowded though and the locals are so friendly.On top of the great park and the views they have a restaurant with a view on Beaver Lake. The food is quite good and families are welcome."
"A nice big park in Montreal. This is the biggest and most famous park in the city. I wish I had more time to walk around here.Amy T. and I came on our last day before flying home. We Ubered up the hill to the cafe. On the way up, we saw a lot of people walking, running and biking up. If we were to come back here, I'd definitely try trekking up the hill.When we arrived at the cafe, we noticed many, many people. I mean, this place was packed! There were families, couples and people just walking and jogging all over the place. There are a few main trails to take, so we took the one up to the chalet. It was a short .5mi hike up and only took us about 10 minutes from the cafe. The view from the chalet is just gorgeous. You can see so much of Montreal. If we were to go back, I'd definitely want to check out the other trails, especially the one that leads to the cross!Overall, a great park with tons of trails, space and people. One of the must go places in Montreal if you love exploring!"
"Definitely visit this park! It's a beautiful view. Caution, if you go in March like I did, bring cleats for the ice. The observation area at the chateau was like a uneven ice rink. The walking paths were similar."
"A co-worker, upon hearing that we were going to be in Montreal for a few days, suggested to me that I do ¬†my long run up Mont Royal. Now, when he said ""up Mont Royal"", he neglected to mention that there are two versions of ""up"". He knows me - knows that I always take the stairs. Plus, he's a super smart guy - you'd think that that one tidbit of knowledge about me - stairs taker! - would have clicked into a thought along the lines of, ""She'll probably take the steps up Mont Royal, too...""I had this wonderful plan, which I proposed to my husband on our last full day in Montreal: we'd walk from our hotel (which was on the Rue Saint-Denis) to Mont Royal, spend a bit of time there, throw in a quick run, and then walk from there to La Banquise for a lunch of poutine. He was hesitant, but finally acquiesced. I can be quite convincing.So it was that we left our hotel - me dressed and ready to run, him in his normal clothes and running shoes. It was hot and steamy that morning, and we had nothing to drink on us. The only things I brought were our camera, my sunglasses and a bottle of sunblock. Yes, I can be quite crazy sometimes, too.The walk to the Mont was beautiful, as we passed right by McGill University. The grounds are gorgeous, and everything was so lush and green. We didn't have much time to stop and linger, as it was starting to get even hotter as we walked, and we shared the very real fear that the heat would do me in.We climbed on deceptively steep hill, passing faculty housing, in order to get to the base of Mont Royal. By the time we got to the top, I was sweating profusely and we were both sucking wind. Not willing to give in, we paused at the top (to take pictures, of course!) before we rounded one small bend and tackled the first set of stairs in front of us.I was full of energy and excitement at that point, so I ran up the first flight of steps. Nothin' doin'! My husband caught up to me, warning me to take it easy. I scoffed at him, and turned to tackle the next flight of stairs. Still a piece of cake! I got to the top of that flight, and saw a small incline ahead of me, which I subsequently conquered in record time. It was at that point that I started to feel a bit of the burn. I wasn't about to admit it to my husband, though, as he was still admonishing me for being reckless.Scoffing with much less vigor, I turned around and noticed that in order to get to the next set of stairs, we had to cross a path. I further noticed that people were walking across the path in both directions. Being the dummy that I am, I didn't stop to think what that could possibly mean. No, I was too focused on the next set of stairs to contemplate paths and their eventual meaning!The next flight of stairs...well. They beat me. I'm not too proud to admit it! We had to stop halfway up - for more pictures. It was beautiful up there, but not very restful, as all we heard were the others hiking up the stairs: feet pounding, breath coming in ragged puffs.The final set of stairs were just flat-out rude, but we'd gotten that far, and by this time, it was my hubs who was bound and determined to get to the top. We made it - barely - all the while loudly praying to the hydration gods that there'd be a vendor or a fountain at the top. And do you know, once you best that last flight of steps, you have to climb up a rather steep incline before you get to the terrace?But, the TERRACE! What a view! It's SO worth it (even if you're sticky, sweaty and splotchy, like I was). And yes, they had a glorious drinks vendor, who quickly passed over a couple bottles of Gatorade (bless her).The view, as I mentioned, is breathtaking. You've got a panoramic view of the city in front of you, and the (mostly empty) chalet behind you. There's a small store inside, plus some tables and chairs, and an all-important restroom area.Leaving the terrace and the view behind, if you follow the path out the opposite way, you get to the rest of the park, which we were told was designed by the same guy who helped design Central Park in New York. It's very lush and green, with lots of trails and wildlife (the squirrels are super bold, and we saw one beautiful owl).I left my husband sitting on a bench to do a quick run, and about a mile and half around the mountain, I realized I recognized where I was. I briefly thought I had come full-circle, and that my husband would be around the next bend, but NOPE! I'd run a path that took me back to the last flight of steps! I was staring up at the stairs that nearly broke me, and every fiber in my being was rebelling against the thought of going back up those wooden stairs. So, I turned around and ran right back the way I came from.The trails are well-maintained, and very scenic. They're also well-traveled, so there was always someone for me to wave at or throw a pained smile to (did I mention it was hot and humid that day?)Definitely worth the effort, no matter which way you go!"
"Fantastic park to take a nice long walk, even in the winter. ¬†The path to the stairs is quite long, and so is the staircase. ¬†But the view at the top makes it all worth it. ¬†It's paved with all the snow and has gravel on it but slipping can still be a possibility, so either be careful or get the appropriate shoes to be the most safe. ¬†Definitely recommended for any outdoor lovers visiting Montreal."
"Confusing but fun park! My boyfriend and I got veryyy lost trekking around, but there are so many trails (mini and long) that connect to each other so it's easy to re-route if necessary. We eventually made it to the top lookout point which was very nice. The park is a good mix of being out in nature but then a scenic view of the skyline and city."
"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. This park is iconic, it's glorious, it's beautiful, I could go on and on and on.I've hike up the mountain, I've biked, I've watched the sunset, I've had countless picnics and read under the sun for hours.This place will always be special to me. It's where I had my first kiss!"
"As a California boy relocating to Montreal, one thing I really missed was the outdoor life: hiking, trees, mountains, nature. And because I have been without car since I've moved here, the only types of nature I can go to have to be public transpo accessible. Enter the lovely Mont Royal, Montreal's Central Park. I've done all kinds of things here. Drove to the viewpoint that overlooks the northern (or is it western?) part of the city. Did the New Years 5k run in the snow. Biked through the cemetery past Beaver Lake up to Mont Royal Chalet. My go-to activity is to get off at Peel Metro, walk up Peel to the base of the mountain and take the stairs up to the Mont Royal Chalet. After resting and enjoying the view, I go back down about halfway and cut a left towards the Rachel Street entrance of the park, hike through some forest, and end up at Jean Mance Park. On a sunny Sunday I might catch the Tam Tam drummers. From there I get on Av du Mont-Royal, picking up a Kouign Amann or a quick espresso from Kahwa Cafe, then catching the Metro back home. A perfect, active afternoon (or morning!). Not looking forward to the snow, but perhaps it will give me more to discover about this lovely mountain."
"Our first time to visit beautiful Parc Du Mont Royal during freezing winter season and what a sight to behold! We weren't sure what to expect! We started our hike at the bottom of the hill, and made the trek high up the very long and what seemed like endless stairs, to a woodsy and picturesque snowy trail path. It was a slow climb up the hill but once we reached the top, a beautiful Chalet with sweeping views of downtown Montr√©al awaits us. Please be warned! Except for the stairs, the snowy trail path isn't shoveled and some of the terrain can be icy and slippery making it difficult to walk up the hill. Overall, it was an amazing winter experience, worthy of the wait!"
"Massive park with lots to see. We went on a 95 degree day so only went to visit the Chalet. We took the Orange line to the Mont Royal station and from there we hopped on the 711 Bus which took us up the mountain. It costs us $3 per adult each way with a free transfer from the train to the bus. We were also told that our 7 year old was free! There are a few stops on the mountain so be sure to check the map to see where you want to be close to. We got off on the stop closest to the Chalet. By the way, there was ample parking there near the Chalet, which we were warned would be pretty filled. I am no sure how much is costs though. Once getting off the bus we walked about 5-10 minutes uphill to the Chalet. The Chalet is beautiful, offering amazing views of the Montreal skyline. There were two ice cream vendors there, who were making a killing on the hot day. There was also a massive Pavilion there which didnt seem to have much but offered shade. Bathrooms maybe?! It was very hot in there (no air conditioning) and smelled pretty bad. Besides offering amazing views, there was also a public piano there, which a few people took it upon themselves to play and entertain the crowd which was definitely a highlight of our visit. After taking a few pics we made our way back down to the Peel Avenue exit. This involved going down lots and lots of stairs. I couldn't imagine going up those stairs on a day as hot as that one. If you plan on going up that way, be prepared by making sure you are healthy and staying hydrated. Also, take your time. Overall we had a great time at this completely free attraction. I would love to return on a cooler day and explore the park some more and also return at night for some amazing nighttime skyline photos. Lots of tripods there by the way for you photographers out there. Enjoy!"
Super awesome sights to see when visiting Montreal. ¬†Amazing views of the city and great photo ops. There is a beautiful building that contains floor to ceiling windows so you can enjoy the view while not freezing your butt off.
Beautiful park with nice walking trails and an awesome view of Montreal. Come here for fresh air or to walk off your food baby.
"Beautiful park with breathtaking views of Montreal! I would definitely recommend this Park to those visiting Montreal. First off, it's free which is always a plus. Secondly, perfect photo op! The park is huge and I see plenty of people running or biking in this area. The only qualm I had was google map kinda confused us when directing us out to the nearest bus stop. I think the park can use a few more signs for those not familiar to help us navigate. Other than that, it was a 10 for me! :)"
"I highly recommend going up to Mont Royale if you visit Montreal. You can skate, inner tube, snow shoe, cross country ski, or just plain walk (bring snow pants and waterproof boots). ""Inaugurated in 1876, the Mount Royal Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the highly skilled designer behind New York's Central Park. (His sons helped design Grant Park in Chicago). It is an ideal site for admiring a wide variety of plants and birds or for enjoying outdoor activities. Les amis de la montagne offer a variety of services and activities that provide wonderful opportunities to discover the beauty and wealth of resources that the park has to offer, including the new permanent exhibition at the Maison Smith and interactive terminals and map. ¬†Take Bus 11 up the mountain and get off after at Maison Smith and make your way to the pavillion by the lake. You can rent inner tubes, skates, snowshoes, and I think cross-country skis there.My friend and I rented snowshoes for an hour ($9CAD) and walked around the trail. You can store all your things in a wooden bin (they rent out locks), or if you don't mind lugging your things around, I would suggest using a backpack. ¬†There's a trail that leads to the Chateau, and you'll have an amazing view of Montreal and its surrounding areas. If you get cold, you can go into the Chateau and warm up near the fireplace, or just rest in one of the wooden Adirondack chairs and get a refreshment (hot or cold) from the vending machines.It's really a great place for families and an awesome way to enjoy the great outdoors.* tourisme-montreal.org/Wh‚Ä¶lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/lea‚Ä¶"
"What an absolutely stunnnig place to spend a day walking around, experiencing the beauty of a created park and lake right next to an expansive walking trail system overlooking the beautiful city of Montr√©al. If you don't do anything else, and are on a tight schedule, this is a must do. You can rent bikes if you want to ride around the trails. People walking should be aware that cyclists are on the move. We were lapped a couple times on the trails by a big riding group, who rang a bell upon approach (per Park rules, and common sense). Unlike the solo rider cruising around Lac aux Castors; he didn't announce himself and nearly ended up in the lake for his carelessness when he practically rode into some ladies who didn't hear him. Ample parking at main park (pay at the ticket dispenser) and a smaller lot offside of the road at the summit overlook. Get out at the latter and climb even higher to reach the Mont Royal Cross, which is illuminated at night. Ladies, dressy strappy heels are not recommended on those dirt pathways. Yup, saw it with our own eyes. And please don't feed the wildlife. Recreational smokers tried to look inconspicuous. Something was a giveaway. LOLThe main park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the Connecticut-born landscape architect and anti-slavery activist, who also designed New York's Central Park. Lac aux Castors was the creation of Frederick Gage Todd, originally from Concord, NH and did his apprenticeship in landscape architecture with Olmsted's firm. There is currently an informative exposition, ""Mont Royal: A Territory to Discover"" in Maison Smith, a 19th century farmhouse. We didn't check out the Maison Smith caf√©. Upper level can be rented out for meeting space. Year-round activities abound in the park for individuals, kids, families and groups (lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act‚Ä¶). Several small construction projects going on during our visit: new interpretive kiosks being built and a playground was under renovation. What a treasure for residents and visitors!"
"I believe that Park Mont Royal and Parc du Mont-Royal are the same park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. ¬†I wrote another entry for Parc du Mont-Royal. ¬†Here it is:Parc du Mont-Royal is in the beautiful city of Montreal! ¬†If you like to walk and you enjoy nature, then going to this lovely park is a ""Must Do""!! ¬†You will be rewarded with the best views of the city, if you hike to the top.That's all I got to say, just do it! ¬†This truly is one of the best parks anywhere!"
"I love this nature patch in the middle of the city. I pass by it every day on my way to work and run up the hill (its not a real mountain after all) every week (a wonderful trail of about 5K all the way to the top, Highly recommended!).During the summer and spring you will find a cool drum circle on the foot of the parc (near the statue) called a Tam-Tam. During the fall this is a place of magic everything turns red and you must take millions of picturesDuring the winter people come here to cross country ski, snow show and enjoy the snow.And thats without mentioning the wonderful views from the top (a photographer dream) the beautiful walking paths, the nice lake at the top, the mid-evil fights and the practicing acrobats (during the tam-tams)...just go there"
"When I checked into my hotel in Montreal, I asked the front desk where were the best spots in town for a photography enthusiast like me. They kindly directed me here, so I put it on my to-do list for the following day.So that morning came, and after having breakfast, I was ready to venture out to see what Montreal had to offer. I decided on stopping by here first. Navigation sent me up the hill into a pay lot. After paying the parking, I was directed to the scenic overlook by friendly locals. A quick five minute walk led me to an overlook that portrayed the Montreal skyline beautifully. The view was spectacular (check pics). There is also a building which I assume can be used as a party hall. And who wouldn't want to have a party with such a view in the distance?The rest of the park includes trails leading in and out of the heavily wooded area. Many fitness minded locals shared the paths with me, and it was a great exercise before continuing on my long drive to Portland, Maine.This place is definitely a must, come check it out!"
"My very first stop in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, invited for a hike with friends to the gazebo (or what do you call the sightseeing paid-binocular-zoom tour area where we all take selfies) at the top. I had only been there about 12 hours and our first trip was to the famed ¬†""The Mountain"" like other University students (well I did not enroll yet, that came second).Like Lexington Market (from the state Maryland I was born), just the stores do not sell beautiful, exquisite, intricately designed knives, for style, at every store, instead they've installed trees (the green kind with leaves) versus Lexington Market removed all signs of nature, for style.Same in terms of 420 smoking at any hour night or day somebody has a lighter you can hear, literally hear. Either that or you will hear unequivocal coughing. Be prepared to be offered and propositioned to smoke, exactly like Lexington Market again. So just say no if you need to if you're encountering that, they're used to the certain majority of people who say yes actually.I think a good/fair comparison between Lexington Market and The Mountain is to be made just in terms of: (a) seating made for humans and (b) actual organic nature (to avoid mentioning (c) the store comparisons where only there has weapons, while both have equal hospitals, only there has knives at all stores at the front for quick buying). Montreal Quebec believes it has people there, Baltimore Maryland did not codify that yet.Otherwise has same share of people who are broke and not broke just very amazingly quizical and puzzling difference from how people are treated by default. (Default is a computer word, many people bring their computers to study at The Mountain, versus in Lexington Market you might get told by a security guard to move because you look too good, at The Mountain the police sit the same style as people around during en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta‚Ä¶ Tam Tams)."
"Best place in all of Montr√©al. ¬†The view of the island and St Lawrence River is very peaceful. ¬†On a hot summer day, you can go inside the lookout and buy a glass of ice water for less than CAN$0.30.The walk to the lookout is simple. ¬†Follow the stairs upwards until you see a classic building and a square filled with onlookers taking in the money shot city view. ¬†Close by is the Cross of Montreal. ¬†Don't forget that too. ¬†On weekends, parking is around at the foot of Mont Royal. ¬†To get to the top is roughly a 20-30 minute walk.In three visits here, this is my favorite place to be in Montreal."
"30 min walk/hike up the mountain for the views everyone else brags about.Clean, and big park--lots of fun stuff coming on here.Come here on Sundays in spring & summer for the Tam-Tam. INteresting people enjoying life, making music, selling stuff, drinking & smoking. Place gets packed but its such a great time! Free!"
"As a New Yorker, no walk is too long, and no hike is too high and Mont-Royal was a wonderful day trip to the top. We did not take the marked trail or the path of steps which most people tend to take. Although we did take an off-beaten path (and cough, maybe hopped an illegal fence or two), it was beautifully serene and is a wilderness escape in the middle of the bustling city. I cannot say enough great things about this park, there are many great things to discover, and greenery to immerse oneself in. This park was probably one of my favorite part about Montreal, so if you are an out-of-towner, DON'T MISS IT! I believe there are buses you can take up to the Chateau and you can rent bikes as well, or if you're a little adventurous like us, take the hike up or the off-the-beaten path (I shouldn't condone illegal fences, my bad). ¬†The best part: DON'T MISS THE VIEW FROM THE CHATEAU!A few cons: 1. Very little/no English signage, not all of us know French, especially since it is such a tourist attraction.2. Limited drinks & food at the top, only vending machines.3. Bugs/mosquitoes galore. BRING REPELLANT. I walked away with approx. 37 bug bites, not exaggerating. Remember: To bring snacks (unless you want to get skinny on your hike)To bring drinks/water (unless you are a human cactus)To bring your sneakers (unless you can hike in flip-flops like me)To bring bug spray (unless you want to get eaten alive)To bring a camera (amazing views galore)"
"A beautiful place to spend a day walking around with the family. Visit the location to experience the beautiful view at the top of the city of Montr√©al. A must to track the top of the Mount when visiting the city.Tip: there are short cut paths/rides to the top, so if you are with kids be sure to still consider visiting."
"Yes, it's a park but I would've loved to spend the whole day here. It seems like there's a biking and hiking trail to the top and stairs all the way up- We were pressed for time so we didn't get to hike up or climb the stairs all the way- we managed to drive up to the look out.Great views of the city! I bet it's nice around fall, with the leaves changing colors and the air crisp and cool. ¬†We used google maps on our phone for directions and it seems like we didn't see the Chateau that the other people mentioned. I guess I need to get a better address for this place."
"I visited here a few weeks ago and I think it was bad timing because there was still snow melting, leaf-less trees, and a cloudy sky. I walked up to the view point which only took a couple of minutes and I had very high expectations. Unfortunately it was shot down due what I mentioned above. I think the best time to visit this place is the fall because the trees will be different colors and it will really make the city view beautiful! The small hike up also would not be that slippery from ice/snow. Parking was not bad at all. It was definitely full but you can get parking if you wait a couple minutes. I also think it was disappointed because I have seen the city view in big cities like SFO, LA, NYC so Montreal was definitely a smaller one and shouldn't be used to compare. It is definitely a must see if you're touring Montreal!"
"Over our summer visit, we knew this was a destination. But it's ride, not the destination? Haaaaa...Speaking of the ride, we rented a couple city bikes by the foot of the hill and started trecking up the hill to the optimal 'oo-ing and ahh-ing' spot. About 20 minutes in... we realized we didn't know how long it would take. I did know at that point that I had already sweated off what little makeup and dry shampoo I had on so I was in it to win it. ...it took about 42 minutes going slowly uphill. (Make sure you understand you'll pay a late fee on getting that city rental bike back down.) The pathway was mostly shaded by arching trees and the view up top totally would make anyone feel glorious."
"I don't know why some people think it's a strenuous walk from Rue Pins/Rue Peel steps. It took me 20 minutes and it was a straight shot. It's shady and there are benches and water fountains along the way if you need to stop. The chalet has chairs, cafe, and gift shop. The view is pretty amazing as well."
"20 min away from the belvedere Camille Houle, ¬†this Parc has a great View of Montreal. Very romantique for Couples, you can have nice and quite pik-nik, a small walk or watch the sunset. They have an outdoor Piano and people actually bring Drones, They have a small indoor Restaurant too."
"You cannot ask for more than a mountain in the city of Montreal. Mind you the summit is just under 800 ft of elevation which is easily a quarter of what a real hike on a mountain would be, BUT.... the mountain is simply beautiful and well maintained for a nice stroll throughout the year. It has three main points: Chalet du Mont Royal, Mount Royal Cross and Belv√©d√®re Camillien-Houde. The mountain offers different trails to accommodate bikers, runners or walkers. I live about a block from the first trailhead and it takes me no more than 30 minutes to reach the cottage or 40 to reach the cross from home."
Definitely a great place for a walk. We wanted to just do the look out but we're heading from the mont royal metro stop. It was around 2.1 miles but we would of loved to run it had we known. This is Central Park on a mountain essentially. Definitely recommend if it's nice out.
"Montreal's mountain! ¬†The road winds around and up with views at several stops. We simply asked a cab driver (John is all I remember but he was great) to take us up and back. We like easy but it was pricey. ¬†Be sure to stop at the overlook for the view and photos. Breathtaking fall colors dotted the hills below and then a view of the magnificent city of Montreal. Lots of people were out jogging, biking and walking in the Parc during our visit. ¬†It's a must see for anyone visiting Montreal. ¬†Tr√®s cool, mes amis."
"Very easy to get to with nice views of the city. There are a few ways to get there -- if you have your own car you can drive to the parking lot that is on Chemin Remembrance. You could be adventurous and bike up this same road to the top but that is a major climb. You can also hike fairly easily to the top -- we went through the Cemetery from the North Entrance as we were staying behind Mont Royal in Outremont. The initial part of this path was a bit steep but nothing too intense for an average person. For some reason I kind of expected a grassy area where you could relax and even have a picnic if you wanted at the top but it is not like that at all. There is a strange cottage building (the Chalet) that looks like a train station inside but had nothing except access to bathrooms and a small gift shop (with some cool shirts actually). Otherwise it is just a bunch of different walking trails and then the main attraction is the big open square area for viewing the city with some steps that you can sit on. Make sure you get to the chalet though! There is a small stop area off the road that has views of the city before you walk to the top and I wonder if some people think that is THE view -- it is not. You can also continue walking further up to the cross (Croix) but don't expect much when you get there.Anyway, overall it's a must-see in Montreal in my opinion but also a nice way to start your morning with some activity!"
"Worth the hike up! Did this in the winter, a little tough with snow but still beautiful at the top. Skiing, spikes or snowshoes would make it fun!"
"If you're in the area you should absolutely make this a part of your excursion. ¬†It's completely walk-able and much smaller than I envisioned looking at the map. ¬†There is plenty of parking and a flat all day parking fee so you don't have to worry about time constraints. ¬†We also saw a number of buses and stops right at the entrance so it may be something to look into if you do not have a car at your disposal. ¬†The park provides great views of Montreal so grab your camera. ¬†The lake area has paddle boats available for rental. If you forgot a water, there are vendors and spots to purchase a bottle. ¬†It's a walk in the park and not a hike so good for people of a all ages. :)Tips: Great spot to bring and have a picnic. ¬†Also, may be worth coming at sunset to see the lit up cross and skyline. ¬†I will most definitely do that next time."
A great place to spend a couple hours hiking in the woods but also get a great view of the city. ¬†A very peaceful place after the bustle of the city.If you're a tourist (as I was) I'd recommend you take bus 11 up to the top of the hill to get out and look around but then take bus 711 down so you can stop at St. Joseph's Oratory.
Beautiful views of Montr√©al on a sunny day. You can see for miles out to Mont-Bruce. The day I was there in early May 2018 was busy but not packed. The parking area is a short 15 min walk on a dirt trail that is low impact even for a stroller. The price to park is $3.00 for an hour or $10 for the day. Performance artists were there at the time with a three piece band. The Chalet is large open area that has some great paintings of the settlement of Montr√©al along the upper walls. They have no area for concessions but do have a small souvenir shop.
"Great park, including a mountain! You can take a BUS to the top of this mountain, which is the coolest thing EVER. Even in winter, this is a fun attraction."
"So as it turns out, I am out of shape. Like REALLY out of shape.The boyf (coined it, don't try to steal it) and I parked at the bottom, gave each other a really empathetic look and climbed up our first flight of stairs. After the 6th step, I decided I needed to get back into the gym ASAP. Our goal was to reach the platform which boasts the city views, so we figured the hike would be worth it. Bikers zoomed past us, dedicated joggers ran by us, families with kids even trekked it up. I thought I saw a 5 year old pointing and laughing at me. Called me a lazyass under her breath. Somewhere, we took the wrong turn and ended up hiking up to a beautiful lake and open picnic space. We were so tired that we ended our journey there and even considered becoming homeless just so we don't have to walk back down (joking). But I have to say as exhausting as it was climbing up a damn mountain, the lake view made it worthwhile."
"There are many Parks in Montreal- one with the most breath taking view of Montreal. I have been here a couple of times at different points during the year. Does have history so read up if your into it:)!Mount Royal is a mid size volcanic hill adjacent to downtown Montreal. We decided to walk from St Laurent street post lunch from Swartz. Many ways to get there. Our ""trusty"" Map-quest took us via Pin- Street. We ended up on the Stadium side of McGill university. People were friendly along the way leading us to our destination. Option 1: Scenic Route windy paved road for a ""casual"" to ""running path up the hill/mountain - vast trees - small creek- some wildlife ? (We saw a huge raccoon, squirrels and a gofer :). Can take a bike up- be prepared to trek up hill.Option 2: stairs - from intersection Pins/Peel. Goes right up to the View Point. Watch out for those avid fitness junkies ( all positive) that are running up and down pass you.Option 3: Bus 80 or I believe there's an express.Option 4: taxi- expensive but good choice if raining or snowing :).Option 5: unbeaten / unpaved path through the trees. Any way up will also take you back down!Also people are so friendly - all local. I am sure they were thinking why is this one attempting this with a cane! Doable ! Attire: we dressed casually as did the locals. Some wearing flip flops! Be prepared though- it's not a stroll unless u make it one. Benches along the way. Take water and do take some snacks. The beaver ""lake"" small quaint resting spot with man made pool. The Chateau at the top- nice architecture but just a space to rest - mostly everyone is outdoors enjoying the view - taking pics and listening to music. There's a few Popsicle vendors and unfortunately NO cafe - just vending machines. So decided if you want to eat prior it take snacks with you. During winter/early spring when raining or snowing - it wasn't this lively and we got taken to an adjacent smaller view point. We decided going down - due to time and because I had a cane - Option2 was somewhat reasons for me :). Once we got to the bottom of the stairs - very steep walk down the rest of the way to McGill campus in the Middl of downtown. Worth it !"
"Short and fairly easy ""hike"" (more like stair climbing) to see some amazing views of Montreal. I thought the uphill climb from Peel Station to the base of the mountain was harder than the actual the mountain itself. Either way, any exertion was definitely worth it for the panorama at the top. My boyfriend and I came in the spring, and seeing everything in bloom was breathtaking. Wish I could've spent more time there (apparently there's a lake!), but we were so exhausted from a day of sightseeing that we only walked around for a little bit more before heading back down."
"Oh, yeah, this is definitely a place to go! But it has to be good weather (not too hot, not too cold) because the stairs can be a quite a journey and an exercise! I saw people half way, not being able to continue their journey because they were too tired and too hot. So make sure you bring some energy booster and a bottle of water! It's worth the journey, the view is amazing! Loved it.I was disappointed by the prices up there. The souvenirs are so expensive, oh my God. One simple postcard cost $1.25 and bottle of water $4.00! (So like I said, bring your own). You can fill up your bottle downstairs at the water fountain, no need to buy water from machine. I actually think they placed a vending machine on purpose, so people don't complain about high prices!"
"Due to the fluctuating exchange rate, a four star review of a park in Canada is roughly equivalent to a five star review of a park in the US.Nah, I'm kidding. ¬†I reserve five stars only for Central Park and Prospect Park (also Olmstead parks). ¬†But Mont Royal Park is pretty awesome. ¬†There is plenty to see all over the mountain and the views of Montreal are terrific. ¬†I love approaching it from Rue Rachel because the angel statue there (Sir George Etienne Carter) is pretty impressive. ¬†You really get a sense of the scale of the place that you don't get from approaching it from the south, in my opinion. ¬†There are so many paths that you can discover a variety of things as you climb toward the summit. ¬†I once met a friendly horse not too far from the giant cross.This is a real gem and it seems that Monteralers (Montreal-ites?) really appreciate this place. ¬†When I've been there it has been spotless and well tended. ¬† It's very cool. ¬†Or as they say in Montreal, tres cool."
"An absolute MUST SEE in Montreal! Here, you can get a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. There is a really nice chateau up on the top that holds events, lots of different spots along the way up to stop and check out the view as well, and a large courtyard in front of the chateau that I believe is the highest point that overlooks the city. In the courtyard, there is a super cute piano that is up for public use, a photo opportunity frame, several binoculars, and an ice cream vendor.You can get up the mountain by bus or on foot, but I highly recommend to go by bus. We took the bus up and walked a little bit further to get to the very top, and then we walked back down. When you feel like giving up on your hike, DON'T! The view is absolutely worth every step you take! It's also in a wooded area so you don't get baked in the sun. We were blessed with a beautiful day with just enough sunshine and shade. There are a lot of tourists that come here, as well as a lot of locals who come for some great exercise. Make sure you bring your walking shoes!!!"
"You can easily spend a whole day exploring Parc du Mont-Royal, but here's the lazy American's guide (aka you have a car and or you're on a time crunch): PARKINGDrive in through Remembrance and park near Maison Smith (Smith House), just on the right past the safety/police station. It was tough to find since there were lots of construction going on which cloaked the exterior of Maison Smith. MONT ROYAL CHALET + SCENIC CITY OVERLOOK I was expecting to walk up a ton of stairs, but we ended up following a group of kids on a field trip up a widened path that shortly led us up to the chalet. Stroller and powerchair friendly with a slight incline. After we took in the view of downtown Montreal and glimpsed inside the chalet, we rounded a 2-ish km pathway. The easy uphill walk featured the croix du mont royal (cross) and ended at a large antennae (very anticlimatic), before we went back to the the chalet.MAISON SMITHBack around where we parked, we went inside Maison Smith to use their restrooms (located in a cool cavernous basement), checked out their informative exhibits about the park, and munched on some lunch in their cafe.LE STADE SCENIC OVERLOOKOn our way out on Camillien-Houde, we stopped for a few minutes at the parking friendly overlook of Le Stade Olympique.Signage was minimal and rather poor, which is why I recommend researching ahead of time so you're not wandering aimlessly around secondary trails. If you like hanging out in cemeteries (you creepster), we passed by two on our way out. The ony thing I regret is not having enough time to make the trek to Lac au Castors (a reclaimed bog/large picturesque pond with water activities)."
"Designed by the sameguy who made central park and the boston common, this is beautifully planned and provided a challenging hike for those seeking it as well as an easy route for families. Excellent city views."
What's not to love about an amazing public park in the middle of the city. I remember when I used to live in Montreal we would take advantage of this park all the time. It was nice to go to the top and hike it all the way down. Still as amazing as ever. The city does a great job of keeping it up.
"Climbing to the Mont is a Montreal must-do, if only to justify eating poutine afterwards. WINTER WARNING: they do not plow the path that leads you from the bottom of the hill to the chalet (on the other hand, the stair portions are fairly well-shoveled). This leads to an exciting winter adventure for the true urban outdoorsmen who have come equipped with their snowshoes and skis; otherwise, bring a toasty and waterproof pair of boots for your trek, or risk your tootsies getting a lil' snowy.The view is very much worth it and the chalet is toasty and warm.You can take the #11 bus back to Mont-Royal station if you're tired, or you can climb down on your own-- it takes way less time than going up! Oh, and I guess you can take the bus there, too, but what's the fun in that?"
"This is a must see, while visiting Montreal. My cab ride over, was a bit rude. He stated that he didn't think I was fit enough, to hike up to the top. Well I did it! And the view was astonishing. It was breathtaking, I loved it. The hike wasn't easy, but I did it.I'd go back the next time I'm in Montreal."
"One of the great parks in the city. Very fortunate to live close by so we enjoy it in the summer and winter. We go skating on the refrigerated outdoor rink as soon as it is cold enough. So when other outdoor rings are close this one will be open and the rent skates, ski and snowshoes. $9 for a 2 hour rental is a bit much, but still a great option. In the summer, lots of BBQ and picnic options. We go to jog on top of the mountain."
"Put this at the top of your list of things you must do in this beautiful city. ¬†For those of you who are runners, starting at the entrance on Rue Peel, running to the top of Mont Royal chateau then doing the loop above the chateau and the loop around the lake rounds out a 5 mile course if you're looking to get a little extra mileage in. Very dog friendly if you want to bring your four legged friend. Most of the trek is dirt so leave your fashionable wedge sandals at home and bring your running shoes."
"Made the trek up multiple steps and lots of hills, but it was well worth the view. A restaurant or bar on the top would really be a treat, but the view is what this city is all about. If you're in town, make sure you venture up Mount Royal."
"Mont Royal Park is a go to place at any given point of the year. Easy to access by walking up the path, taking a bike or simply driving up you can visit this beautiful park at no cost. Plenty of parking is available albeit it not being free.There are several view points that you can visit to get a gorgeous view of the city since Mont Royal is conveniently located smack in the middle of it. Beaver lake is nice to visit, especially with friends and/or family. Man-made and shallow it still contains life with a variety of birds and fish. You can even take a boat and go around the lake. Feel free to come and picnic or lie down on the grass and take some sun rays.There is plenty of walking to be had and you'll find many runners going about their business.I'd recommend to bring water and snacks, they kind of rip you off here so make sure to grab it prior to coming here from a small market or corner store.Make sure that check their website they tend to have several activities going on at all times."
"If you're touring Montreal, you better make it to Parc du Mount Royal. Amazing view of the entire city!"
Awesome view. I recommend you drive there instead of taking public transit in the winter.
"I climbed it!--in the early spring, not too green, not too cold but some light hail and need for a sweater. ¬† I had a great friend who walked me through the majority of the park, my legs were worn out the next day but this is certainly a highlight of the trip. ¬† There is a panoramic view of the city from one viewpoint, great running/walking/biking paths, some lakes (artificial), lodges that feel like ski lodges, a religious view from the large cross which can be seen from above. ¬†Not too many cities have an adjacent natural perch that is taller than most of the buildings, this is a natural treat for the city."
Came here on a past trip and loved it. Large park in the middle of the city. Lots of paths and trails. Many people were running or biking around. You can also hike up to the top. Must visit when in Montreal.
"This place has the most beautiful view of a city that I've ever seen. I can hang out here and enjoy ¬†the view for hours. It's great. ¬†My wife and I went here a couple of times when we were in Montreal, both day and night. Please do not come here in the daytime and miss coming at night. The daytime view of the city is great but the nighttime view is incredibleMontreal has became one of my favorite city to visit, and this park was one of the reason. After a long day sightseeing, it is so refreshing to just end your night here and just enjoy the view. I love that this place is completely free. I love that people just enjoy the weather and drink wine from the bottle. Montreal is truly an amazing city."
"Hiking up Mont-Royal was on my list of things to conquer while in Montreal and conquer I did. My BBF and I decided this would be a good morning activity to get our exercise in for the day. We walked up Peele Street next to McGill's campus until we arrived at the bottom of the mountain and then made our way up. I would suggest wearing sneakers and workout gear for this hike; you'll work up a sweat climbing the 400 steps of a continuous staircase before arriving at the Chalet. If you have the energy and are able to hike some more you can continue on a dirt path to the right and hike a few paths around in a circle, making your way up to the Cross. After your hiking adventure you can head back down to the Chalet and relax, enjoying the view of the city. There is a bus that can take you up and down as well. If you decide to make the hike like we did; give yourself at least two hours hiking through all the trails to the cross and back down."
This place offers a nice view of Montreal. It was a short walk from the bus stop.
"There's a few ways to get to this park....easiest if you are taking public transportation:- via the metro, get off at Station Mont-Royal on the orange line- go to the bus stop behind the metro station on Rue Rivard and get on bus 11 toward Montagne. This bus will go up the mountain saving you a very long walk up unless you plan on biking up there. You can still walk around the many trails once you get off the bus stop there that's near a very large parking area. You can head up a trail that will take you to the top of the peak where you will get a very nice panoramic view of Montreal. Walking up and looking around will be less than an hour unless you want to spend more time around the trails. I didn't have that luxury so we just did this part and left even though there was lots more to see.Then once you're done the walk take the bus 11 back down the mountain to St. Laurent Blvd. Get off at that street and walk to 3895 St. Laurent Blvd to Schwartz's for short wait and a great Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Perfect way to experience two great Montreal spots!"
Great setting overlooking the city of Montreal. There is a huge park located on the top of the mount. The cross is the highest point and nothing can be built higher than the cross in Montreal.
"Mount Royal was very tiring but well worth the trip. Make sure you have water, bug spray and a really good pair of sneakers when hiking up the mountain. It honestly wasn't too bad, but the slant was pretty steep coming from the metro and the stairs were long going up from the entrance. However, we survived it and the view was simply breathtaking. The view of the city was unbelievable from up high. I'm really happy that we stopped here during our vacation. Our legs were sore for 2 days afterward, but I would do it again if the opportunity presented itself."
"The locals call it ""La Montaigne"" and you can climb to the top for a great view of the downtown (""centre-ville"") high rises and bridges. Several excellent spots for taking pictures along the way.Unlike SOME Yelpers, I didn't cheat and take the bus. But let me tell you, I think I had at least three coronaries on the trails. I made the mistake that if I could climb Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, I could handle anything these overly polite Canadians could throw at me. Next time, I'll bus it!A good amount of litter here and there, which is quite disheartening. Even in the spots where there was a trashbin nearby, you couldn't make a small effort? Losers.From the lookouts, great views. Love it and well worth it.From the Mont Royal Metro station, you can ascend the mountain. Or walk up from Rue Peel where there are stairs. I came down the Peel trail which was much easier and led directly to a pub!"
"There's not very much to the overview. The view faces the downtown area, which isn't all that photogenic. Spent 10 minutes here and moved on.There's a ch√¢teau right there with restrooms and $4 vending machine waters, but it's essentially empty save a small info area and an overpriced gimmicky tourist shop. Pretty inside, but not a destination.This spot is also far from a secret. Everyone was here. The hike is easy so it's very crowded. There's a city bus that runs to the base of it, to the point where you walk maybe 1/5 mile and surprise, you're at the top.Perhaps the surrounding hiking trails are nice, but if you're coming for the view be prepared to share it with 100 sweaty people from Boston, and say things to yourself like, ""Really? This is it?"""
Beautiful Park that was designed by the same landscape architect who designed Central Park in NYC and Stanley Park in Vancouver
"Great view of the city especially at night. Was there last night for a art show and then electric music concert. Crowd was nice,music interesting. But again the 4 stars are for the view.FYI, the walk up may be intense for some (lots of stairs) best to take one of the buses (11 I believe) and let it drop you of at a location which is more flat and way easier to walk."
"The best view of Montreal! A place to have pic nic, walk, have a romantic talk or just to test how in shape people can be!Not made for people with reduced mobility, the paths are very well indicated and there are many buses of the STM that take you there (165, 11, 80) There are many refreshments in a small house close to the Chalet, but in the chalet there are vending machines and are expensive, so make sure you get water and food... In winter, Beaver's lake is great for skating!"
"**Bring your walking shoes**One of the gems of Montreal. A beautiful scenic park, but quite the hike to get to the top. ¬†There's approximately 15 flights of stairs when entering from the Drummond entrance. ¬†I think there is less if you enter on Rachel street. ¬†This doesn't count the numerous hills you climb to reach the top. ¬†Once you get to the top, the hike becomes worth it. ¬†The views are incredible. ¬†You are above every building and get to see the beautiful city of Montreal. ¬†Atop the mount there is also a chalet for you to warm up or cool down depending on the temperature. ¬†There is vending machines, seating and wi-fi in this chalet. ¬†This is definitely a must-visit on your trip to Montreal."
I read lot's of reviews before deciding if this was 1. A trek ¬†2. worth it.I will say the hike was not so bad and getting there was super easy for me from where I was staying. You can take a bus to get as close as possible to the top and the walk it not so bad. Just do it.
Beautiful park with a beautiful view. The only thing is that the road in the parking lot is a little confusing. Parts of it are just a bike and bus lane and a lot of people didn't seem to get it. This was actually a story on the news the night after I went because it's such a big problem. If you have time you should really go because it provides beautiful views
"The number 1 spot you have to visit when in Montreal! The whole city is founded around this little mountain. Such a lovely place. You can take the fairly short walk up the mountain - it will take you less than an hour to walk from the bottom and up the top. You can take the stairs after a little walking to reach the top faster. It is about a 5 km walk up till you reach the stairs. The view from the top is amazing - you can see all of the city. All the buildings, all areas, the river. Definitely worth it! Go there on a sunny day, on a snowy day, at sunset or sunrise - every single view is amazing. When you live in Montreal you have to see the mountain in all types of weathers - in sun, snow, fall, spring, colors, rain - every setting is beautiful in its own way. It is also a perfect place for a good run - the path is not to steep for a run. And it is even possible to bike your way to the top as well."
"This park has many trails that range from wide and paved to narrow and wooded. Not knowing there were 400 of them, we started at the steps on the McGill University side and took them all the way to the top, which was a LOT more strenuous and less scenic than we had intended. ¬†We got a map once we reached the top, and took a more wooded, meandering trail through the woods on the way back down. The whole park is beautiful and there are interesting stops throughout. Next time I'll start with a map and take a picnic lunch to enjoy by the lake."
"If you are a visitor get a $10 day pass for the bus, take a 129 or other local bus from downtown (or a stop close to you) to the Parc Mont Royal stop. Switch to the 11 or 711 to take the bus through the park, getting on/off where you like. This bus also goes to St Joseph Oratoire so you should see that too (impressive). Can then take 435 back to downtown (or other depending where you are staying). Get the Chrono bus app to help you get around. Nice snack bar at Ch√¢teau but mostly sweets. Bring water, and sandwiches. Beautiful views as everyone else has said. Nice park trails too."
"Park close to Schwartz, and hike to the peak -- 30-40 min hike, a lot of stairs, so be prepared. The views are incredible. At the peak, you'll find a gift shop, restrooms, and drinking fountains but I do really recommend packing a small picnic, or snack, and enjoying the surroundings. After you're done, head to Schwartz for a sandwich."
"Must see! Great place for a walk, bike ride, or hike. Park is huge and the views are stunning. We went off the main trail and got into a pretty steep area that I wish would have been more clearly blocked off.. several other people made the same mistake."
"Lovely park. ¬†We were there on a very chilly, blustery day so the open spaces rough but the park is large and very nice. ¬†We had a tough time locating look-out which seems ridiculous once you get there and see how large it is. ¬†I think it was partially due to poor signage. ¬†Nice view once you get up there though."
"From the mount, you've an impressive view of the city, even in poor weather.Even though there's tons of folks boating, running, and walking, there's still tons of space for you to have space. During the winter, hit up the ice rink for your ice rinking needs.Check out the public art: sculptures fill at least one field here, and there's ducks all over. (Yes, ducks are public art.)"
"This park is awesome super accessible and clean. Its a little tough to find the entrance but its on the West side of the park. the parking is cheap and from the parking lot its a 10 minute walk to the view of the downtown part of the city which is well worth it. I wont add anymore photos since there already are so many. the tulip garden is great and after that you can walk the whole top of the hill in 30 minutes to an hour. I would also recommend to stop by the cross which is at the East side of the top of the park, maybe a 15 minute walk from the view overlooking the downtown. (These locations would be if you were facing north of looking at a map) I was very surprised with how clean the park is, I'm very doubtful you would find a park this clean in the United States."
"Beautiful, beautiful view at the top after a tough climb! Definitely a tourist place, there were lots of people, but very picturesque and nice place to watch the sunset. There's a piano at the top, and it's always nice to hear people play for strangers. Just watch out for the mosquitos."
"Not exactly a place to experience nature -- you can drive or take a bus and get close to all the major destinations -- but a nice urban park to get away and enjoy some decent views. Such a high point in an otherwise pretty flat landscape is a bit unusual. Some of the paths get a little further away from the big crowds, so explore the forests a bit if you have the time."
I always love walking up the mountain when I come to Montreal. It's a great view and a refreshing break from the city. I highly recommend it!
"An absolute must-do in nice weather in Montreal. ¬†Here are your steps to enjoyment:1) Sit at the base and enjoy the Tam-Tam's. ¬†What are Tam-Tams? ¬†Essentially large brasilian-style drum circles. ¬†Of course, there's all the standard hippies and pot smoking you'd expect to accompany it, but there's also families and couples, and when I was there children being rolled around in life-size hamster balls.2) Get your exercise in and walk to the top. ¬†You can opt for the gentle gradual path with lots of switchbacks, or go straight up the middle with a shortcut. ¬†Either way, it's beautifully shaded. ¬†There will be stairs at the end, so be prepared. ¬†You could also bike.3) Enjoy the plateau up top. ¬†Take in the view. ¬†Sit at the temporary bar. ¬†Enjoy whoever happens to be playing the public piano at the time...the guy got applause when we were there. ¬†4) Walk back down, and hop on a convenient Bixi to continue your Montreal tour."
"May 16, 2013This is one of my favorite places in the world. ¬†SO. MUCH. GREEN.We walked up via Rue Peel -- it took so long because I kept stopping to take pictures. ¬†All the greenery is just absolutely ridiculously gorgeous. ¬†I LOVE IT!! ¬†It's a combination of stairs and slight incline. ¬†There are many joggers along the path. ¬†At the top, there's an amazing view of Montreal. ¬†If you could only go to one place in Montreal, this should be it. ¬†GO!"
"Parc du Mont Royal is a large green space with plenty of room to to frolic, play and exercise. The views from above the city are phenomenal. Take time to stroll through the cemetery as well. The area is lovely and there are additional views to be had from this area. To have such a large area of green space within a city is such a gift-get out there and enjoy it!"
"It was a pleasure hiking this with snow engulfing the pathway, once you get to the top you get a grand view of the entire city of Montreal which Is perfect for pictures and creating memories."
"Who wants to spend time outdoors in Montreal in the dead of winter? Well apparently... a lot of people! I went back in January, after a blizzard had hit the city so there was lots of snow. Some friends and I decided to head towards Mont Royal to work off our lunch of poutine.We were pleasantly surprised to discover that not only was the park designed by Frederick Law Olmstead (of Central Park and Boston's Emerald Necklace fame), but that it was teeming with tourists and locals alike wanting to get out and about. There is a flat meandering path (the Olmstead path) that winds its way around towards the cross at the pinnacle of the hill. Or you can take short cuts up impromptu paths and stairs. We immediately wished we had rented sleds or cross country skis after seeing many an enthusiast pass us by.It was very much a lovely excursion that gave us a different, woodsy glimpse of the city. Winter foot gear is a must, though, at this time of the year. Some of the terrain can be quite slippery.I would love to go back in the spring or summer!"
"This is perhaps one of my favorite places in Montreal. I love climbing the mountain, starting off by McGill University and then up to the top for the panoramic view.One can see for miles and miles on a clear day, just breathtaking. Fall foliage is the best time in my opinion.It can be a hearty climb for the young or even a frail elder can walk up the long ""s"" shaped ¬†road to the top.C'est Bon!"
"If it's a nice enough day and you have a lot of extra energy, this is a great park to home and explore. ¬†It's a difficult walk all the way up to the top regardless which route you take. ¬†There are stairs which are steep and seemingly endless which will take you right up to the Chalet and the great views from the top of the mountain. ¬†Another option would be the paths which are slightly less steep but a much longer and a slower route. ¬†Neither one sound appealing, take the 11 bus. ¬†Once at the top of the mountain, you can explore the green spaces, check out the Notre Dame des Neiges cemetery and Lac aux Castors. ¬†It's a difficult place to visit but the views on a clear day are worth the efforts."
"This park is gigantic! If you drive to the top, you can find a parking lot near by and hike the remainder up to the summit. ¬†When you get to that area, there will be a building and there is an area that overlooks the city. ¬†These are some of the best views in all of Montreal. ¬†The best part? It's basically FREE, besides paying for the parking."
If you like hiking. You can get an amazing view of the city from the top of chateau Mont Royal. I wish we were here during sunset. Wow that would look amazing.
Very nice weather in Montreal now to go up to the Peak of Mont-Royal. The view in the forest is even nicer! The color of trees are amazing!
"Built by the same guy who built central park in NYC, this park feels very open, spacious and friendly with interesting things seemingly at every turn.  I would allot several hours for this place as we did not and we were in a rush, plus it started to rain. Has a great view of old Montreal and the cemetery next to it is very impressive as well."
"This is a great stop in Montreal. ¬†It would be a great place to do a run if I had the time. ¬†It's very beautiful and green, and it looks like there are different trails that you can use if you had the time and ability. ¬† I was with my parents, brother, husband and son, and it would have been nice if there were a few more activities to do. ¬†We went up to the chalet, but it was soooo hot that we could only stay for so long. ¬†I asked the information guy if there was a playground, but he showed me on the map that there was only one, and that it was not under shade. ¬†The view that the chalet's large patio offered of downtown and greater Montreal was very nice. ¬†I'd love to see it in the winter as well. ¬†It did find it odd that we had to pay for parking in this park, despite the large amount of space there was."
"Short 'n sweet review: ¬†This place is basically the High Park of Montreal...with paid parking, even though there's tons of it! ¬†:( ¬†Boo.According to another review, it takes approx. 45mins to hike up. ¬†Parking is like $3/hr. ¬†There are tons of trails, so it may take you a while to orientate yourself. ¬†So I'd only come here IF I had time on my MTL itinerary. ¬†Tons of runners/joggers/bikers/family/company picnics type place, if that's your sorta thing. ¬†With all the construction/rd closures in the city, it does take a bit of time to drive here, so again, ONLY if you have time. ¬†Otherwise, it's a skip for me!"
"The best place for all your outdoor needs. Whether you want to go for a jog, enjoy a beautiful scenery over the city, take a romantic walk with your beau, have a picnic with your friends in the summer, or need a spot to meditate, this is the place. Vibrant and calming at the same time."
Beautiful place for a run in the morning. Incredible views of Montreal and easily accessible. I felt quite safe running here alone since there were many runners and cyclists.
"Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park and Prospect Park. He also designed Grand Army Plaza, Fort Tryon, Morningside Park, Eastern Parkway... (heck, he coined the word ""parkway""!) So it was interesting to see an aesthetic I'd considered so ""New York"" pop up on my recent visit to Montreal.Montreal's namesake park is, like all the Olmsted creations I've had the pleasure of experiencing, a peaceful expanse that comes with the profound feeling that you're smack in the middle of a bustling city, but at the same time cleanly sealed off from it. ¬†The park is basically a giant hill filled with gorgeous trees. It's a lot more interesting than any ol' tourist park, because it's an adventure in itself! You have to climb up a zigzag of stairs and mazes of roads and foresty paths to explore it (yay goal-oriented behavior).Hiking up to Mont Royal's entrance on Rue Peel sucks. It's like a 40 degree incline; don't know how the McGill kids stand it. But once you enter the park, that peaceful feeling settles in. The stairs are staggered so it doesn't feel too bad.Reserve 2-3 hours of your day to visit Mont Royal. All the signs on paths inside are useless, so leave yourself some time to get lost. If you're visiting during daytime, the autumn leaves are BEAUTIFUL. If you're visiting close to evening - bring flashlights! There are barely any lights the higher up you go, and absolute darkness follows soon after dusk. We saw several intrepid Montrealers wearing headlights. Note that there isn't anything on the ""summit"" proper - you'll catch several lovely views of Montreal going up, but on the true summit there's nothing but a radio tower, plus a crown of trees obstructing any view outward.For some reason, just below the summit, there's a gigantic lit-up Broadway-esque Christian cross, straight out of a sci-fi-horror film. It was terrifying."
"I saw a large hill and wanted to climb it. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. I saw a group of Canadian guys who dressed with urban fashion sense. They were the closest to me, so I walked up to ask directions to the top of the hill. As I approached the group and made eye contact with the assumed ring leader or head dealer in charge, I made eye contact. He tossed a lighter at me and it landed by my feet. I made a straight line toward him and asked what he was trying to prove. To quote Mobb Deep, he was a shook one. There was one of me and around 4 of them. Odds were against me although I would have put a hurting on at least one of them which would have been more than worth the ass whooping. He figured that I was not concerned with his minor act of intimidation. He tried to speak French. I explained that I am from America and don't speak that language. He goes ""You want weed?"" and I told him I don't need his bogus herb, just directions. He provided them. I still regret not punching him in the nose."
"We almost wimped out and didn't finish the hike up the hill...so glad we decided to forge on! If you take the winding path, it takes quite a while, but is scenic and easier on the legs than the stairs. (Oy, those stairs...) There are lots of super athletic types running by, but we were content with our hot coffee/tea to sip and stroll. The view at the top/the chateau is quite nice and you can go inside to rest and warm up. No food other than vending machines (the history of the place revealed multiple failed attempts at putting a restaurant there). We were very happy to have spent a half day of our trip on this excursion."
"Great place to spend an afternoon hiking.Four stars because of the lack of signs - we got lost a couple of times trying to reach the chalet and parking lot.Beautiful romantic views of the city. Loved taking in the fresh air, people watching and walking the trails."
"Mount Royal was definitely a highlight of my trip to Montreal. It was a relatively easy bike ride from our hotel, and we had no issues finding it. It's a beautiful park, with many trails, open spaces for a nap/picnic, and of course, that amazing view once you reach the top. We opted to take the stairs, but I believe there is at least one other path that will get you there. Now let me warn you, those steps are no joke. NO JOKE. It was the middle of August when we visited, and by the time we made it to the top, I was drenched it sweat. My footwear was also wildly inappropriate for such a hike (I had on Chuck Taylors), and a good running or hiking sneaker would've made the journey much more comfortable, I'm sure. The terrace allows for sweeping, panoramic views of the entire city. It was really beautiful, and made our trek more than worth it. There is a visitor's center where you can sit down for a rest, use the facilities, etc. No air conditioning when we went, so it was still sticky inside. There are also vendors selling drinks and ice cream if you need to replenish your energy stores before the much easier walk down the hill.Mont Royal was recommended as a ""must see"" while in Montreal, and after experiencing it, I would agree. Just make sure to wear comfortable footwear, bring water, and be ready for a workout."
Came here during a cold day. There were barely any people around the top so it was nice and peaceful with the open space. Had heard that it gets super crowed during the hotter days. We warmed up inside the building behind the Terrance overlook. It's def worth the visit.
"It doesn't matter how touristy this place can be, though its much more than a tourist destination. If you plan a trip to Montreal without going to Mont Royal and especially if you're a park lover, you'll be doing yourself an injustice. Mont-Royal is much more than just a tourist destination with an awesome view of the city of Montreal. It's an oasis within the city. Once you make your trek onto the mountain park, you'll slowly hear the sounds of the city dissipate and transition into serenity and tranquility. You can take the main road and traverse the park or you can take the off beaten paths and really get lost and see where it will lead. It's a huge park and there's so much to explore, nature to witness and a workout to get in.I wish I can write an enticing, majestic, poetic review but I'm not really good at it. Believe me, come here if you're in Montreal and just get lost. Enjoy the lake, enjoy the cemetery, enjoy climbing up the steep paths of the mountain park, bike ride, ride, jog. Come for Tams Tams, people watching, picnic, sports.This park has joined my ranks of favorite parks so far along with Central Park, Gantry State Park and Prospect Park and I'm sure you'll fall in love with it to."
"One of the things that makes Montr√©al one of the world's great cities, this massive park rises high above the city and offers a wide variety of running/walking/biking trails. Dog-friendly as well. All covered in dense forest with excellent shade. Getting up to the very top involves a hefty amount of stairs, but the final view of the city is spectacular at the Chalet du Mont Royal, which has some indoor and outdoor seating if you are exhausted. The park also includes a lake, ice skating rink, cemetery, and other scenic outlooks. Really great exercise and fun mix of tourists and locals."
One of my highlights in montrealIt's free and it's not so far from downtown And the view are just simply amazing. And you can go around the park by walking or running where I see lotsa runners go around the park in a nice weather Some of ice hadn't melted yet so be careful if you are going in the next couple of days
"It's a cute park and it's very big. Getting here was definitely a journey. If you're like me and you're used to the grid like streets in manhattan, ny where you can basically navigate yourself around without a map...you're gonna have a hell of a journey getting here like I did. First of all get a street map of Montreal, I dunno buy it at Barnes and nobles or just download it somewhere. You're gonna be whipping this baby out often just to get around Montreal. Secondly I don't know how other people will get to this park...we had a car so we were fine...I guess another way is public transportation. It's a huge park with 2 cemeteries inside and a pond and 2-3 lookout points. I'm not very sure. Anyway it's a nice place to relax...take a nap from all that walking/driving and take in the sites of the whole city at the lookout points."
"Getting lost in the woods in an urban setting is rare. Even giant parks like Golden Gate Park and Central Park don't quite take you completely out of the city. It's there. You see it if you look up. This park, however, is the immersion of country into city.A few steps into the park and you may lose the sounds of the city entirely. A few more and you'll lose the sights of the city. Take one of many smaller paths (shortcuts to the viewpoint) and you'll lose most other people. Surrounding you will be trees and wildlife. Stop and listen. That silence? Oh, that's just nature, you know, doing its thang. Love it."
"Summary: Beautiful way to see city day/night; best in AutumnMont Royal probably has the best view of Montreal at night.It was a comfortable 15 min walk from our hotel (Omni @ Peel). We went up at dusk using the stairs and pathways that cut up the 'mountain'. This took less than 15min. I was able to do it even though I use a cane and am tired at the end of the day.We would highly recommend taking a flashlight with you for your way in the dark - most hotels will lend one out to you if your cell phone light is insufficient.When we got up to the top we saw many people there, some of whom had driven to same lookout view at the top.There were people there even very late at night so my friend and I (both women) thought it was very safe.I regret that we didn't skip one of the other sights to walk it during the daytime or at sun rise/set when we could see the trees in all their glory."
"One of my favourite spot in mtl. For a nice run, to take ¬†a walk, to have a picnic, to skate, cross country skiing or sliding. Nature in the heart of mtl. Being a country girl I need that one o recharge:)"
Ok so no one tells you that it is a very tiresome hike up those stairs. It's about 30+ flights up. From downtown area I was able to walk up a hill about ten mins to the park entrance. Then it was about another 25 min walk up the stairs. I had no idea or would have worn sneakers and light clothing bc you do get tired and hot very fast. I took multiple breaks on those stairs! However when you get to the top the view is well worth it. There is a terrace area that has gorgeous views of the city. There's also some seating and greenery so you can sit down and people watch. Inside the little house thingy there are bathrooms and souvenir shops. There is a small shop that sells very good lemonade. I wanted water but they don't sell it and the vending machine would've cost me 4$ for a small bottle so I got some lemonades instead for 2$ and it was well worth it. Also I wish they had more signage with where to go. There were no signs until about halfway up the stairs. Luckily I followed some other tourists bc my internet also went out in this area and was ableTo walk in the right direction. Overall a very nice place to spend the afternoon. I imagine it's a lot lot nicer when it's sunset time.
"Wonderful view and amazing walk up to the top. Would definitely recommend it for tourists or even locals. It's iconic, a Montreal classic and it's beautiful at the top. You can take the stairs or the longer, more winding paths up to the top - would recommend the latter for more scenery, the former for a more efficient exercise. Do keep in mind though that the Chateau up at the top and the trails do get busy especially in the summer months when weather gets nicer."
"Truly one of the best places to be in Montreal. You can find artists, family places, there is a lake with, in my opinion, the optimal balance between nature and human modifications.Beautiful views, if you're out of shape and can't climb it from Guy-Concordia metro, there is the #11 bus that leaves from Metro Mont-Royal and there is also a parking lot for your cars.The only ""store"" you'll find for food are vending machines and ice cream trailers so pack a lunch and a bottle of water! Water fountains available in common areas as well.Great place to relax, walk and mountain bike! Recommended for some solo walk for some fresh air and family time! Amazing place! All that's missing is swings and slides :'("
"J'aime le Parc du Mont-Royal! This has got to be my favorite place in Montreal, and gazing upon the skyscrapers and bridges was definitely the highlight of my trip. No wonder this city was named after this mountain!My friend and I took the Metro to the Mont Royal stop and caught the 11 (Montagne) ¬†bus that went up the mountain. After walking on the trail for a few minutes, we found ourselves in front of le Chalet du Mont-Royal where the view was, put simply, spectacular. You definitely do not want to be without a camera with a view like this. Forget buying postcards- just sent a few pics back home!Even if there weren't any sort of view, the lush greenery, clean air, and jogger-friendly trails make Mont Royal a park worth visiting over and over again- for locals and tourists alikeNote to bucket list: stop by at night with a friend, camera and tripod!"
I really wished I had my nikes and sweats coming here! We arrived on bus and upon entering the park it was very breathtaking. Loving all the green and seeing a lot of people running and biking! We took several pictures overlooking Montreal and it was really beautiful. Pictures can not do justice on the view! I would definitely come back here if I ever visit Montreal again. It was a memorable experience.
"I highly recommend coming to this place if you're new to Montreal, visiting of have lived here forever.Its nice in the summer, relaxing and the view when you get on top of the mountain is fantastic! You see all of downtown Montreal and even more. Try spotting some popular landmarks like ""Concordia University"" or ""Old Montreal"" - because you can totally see them from way up there!The walk up is done through stairs and can become a bit tiring so just bring some water. There is a water fountain at the top, though.They also sell popsicles and some ice cream when you get to the top *you can also get to the top by car, but the walk up is nice as it feels like you're in a different place far away from the city, which I enjoy*"
"Beautiful and lots of fun!!! Great for the whole family - just be prepared to get a bit of a work out! Lots of fun for walking, sight seeing, cross country skiing and taking photos! The chalet has bathrooms, chairs, a small fire and vending machines."
"Montrealers are very proud of the fact that their major city park, Mont-Royal, was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the mastermind behind NYC's Central Park. But note that the Canadian park came nearly 25 years later; I'm pretty sure that between those two major commissions, Olmstead had a stroke and forgot everything he knew about park design. If you're used to the whimsies and surprises of Central Park - ponds, glades, fields, forests, fountains, ornamental bridges, and stone-lined footpaths - you'd never recognize the same hand at work here. Instead, Mont-Royal is mainly a series of semi-paved tracks through the woods, with little thought for vistas or variety. If you're a local, this makes for excellent jogging or cross-country skiing (and there are plenty of buff bodies along the trails to prove it). But for tourists on a time budget, the only real reason to climb the ""mountain"" is the excellent view from the broad terrace of Chalet du Mont-Royal. Five minutes snapping pictures, and you're basically done."
"My hubs and I had a lovely week long vacation over the summer in Montreal. Upon telling our family that we were going we received advice on which sights were must sees and which could be avoided. This was on the must see list.  ¬† After walking around the city and meeting some awesome locals we ended up staying up all night drinking in our rental. Our newly made pal left around sunrise and my hubs and I weren't quite ready to hit the hay, so we grabbed a bagel from the shop down the block to help sober us up. After our bagel we decided to talk a walk to the park. Camera in hand we set off. We walked from our rental stopping for another cup of coffee on the way. ¬† ¬† We got to the park and expected it to be a breeze to get to the top. I could not have been more wrong, especially after drinking all night. Anyhow, we hiked to the top, and let me tell you it was totally worth the trek. I did get a lot of interesting looks going up the mountain in jeans, with my camera and a cup of coffee.  ¬† Once at the top, we were rewarded with sweeping views of the city. This is the perfect place to capture some of the best panoramas of the city below. As well as snap a few snapshots of the hubs and I that will be framed and put on the mantle.  ¬† If I lived anywhere near here I'd be spending a lot more time there, lounging on the grass, basking in the sunlight."
"I love this park! It's a great place if you're looking for a good workout (power walk, run, cycle) or if you just want to go for a leisurely walk and feel like you're outside the city. If you head towards le chalet du Mont-Royal, then you will be able to tke advantage of their great lookout, which offers beautiful views of the city. There is also another fantastic lookout (the view is much broader, I think) but I've only ever been there by car, so I'm not sure if it's accessible on foot. ¬†The length of your workout or walk will depend on where you start - there are a few entry points, including the base of the mountain (I forget if that's on Berri...?) and via Duluth, Peel etc. Suggestion: Keep an eye out for cyclists to avoid being run over :)"
Mount Royal is on the top of the lists of what a tourist should do in Montreal so I had to check it out. We initially had a hard time figuring out where to go because the Gps kept taking us to a cemetery. We drove around a lot until we figured out the parking and everything. Someone was extremely nice and gave us their parking pass. This started out our time at Mount Royal on a great note. We walked for about an hour in the area that has a pretty little lake. It was a very pleasant park. On our way out we drove by the lookout area that has a view of Montreal. I definitely recommend checking it out to tourists. They allow dogs so that's a plus.
"Montreal is my favorite city in North America. ¬†If I knew french and found a job there I would be there in a sec. ¬†I try to make it out to this park whenever I come to Montreal, especially on Sundays when they have the tam tams (basically a a huge drum circle).Seeing people from ALL walks of life hanging, drinking, smoking, playing or ¬†just celebrating life in one beautiful circle really embodies the vibe I get from the this city."
"We didn't get to hike the actual mountain because 1) we are lazy and 2) we saw a bunch of cars parked near a ledge overlooking the city.From that standpoint, the view was beautiful! You could see as far as the biodome and biosphere, and just tons of lucious greenery around us.Note - please do NOT feed the obese raccoon here :( He is freaking huge and probably has rabies and will kill you. I saw a ton of people feeding the raccoon straight up BUTTER from a plastic knife...and then I saw a little boy trying to hand the raccoon a cookie FROM HIS HANDS. Are you cray, little boy?! Where your parents at?! At least he got scared and dropped it before the raccoon got to him. Sigh, SMH.A+ view though! =D"
"If you really want to see a great view of the city, I suggest you come here. There's a few different trails and definitely worth running or biking up. Nice and calm mornings but at night it can get a bit messy with kids coming up with their booze."
View- Amazing both day and nightAtmosphere Day- Great view of the city- Mechanical binoculars were convenient to look in the distance- Good for kidsAtmosphere Night- Great view of the night life from a distance- Not good for kids because there are many raccoons being pestered by teenagers making them stick around- Line of up cars just waiting for others to leave to take their parking causing a back log of cars on the street- Great place if you want to get high for free (this is sarcasm)- Could be scary for little kids because of all the teenagers hanging out
Pretty much awesome experience. Of course it happened to be hot as balls the day we decided to go and take our two little ones with us. So much fun pushing strollers and wearing babies up up up up hill in the blistering heat and sun . Will come back another day !
"Mont-Royal park is one of my happy places. Rain or shine, hot and muggy weather or below zero temps, you'll find me going for a walk on the mountain. Out of town visitors will ask what the draw is .... it is the mountain itself. No gimmicks, just lots of nature, a few lookouts and Beaver lake. Us Montrealers are extremely lucky to have such a large green space in the middle of the city, ""the lungs of the city"" as Olmsted referred to his parks. My favourite thing to do is put on sturdy hiking shoes, fill up my water bottle and grab a snack, and head out on a couple of hours of wandering. I much prefer the smaller paths to the main Olmsted Road, wiggling my way across the mountain, occasionally popping out in more populated areas like the belvedere and Beaver lake. ¬†The views are beautiful, and I get a thrill finding my apartment nestled in amongst the other buildings.In the winter the smaller paths can be quite treacherous, but the larger ones remain quite nice thanks to the many people who walk, run, job and bike them year round, plus all of those who cross-country ski and snowshoe. ¬†The refrigerated rink at Beaver Lake is great, as it doesn't matter what the weather is like, the ice is always nice."
"This park is huge -- it's Montr√©al's equivalent of Central Park in NYC or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. ¬†There are massive open spaces and wide, groomed-dirt trails for people to walk, bike, or jog. ¬†If you take the trails all the way up to the top, there's a huge empty building that looks like it could host giant receptions and galas, with a large patio with a great view of the city.There's a giant pond with paddleboats in the summer, and ice skating in the winter! ¬†Plenty of picnic areas, too. ¬†It's definitely a great spot to check out if you are in Montr√©al. ¬†Especially since the park is FREE! ¬†(parking costs money, though).OHMIGOD - I just realized that the entire city of Montr√©al is named after this place!!"
"I was pretty much told that we were going to Parc du Mont-Royal by my boyfriend while we were in Montreal. I had no desire to go since I thought it was just a hill.Driving up to the park, it was pretty scenic with trees, bicyclists just everywhere. More than half way up, there was an overlook where you can see the buildings of downtown Montreal. I thought it was so neat I wanted to stop and take a look, but we kept driving up even further.Holy. Cow. The view left me breathless. So amazing seeing the whole city from this one point. ¬†I am so glad I was able to experience this on my trip to Montreal.Very neat place. Can be very romantic if there weren't many people around. There was a visitor who was playing this random piano that was just placed there."
"Wonderful! ¬†So refreshing to get out & into nature in the middle of the city. ¬†We loved the walk on the trails and barely saw any other people--so quiet & peaceful. ¬†Our kids' feet got chilly, so it was nice to warm up by the fire at the chalet. ¬†This nice public space was also a good place to use the restrooms and take photos of both the building and the view. ¬†Their gift shop was straightforward and very well-curated.I'd love to explore this area more in the summer; it's probably so pretty."
Beautiful park. ¬†Finding parking was a challenge. ¬†Be sure to allow extra time to find nearly parking ¬†and the associated walk before you actually get to the park itself. ¬†All else once at the park was wonderful.
"Pros: View of Montreal and outskirts, nice park before getting to look offCons: Paying for parkingSeeing this was our first trip to Montreal we decided to see it all from a distance. If you're looking at getting a birds eye view of downtown Montreal (for free/cheap) this is the way to do it. There is a lot of parking, however be prepared to dish out a few bucks for it. There are several pay stations where you pay for a certain amount of time and put the receipt on your dash.You first come to the park. There seem to be an assortment of trails you can take, although we hardly explored any. There are several sculptures and pond in the park, in addition to a lodge style building - it was closed since we arrived early in the morning, so I'm not sure its function.There were signs to lead you to the view point, but we didn't see anything that directed us from the parking lot, so keep that in mind - you may need to walk around a bit if you're unfamiliar with the park layout. Once you get to the top you will be pleased with the view. Its an incredible sight to see all of Montreal from one spot. You can see the entire city, the river and a few smaller mountains in the background (looking towards Vermont). I would say this is a great spot to visit when going to Montreal. I gave it a ""average score"" because it was just that. It wasn't terrible - I would say still visit, but don't plan to be ""wow'd"" by any means."
"Absolutely awesome! ¬†The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they could use some food and beverage vendors at the chalets and, also, they could use a pay app that had gps for all of there different trails. Tourists for sure would purchase since we, and others we encountered, were lost and google maps didn't help. If you knew where you were going and you could track your distance (for training purposes) this park would be better than central park, NY. It definitely has the potential; I hope the next time we visit there are improvements. What an incredible park in such an already beautiful city."
The place is nice. We went during the winter so it was underwhelming and not paved at all (must bring snow shows) but once you get to the top the view is very nice and the satisfaction of having climbed the mountain is wonderful. Don't expect a paved and nice easy walk if it's winter/snow is outside. Im not complaining though I liked the rugged trip. Just prepare.
"How can anybody give this gorgeous urban oasis, the Grand Dame of Montreal, less than a 5-star rating???? It's incomprehensible to me!!!As a kids, my grandparents came to this park, centrally located in the heart of the city, yet feeling worlds away from the hustle and bustle of city life. My father grew up near here and visited the mountain here a gazillion times. As a child, I was taken here every winter to skate on Beaver Lake (which was iced over each winter) and us kids tobogganed down the gentle slopes by the Lac des Castors, stopping only for hot cocoa we got in the adjacent chalet. As a teenager and young adult, I spent whole summers here, suntanning on the slopes with my friends, having picnics, playing our guitars, tossing frisbee and listening to the radio (yes, we were frustrated hippies! Lol). The hilly slopes were packed with fellow sunbathers and families and couples, just relaxing and taking in the warm weather and the gorgeous surrounding greenery. I hear the mountain is still bustling in the summer!The lower mountain contains Beaver Lake, the large chalet and miles and miles of pathways and trails, paved and not, big and small. There are a gazillion squirrels and ducks (and there used to be swans, too, but I haven't seen them the last few times I visited). There's a playground/park area off the lake that has been renovated and updated sometime in the past 5 years or so. It's amazing! There are 2 climbing rocks and a small ground-mounted water feature and lots of contemporary play equipment. Even my two teen kids loved these new playground features! And I loved seeing all the young tots and families laughing and playing; there were French and English families, orthodox Jewish families, and I heard other languages spoken that I could not place. It was great. Everything a city park should be.The upper mountain (which is connected to the lower mountain by way of a gazillion paths and trails) is comprised of a grand stone chalet (I think it's called the Smith House) and the most popular lookout of the entire city, with a vista of McGill and the downtown skyline. You know the photo of downtown Montreal you see on 90% of postcards? That's taken at this observation lookout. It's a spectacular view, day or night. Further up the mountain, on trails and paths, big and small, are a tall, ¬†on-descript radio or cell tower, a radio CBC building, and then the piece du resistance, the glorious cross of Montreal (croix de Mont Royal). I laughed when I read the reviewer say that the cross was creepy and she didn't know why it was there. In 1643, the founder of Montreal, de Maisonneuve, erected the first cross on this site. As long as I can remember, and as long as my father can remember, there's always been a cross here on the mountain, which is illuminated each night. I remember studying late in the McGill library in the early 80's and seeing the cross light up at night. It's not creepy; it's an integral part of the City's history.Anyhow, Mont Royal is a glorious oasis. It's beloved by bikers, jogger's, strollers, dog walkers (man, I used to walk my dog Maggie here a lot in the 90s! She adored ¬†exploring all the narrow trails through the woods), families and ALL Montrealers. Interns and doctors on break come here from the Montreal General for a brief respite, to de-stress. Mommy groups come here. Couples snuggle on benches. The young and old come here. This is our Central Park - and, I know I'm biased, but I prefer it to Central Park, as the views of the city cannot be beat. And it's safe. And clean.  The mountain is stunning in fall, with the explosion of colors in the foliage. It's serenely beautiful in the winter with the glistening snow and ice-crystalled trees. It's fresh and crisp in the spring with the scents of grass and the colors of flowers emerging. And the greenery of summer and the warmth of the air is wonderful. My only gripe is the parking. It used to be free. Now they've revamped the lots, so there seems to be way more parking spots (always a good thing!), but it costs so much to park ($3/hour), even when the park is near empty on cool and rainy days. I remember spending whole days here, with my pals in the summer, and it cost nothing. I think the park was more frequented and enjoyed then."
My wife and I and two friends drove up to Montreal for a quick 3 day vacation before moving onto Quebec City. We stayed at an Airbnb place near Mount Royal so we had to check it out. It's a great park with several hiking options (from stairs to paths). No need to go all the way to the top as the lodge level has a GREAT view of the city and free wifi in the lodge.
Such a beautiful walk and has great views of the city. Well kept enough for a jogging stroller. Perfect way to spend a weekend morning!
Great for inexpensive activities. ¬† ¬† ¬†We had a lot of fun. ¬†Line took forever to rent for skiing.
I have been coming here my whole life and absolutely love this place. ¬†I think the lookout is one of my favourite spots in Montreal with its views of the downtown skyline. ¬†On a beautiful day it is a great spot to enjoy a picnic or go for a run. ¬†Even in winter it is worth coming to if you like skating or cross country skiing.
"If you want the easiest way to get up Mont Royal, get on Peel Street. There's a LOT of stairs to the top. There's several walking paths in which people are usually exercising. There's some statues on the ground level. Once you get to the top, there is an ice pop cart off to the right(I think). There's a large area where you can take pictures, but the only place you can sit outside is right in front of the building, and if it's sunny, the sun will definitely be on you. Inside, there are interesting squirrels in the eaves. There is a gift shop and some seating. There's a vending machine, but if you want plain water, you have to go downstairs, where there are restrooms. It's generally creepy in the basement, though. It's fun (going down) and you will be glad you went."
"Beautiful Park.The lookout point in absolutely fantastic! Beware if you travel there in the colder months, we had a walk up the hill filled with ice and snow."
"In case you're feeling a little adventurous, I just want to mention something that may not have been mentioned in previous reviews. Once you reach the Chalet du Mont Royal with the large circular viewing area where all the tourists linger around and take photos, that's not the highest you can go. If you're facing the Chalet, keep walking behind it up some stairs and you'll see a park. Instead of going around the park along the paved road, cut straight to back of the park and you'll see some unpaved entry way into what looks like a hiking trail. Keep walking and you'll find yourself in a forest. I stumbled upon it by accident because I didn't want to walk along the pavement and was so glad I did. The locals must all know about it because I saw a couple of people jogging in there with their dogs, but it's a heavenly area to be in if you want to take the road less taken. See pic: yelp.ca/biz_photos/BYnmP‚Ä¶.Once you enter the trail, it'll take you only 15-20 minutes to get to the top. You also have several chances to cut out of the trail and return to the paved road if you want. I may be wrong but once I reached the top, there was no view, but the trail itself is worth checking out."
"Nice park. Clean, perfect kids, or if you wan to ride your bike or simply to take a long walk."
This place is awesome - you get to go up to the highest point in Montreal and see the best viewThere are racoons up top waiting to bed fed which is quite amusing
"I was lucky enough to be there on a Sunday when thousands of people get together, play drums, chill and enjoy the life. This place is a must have for all the cities in the world.Best time to check out is Sunday afternoon if the weather is nice. Bring a djembe or a drum of your choice to jam along."
"The ""Lookout Point"" was literally amazing!!! You could see the entire city!!! The view was incredible!! It was a little cold when we went so make sure you dress accordingly. Met one of my high school buddies there so it was also very surreal to be there with great friends from the past. YOLO!!!"
"If you need some fresh air and a little exercise, then a walk up Mont-Royal is a great way to spend an hour or two. During my April visit there were still patches of snow and squirrels on the walk up and my friend and I loved the stillness that this little pocket of natural Montreal brought us. Well worth the visit."
"Great park! ¬†We went twice, once at night. ¬†We couldn't stand the teenagers with their weed smoking and their bad francophone pop/rap/thumping music in their Mitsubishis. Also, prostitutes hook at Mont-Royal overlook at night.During the day it was beautiful and well worth the drive."
"Oh the great Mont-Royal, standing tall over the beautiful city of Montreal. The views atop is breath-taking. There are several vista points with great views, and you can find the usual crowd of tourists there. If you're feeling adventurous, there are also many little corners and paths, each with its own character and beauty. The suggested way to get up to the top is hiking or running. Mont-Royal has one of the best running paths I've ever been on, and you'll see your fair share of runners on any given day. If for whatever reason you can't hike or run up, there's also a road (and bus) in the back that you can use to drive up to the vista points. If you're lucky enough to be in Montreal throughout the seasons, you'll be able to catch the astonishing annual lifecycle of the mountain from here - from the budding greens of spring, to the overflowing life in summer, to the fiery leafs of fall, to the snowy calm of winter. Astonishing."
"Stair Master!Mont Royal is a really nice park with wide trails and great views. You can hike to the top relatively quickly if you take the stairs... a must see stop for tourists. Don't be discouraged by the mountain, it's really not that bad. There's even a big building at the top with bathrooms, banquet hall, and store.Tips: Stretch before hitting those steps!"
"Gorgeous Park in Montreal. Make sure you have the correct one if you decide to take an Uber there as the app seems to have another Parc du Mont royal in its database that is much smaller and the wrong one. We took the walk up the road to the summit, but the really breathtaking views are at the chalet a km or so down the road from the top. It was a nice place to go hiking as I spotted several trails that wound through the trees. If you like nature and the outdoors, you should visit here. Casuals can stick to the road, while adventurers can check out the trails"
"I can't believe it took 3 visits to Montreal for me to actually go here - - don't make the same mistake! Lovely park - super spread out, with enough peaks to get a day's worth of exercise in - if strenuous hiking and sweating it up is yr thing. There's also some great views near the visitor center. Apparently the park has 5 peaks, but we kind of just showed up without doing any research/acquiring maps so we only made three. Still - not that upset, half a day well spent. Oh - worth noting - bring your own water / snacks!"
"(score 1-100) -91. ¬†Amazing HUGE park in the heart of Montreal. ¬†You need to reserve a couple of hours (2 to rush, 3 to see everything) in your day to fully enjoy the park. ¬†Locals use it to jog, bicycle, frisbee or picnic or whatever on a summer day. ¬†It has a little bit of everything. ¬†There is a Japanese Garden, a giant pond with water lilies and frogs, a dinosaur park (man made statutes not the kind you find in the Fields Museum in Chicago or Smithsonian). ¬†You can get here by metro and or by car. ¬†It is free and one of the top 10 things to do in Montreal."
"This is such a large park and not only does it offer green grass for picnickers, dog walkers and sun worshipers, it also provides terrain for those who want a hike, run or bike ride.We decided to walk the park and didn't really plan on walking to the top, but the more we walked, the more we reasoned that we were just getting closer to the top so we finally decided to just make that our goal.The walk to the top took us about an hour. The terrain is gravel and it's quite shady. The way to the top is by long switchbacks up the mountain and then a long set of stairs to the top. Once you reach the top, you're rewarded with a view of Montreal (on a clear day) and there's plenty of steps and chairs to sit and rest.For our way down, we saw a short cut which basically when straight down the mountain via steps. It spit us out behind McGill University so if you don't want to take the long route up (what we did), you can take the short cut (the stairs) and just head straight up to the lookout area.A fabulous park and nice escape from the city."
"Doubting my ability to bear the 10 degree weather for an extended period of time, I carefully bundled myself in about 8 layers of clothes and embarked on my quest up the mountain. Only to realize that in hiking up a mountain, one becomes quite toasty, and thus it's fairly unnecessary to wear every sweater and coat you own. ¬†I've only been during the winter, but it was an amazing hike with ridiculously rewarding views at the top. Except for the red ""s"" that is so prominent from almost every viewpoint (see pics). Really though, it's a winter wonderland.Super fun to slip and slide down the closed staircases. I'm pretty sure the whole park would be closed in the US for fear of crazy lawsuits. Props to Canada for keeping it open and trusting people to use decent judgment. Or, if you're like me, use poor judgment but blame it on yourself if anything bad happens. Can't wait to return this summer and see how it is when it's warm outside."
"A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic. ¬†Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city. ¬†This place is worth the visit."
"Ah, Parc du Mont-Royal -- c'est magnifique!Who doesn't like getting lost in an enchanted forest? A forest inhabited by runners, families, couples, in-line skaters, bikers, children... and squirrels. Lots of squirrels. Really though, if you're entering from Ave. des Pins & Rue Peel, head off the paved Chemin Olmsted as you head up, up and up (but don't take the main staircase that leads up) ... and before you know it, you will be lost (true story)! But have no fear, before you realize it (well actually, after a fair amount of hiking) you will find yourself at le Chalet du Mont-Royal. Step down to the front terrace area and take in the view of the city, turn around and take in the Chalet, and ... exhale."
"Spectacular view from the top of Mount Royal - would not recommend walking up / hiking if you are not in good shape : truly a difficult trail for those that are not used to hiking. ¬†Instead, take a care ride up to the lookout - biggest challenge will be the wait for parking, but well worth the wait. ¬†Truly enjoyable location."
"Best view in the city, all year round. good for jogging / cross-country skiing."
It took a long time to walk to the top but it was very nice and had a great view of the city. It is a good way to get exercise and take a break from downtown.
"Took the main carriage road (from the statue) up to the 390 steps (or whatever it is) and then took in the view (nice, but nothing spectacular). ¬†Walked down to the Smith Maison and ate outdoors. ¬†Best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had in my life. ¬†Walked down to the lake. ¬†And then took the bus back to the Mont-Royal Metro. ¬†All in all, a lovely afternoon!"
"if it's your first time to Montreal, I feel it's kinda required to go up Mont Royal. however, my first visit a few years back was in the dead of winter and it was well below freezing, so it wasn't as enjoyable as when I made a return trip this summer.that being said, this is a wonderful park, partially designed by the same guy (Olmsted) who is responsible for Central Park. it is very well-maintained, and the views out over downtown Montreal are majestic. in the summertime, it's wonderfully green.the Chalet building offers restrooms, vending machines, seating for your sore legs, and even a small souvenir shop. some cool artwork inside the huge main room which also hosts large events. in the winter, it's (relatively) warm inside, perfect for when you want to run out to snap some photos then run back inside before frostbite strikes.even once you reach the Chalet, there are further trails/paths to walk up. at night, the giant cross of Mont Royal lights up.getting here is easy. if you've got a lot of time, you can walk/hike (either trails or the slope along the roads). we saw some people running and biking. the time-efficient method though is to take one of the buses. the #11 is your best bet, and if you happen to miss the handful of stops on the mountain proper, don't worry - it loops through some residential neighborhood and comes right back. note that you've still got a nice walk up to the vantage point from the bus stops! BEAST MODE!long story short: pack a water bottle and a camera. it's worth the time and effort. plus you'll burn off some calories from all the poutine you've been eating!"
"Smack-dab in the middle of downtown Montreal, Mont-Royal park is a gem in this lovely city. ¬†You can enter the park through multiple routes around the park. ¬†Do not get discouraged by the trek, it is a gradual incline. ¬†It takes about 45 mins at an easy pace. ¬†Be sure to bring your camera, the view at the top is stunning!The chalet at the top has washrooms and vendor machines; plus there is seating inside.I would definitely recommend the hike up to Mont Royal! ¬†You can take the stairs down for a quick descent."
Beautiful! Definitely worth the drive and the hike up. Epic view of the entire city. Just be careful in the winter - the walk pathways get super icy. I imagine this would be a great place to run when it's warmer out.
"Mont royal is a lovely park right in the middle of Montreal. ¬†My boyfriend and I went in early July and the weather was perfect. ¬† When you're at the top, you can see the whole city. ¬†But the good part (for me) was the walking up to the top - not so much the view! ¬†Before we went, we read a lot of reviews about the hike and how it would take hours to walk it, that ¬†the stairs are horrible and to take the bus etc. ¬†After having done it, I can honestly say that IT""S NOT THAT BAD! ¬†We started at Stanley Ave (I think - one of the streets by McGill) and Pine. ¬†We walked along the path and looped it up. ¬†We weren't walking fast and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the summit. ¬†We're also not speed walkers or in great shape. ¬†It was just a leisurely pace. We took the stairs down and once we realized how short they were, we actually went back up on the stairs! ¬†It took like 10 minutes and that was just going an average pace! ¬†Seriously - THE STAIRS ARE NOT THAT BAD!!!Hope this helps to put others at ease! ¬†Wendy"
"How can one give less than 5 stars to Montreal's ""balcony?"" Whether full on a warm summer day or sparsely populated during fall colors, this is a must-see and provides breathtaking vistas of Montreal. ¬†Your photos will please you. ¬†Just about everything is seen from here, and only for inserting some loons at a parking meter, from which everything is close. ¬†One can also see the Lac aux Castors, the cross of Maisonneuve, and the Chalet at the Belvedere itself, along with the elevated vantage point putting you above or at eye-to-eye level with the best of the Montreal skyline. ¬†Cloaked in fall colors, it is off the Richter scale in terms of beauty and charm."
"Nice public park offering beautiful views of the city. But make sure to go on a sunny day, otherwise you won't see anything.During the winter, there is a free skating rink (skate rentals are also available) and public snow tubing lanes.Parking is $2.75 CAD per hour or $8.00 for the day."
Great way to spend a morning. ¬†Getting lost in this metropolitan park was lots of fun. ¬†The trail systems is not well marked bit all roads lead to the same place. ¬†I encourage you to go off the main road and into the wooded area. ¬†Great city hiking after a night of Montreal cuisine.
"A trip up this mountain is essential if you are in Montreal. ¬†It is not a terribly difficult hike, but you will get a decent work out. ¬†When you are close to the top, you can take a short cut in the form of stairs. ¬†The real pay off is at the top of the mountain where you will have a very picturesque view of the city.Even if you do not care to hike, just spending time in the park would make for a peaceful morning or afternoon. ¬†The park is beautiful."
"This was one of the best spots I went to when visiting Montr√©al. Its a pretty good hike and then a tonn of stairs but its so worth it when you get to the top. At the top there is the Chalet du Mont Royale. Which is a building with beautiful architecture, gift shop, vending machines, and bathrooms. Outside there is a huge granite overlook where you can see all of Montr√©al and take pictures. Its a must see if visiting for the first time! There is also graveyards but I didnt get a chance to check those out."
I hiked up Mount Royal on the first day of my stay in Montreal. It was a great introduction to the city! Beautiful sights and my San Diego friends loved playing in the snow.I recommend taking the path all the way up and then using the stairs shortcut coming back down! Thats what our group did and it seemed to work out nicely.
"How can you not rate this 5 stars?? When you get to the lookout and you have a gander over downtown, wow....what an amazing view!!The parc on the other side was perfect for a picnic lunch overlooking the duck pond. It was really great to see everyone enjoying the perfect summer weather we were having. ¬†I can image how beautiful all of this must be in the frosty cold Montreal winters which I still have yet to experience!"
"Be sure to park at the parking lot near the ""belvedere,"" which is a short walk to the lookout point. A great spot to take pics. If you only want to check out the lookout point, 45 min parking is enough."
"SO WORTH IT! Was in Montreal for a 5 day visit, ¬†The first day, my friend showed me around a lot of places but we didnt walk UP the Mont-Royal. I went back a couple days later and hiked up on my own! I went via Station Mont Royal - stopping off at the cute boutiques/coffee shops along Avenue du Mont Royal. That area is definitely a lot more rustic and interesting compared to downtown. It was soooo beautiful - very easy road/track to walk up - with more challenging vertical climbs if you wish to do so - and as I was there in Autumn, the beautiful colors of the leaves accompanied you the whole way, until you get to the top and see the stunning view overlooking Montreal! Things are clearly signposted and its worth checking out the Chateaux - where the old groundskeeper used to live - and in the basement (where the free toilets are!) is an interesting display of the history etc of the area. Didn't have any food at the Chateaux, but there were plenty of people eating and enjoying a hot drink. The walk down via the steps back into downtown is a nice way to take a look through McGill University too. Definitely a romantic spot - I was feeling a bit lonely and wish I'd at least had a dog to walk or something! But experiencing nature with classical jazz in my ear was pretty nice too."
This is the first time I visited the Park and Montreal is so lucky to have such a wonderful park in its midst. ¬†The climb to the look out point was well worth the walk as the panorama view of the Montreal is spectacular.
"Great view of Montreal, a must stop if you're visiting from out of town. ¬†It's Fall right now, so I'm sure the changing of the leaves is adding to the experience. ¬†If I was a local, I'd be here frequently, enjoying the nature or getting some running in like a lot of the other people seem to be."
"Since coming to Montreal on holiday I have enjoyed walking up Mont Royal on frequent occasions. Whether you like to walk, run or cycle there are plenty of different paths to keep you interested. If you're fit enough to scale the steps there is an amazing view of Montreal from the top. There is also a place to rest, drink and use the bathroom. An exercise venue that merits many return visits"
"Wonderful place to hike up to in the early morning after a nice brunch. ¬†As tourists just there for the day, it was a beautiful view of the whole city that offered a place to take great photos.The hike itself isn't too bad, can be either very direct with stairs or lengthier with a paved path.Certainly a must visit stop for those coming in from out of town."
"the nice way to start to visit the city is always from the top. And Parc du Mont-Royal is the best park anywhere, with the best view ever!"
"So gorgeous. Great for pictures, runners, bikers, picnic, and exercise."
"Just an absolute gorgeous view of the city. ¬†There were a fair few other people who also wanted to take in the view but it didn't feel overly crowded to me. ¬†The park was designed by Frederick Olmstead, who designed Central Park in NYC.A massive green space with trails, park benches, and the occasional water fountain to quench your thirst - I'm looking forward to visiting during different seasons."
"Stunning views.A cool late-summer evening, we get out of our hotel room, and take a hike to Mont Royal. I am not going to go in to the history behind it because that is what the Encyclopedia (or WIkipedia, if you are one of the Wiki fans) is for. It took us about 40 minutes to get to the top. It was an invigorating walk. Definitely wear sneakers. We passed by bicyclists, both leisure and professional. There is a huge viewing area, once you get to the top. You get a beautiful view of the city and the river surrounding it. It makes for an excellent picnic spot. Too bad, we didn't bring any food. We could have had a great dinner on top of the mountain. A definite visit when you are in Montreal.P.S. It is designed by the same guy who designed Central Park in NYC."
Beautiful park with a gorgeous view of the city. The hike up is about 20 minutes and be sure to wear comfortable sneakers! Right now certain places in the city are featuring city pianos where civilians can voluntarily play some tunes on the piano in the middle of the park to the public. It is very enjoyable to watch and listen. The music gives the whole park a magical feel. Definitely worth the hike!
"I'm very glad that I went here on my first full day in Montreal. What a nice park. Some friends that I was staying with took my here, and we took the tourist route up through the snow to the lookout point. It was one of the first nice days in Montreal after a brutal winter, and everyone was out (even in pretty deep snow) to walk or run through the park. I would love to come back in the summer when the weather is nicer. My hosts told me that people come out in droves to play and listen to music, which would be right down my alley."
"Mount Royal has some of the most spectacular views in Montreal itself. You can see for miles and miles. There is a large walking part too, I was suprized by the amount of walkers / hikers and jaywalkers even! It has an observation tower as well as a cemetary. This had some of the best preserved 'green' in Montreal that I saw. I would stropngly recomend anyone visiting to check it out at least once."
Great views of the city and tons of great hiking trails. Make sure to walk to the chalet that overlooks downtown Montreal.
"A hike up to the top of Mont Royal is an experience not to be missed if you're ever in Montreal. ¬†It doesn't take too long, but I would recommend leaving enough time to take a stroll around and take in the beautiful scenery. ¬†I was able to climb up the stairs (this is the shortcut) in about an hour - starting from the bottom of the street (corner of Peel and Maisonneuve). ¬†I stopped a lot along the way, as I wasn't feeling too well that day, so it's probably hike-able in less than an hour if you're full of energy that day. :) ¬†The final 100 steps or so are quite steep and nearly a vertical trek up, so it's something to keep in mind.If you choose to take the leisurely route and stop through other historical spots, it is supposed to take about three hours. ¬†It's also allegedly a lot less steep, as the incline is gradual. ¬†I highly recommend checking out Frommers' ""Walking Tour 3 or 4"", which is a detailed self-guided tour through and up Mont Royal.Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll be at the Chalet du Mont Royal. ¬†It's a breathtaking view of the entire city, and I was lucky to be there on a sunny, but cool day. ¬†Even though it was the tail end of summer, the late afternoon breeze up there was quite chilly for an LA native such as myself! ¬†You can continue past the Chalet, through a gravel-ish road that will lead you to the Croix (the cross atop the mountain). ¬†It takes about 10-15 minutes to get there from the Chalet, but it's a lovely walk through a visual of greenery that is so worth it. ¬†Location is easy to get to, as the uphill trek starts in downtown area (very close to McGill University and the Peel or McGill metro stops). ¬†Do it!"
"Designed by Olmsted, the man who brought you Central Park in New York. ¬†We took the winding path up the hill. ¬†A brief detour through McGill was part of the tour, capped off at the chalet mont-royal. ¬†Great view of the city. ¬†The chalet was sort of a bummer in that it was under- utilized, and could make a ton if $$$ with a cafe in it, but otherwise worth the trip..."
"One of the city's most relaxing and treasured spots and definitely one of my most adored places in Montreal. Whether it's flying kites, a quick jog along the beautiful park, a game of ultimate frisbee, a family picnic, a visit to the Monument to Sir George-√âtienne Cartier and Tam Tams or simply appreciating the beautiful greenspaces in the middle of a vibrant city, Parc du Mont-Royal's got it all. On top of Mont-Royal is the famous Cross placed by Maisonneuve with a magnificent view of downtown Montreal. The Parc also serves as site for many winter activities and annual events such as Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr√©al."
"You're a Sunday Pothead that enjoys African rythms? You're an upcomming athlete training hard and want to run in a safe Envrionment? You're a family with a car but no money to spend looking for a nice place so kids can enjoy a place to run and have a nice pique-nique? You're simply an amateur of Nature? Well Parc Mont-Royal ¬†is the place for you. An extrordinary panorama of Montreal, It's definietly a Must see in Montreal. ¬†For people who's affraid it might look like a place everybody climbs, the local public transportation takes you up there. If you do have a car, there's a lot of Parking too."
"Every Sunday there is a giant drum circle, with dancing hippies and dozens of craft vendors. ¬†The park is huge, but this event, called the Tam Tams (English translation: drum drums, basically), takes place right off Parc avenue cross street Rachel (Rachel doesn't cross Parc at this point, but if it did, it would hit the Tams). ¬†Look for a big monument with a winged angel on the top, and you're there. ¬†You can take the 80 bus from downtown, or you can jump on a BIXI and ride there. ¬†There are two BIXI stands near the Tams, one directly across the street and another at Parc and Mont Royal. ¬†They are often full, but they turn quickly, so just wait it out. ¬†You can get a free 15 minutes if the stand is full, just poke the dispenser machine.The Tams are amazing, and very family friendly, too. ¬†There are dogs, hippies, girls in bikinis, young people, old people, Rastas, acrobats, jugglers.Near the Tams, but further in, away from the road, something absolutely bug-nuts awesome happens. ¬†People gather on a dirt battle field and wallop each other with medieval weapons covered in foam. ¬†Some of them are dressed in pretty impressive battle armor. ¬†They take it very serious, and oh man is it a great thing to watch. ¬†If you've never seen this go down, check it out for sure.So, Sunday on the mountain. ¬†There's no place I'd rather be, full stop."
"A fantastic park in the heart of Montreal - easily walkable from the metro. We walked up a seemingly endless flight of stairs and came to the summit, with gorgeous views of the city and river. After a couple of days in the city, this was a welcome escape into a bit of nature. There's a great open grassy bald at the top, and it was the perfect place to have a lunch time snack before heading back down."
Very pretty park! Hubby and I took a picnic lunch up to enjoy the view. Too bad there are no bixi bike stations at the top! It'd be fun to bike down (but not up!)
"I finally made it to Mount Royal on my most recent visit. ¬†It's not the easiest walk up but there are stairs at some parts of the walk. ¬†I wouldn't recommend this for the elderly or if you have kids in tow. ¬†Once you get to the top, you're treated to the best views of the city. ¬†Plenty of photo opps. ¬†The parc's designer also designed NYC's Central Park."
"This is a must-visit attraction when you're in MTL. Gotta go. Yes, it's touristy. But you HAVE to do it. The views are spectacular. Plain and simple."
"This was so wonderful! It made me wish I lived in Montreal. It was fun climbing the mountain as a tourist and seeing the spectacular views, but I could see it would be a fantastic resource for local runners or cyclists to enjoy daily or weekly. We were there this past weekend so early October and it was an excellent time to see the changing leaves. This is a must see part of Montreal, which I only got to see on my 3rd trip!"
It's Montreal's central park. It's always nice to have a bit of green in a city and that is it. haha just avoid touching the raccoon's. Great place for people to go running in a friendly environment. It's also nice to just take a walk there on long and hot summer nights. There's also THE view of Montreal that everyone knows.
"Parc du Mont-Royal is a nice place to escape for a few hours, or the day. It is what you make of it. You can either take the stairs straight up to the Chateau or you can use the path to wanter around more leisurely and see sights like Beaver Lake, the International statue garden, then the Chateau, cross, etc.There is an information center which sells ice cream, coffee, and snacks near the sculptures. They also have a public rest room and a large grassy area so if you were planning to have a picnic, this is a great spot. Plenty of room for kids (or adults who behave like children) to frolic around and play, have a great view of sculptures, the lake, etc. From this area it is only a short walk (I think it is 0.6km) to the Chateau where you will have a great panoramic view of the city.The day that I ventured to the top of Mont-Royal I was able to see some band shooting a music video, some tourists, some local families, athletes, and photo bugs. Seems like this park has a little something for everyone."
"It is really a good place to go on a date, my ex an I used to go there when we did know what to do just to have a drink an watch montreal, it is supper romantic place, fun and a must do for tourists."
Mount Royal is a must see in good weather. ¬†Probably not the best in the rain as you have to do some walking to get to the top. ¬†When we visited we were impressed with the number of joggers and bikers going up the hill. ¬†The walk up is an easy slope for most folks and appeared to be wheelchair accessible. ¬† The view is fantastic. ¬†Probably even better in the fall or winter when the haze is gone. ¬†They have a large building at the top with restrooms and he like if needed. ¬†One cool thing was that there was a piano just sitting out on the top and random people would go play the piano. ¬†Doesn't take a ton of time to visit unless you want to hang out and enjoy the view.
"Loved it! The view from the top was completely worth the trek through the snow. We kept imagining what it would look like in the Spring, Summer, and Fall and figured that people who lived nearby are completely lucky. We passed by children playing in the snow, cross country skiers, people biking (in the snow!), jogging, etc.The lake was frozen over so there was no boating but some of the other buildings were open and we enjoyed seeing a cute little Lego display of the park by some schoolchildren.Even if nothing else, it's a gorgeous walk and a lovely view. It would be a shame to go to Montreal and not pay this beautiful park a visit."
"Mont-Royal park is designed by the same person that designed Central Park in New York. I used to think that when I went to the park I was ""going to the mountain"" but actually Montreal very much IS the mountain!So the park area is like central park, meaning there it is right in the center in this case on top of (which is very exciting) this amazing warm artistic creative mysterious city. Considering Montreal has the largest underground city in the world it is quite a thrill to go deep down into the underground into the tunnels and such, and then come up to the park on top. Where else can you experience a mountain so intimately from on top, underground, and all around.Take the number 11 bus to to get to Mont Royal park, and be real, it is Mount REAL after all. As well as Mount Royal. Regal AND real :) Nice combination in my books."
Very pretty park and the bike trail going up and down was fun and stress free. ¬†The lookout near the summit was very cool and awesome photo opportunities.
"For those of you familiar with the makeshift drum/rhythm sessions at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza, you'll find an even bigger and more impressive session happening on Sundays at Parc du Mont-Royal, called Tam Tam Jam.Come watch and groove to the beats, or bring a cowbell and partake yourself."
"The first time I made the trek to the top of Mont Royal was in the winter. It involved a lot of walking uphill, walking over some tiny streams (that were still running), walking up some steep rocky bits and some flights of stairs, slipping sometimes, but it was worth it. The view from the top is incredible, you can see much of the city. I went during the nighttime, so I could see all the buildings lit up and could point out some landmarks, such as te Olympic Stadium. The way up may have been more difficult, but the walk back down proved to be much easier. I returned again this spring, and it was a much different experience. It was raining and foggy, but wasn't too chilly or anything. My group took a different route this time. In the winter we had walked up some roads, but this time all we did was take some stairs to walk up (which were the same stairs I took on the way back down during my trek in the winter). Walking up the stairs was lengthy, but again well worth it. Because it was foggy you couldn't see too much of the city, but it was beautiful seeing the rain fall from that high up.If you love nature like myself, it's a pretty amazing hike to take, being surrounded by the trees. It'l become a place for myself to go to for every trip made to one of my favourite cities."
The hike up from the south or east is totally worth it. The view of the city is spectacular. Awesome photo ops. The park is clean and the paths are nice. The chateau at the top is a great place to chill and eat a sack lunch. This is a MUST SEE when visiting Montreal. I have only been in late summer but I am sure all seasons in the park are amazing.
"You can drive here and park easily, but it's really not a big deal to get the bus from the Mont Royal Metro, and there are so many other tourists doing the same you won;t get lost. Another advantage of this method is that you can go back down into the Plateau to stroll or dine after you're done on the Mountain and not worry about parking.The Viewpoint at the Chateau is extraordinary, one of the rare must-dos that really is. the Chateau itself is huge and impressive, there are vending machines and a small gift shop so bring food if you want to do a proper picnic. From here you can stroll down to Lac du Castors (fenced off for construction as of this writing) and the large children's play area nearby."
"This place is a must to visit if you're in Montreal! I went to this mountain during the winter time, and the mountain looked so beautiful! I'm sure this place is wonderful all year around.You can hike up the mountain or drive up. My hubby and I drove up and ended up at Beaver Lake. You can take the stairs up as well, which happened to be opened even during the winter season. ¬†There was a building there beside Beaver Lake where you can rent skis & skates for a small price. Beaver Lake was frozen and many people were ice-skating on it. Kids were enjoying their time tobogganing and many others were having a great time skiing.Up on the mountain, there is a boutique and small cafe in the Smith House. The boutique was nothing special; it was like a store you would find at the zoo. Also, on the top of the mountain you have a breathtaking view of the city below- worth seeing!"
"I have such great memories from this park. ¬†I spent a good part of my youth in Montreal and sadly do not live there now, but try to get up there as often as possible. ¬†My grandparents took me there tobogganing, I went there with friends to hang out and explore. ¬†It is a magical part of Montreal -- from its peak to its base.This is such a wonderful -- and huge (101 hectare or nearly 250 acres) -- park with so much to see and do. ¬†Everything from hiking, biking, skating, skiing, etc. ¬†I have climbed up the mountain and walked all along its trails and never get bored of it.And don't forget about the views from the parking area at the top of the peak -- the BEST views of this wonderful city are here night and day. ¬†You can also start a small hike from here to the lighted cross at the top of the moutain.Oh . . . and for those of you with religous or historical curiousity, there is also the 100+ year old St. Joseph's Oratory where supposedly 1,000's were healed there throughout the years. ¬†There are thousands on crutches on display which are supposed to have come from those who were healed there. ¬†Very moving place to visit -- even if you are not Catholic. ¬†(and shhhhh . . . don't tell anyone, but my cousin and I used to shoot off caps from the top balcony overlooking the parking area.) ¬†And it is gorgeous to look at in the evening when it is all lit up -- I used to love standing in our living room window before going to bed and seeing that lovely church all lit up -- especially in the winter time.To sum it up, there is SO much to do in this oasis of a park which is in the heart of the city. ¬†Montreal would not be the city that is without the beauty of this park. ¬†So no matter what time of year you are there visiting -- or if you are lucky enough to be living there -- don't overlook Mount Royal, as there is something to see and do everywhere you turn. ¬†Or if you don't want to do anything at all, there is so much open space to just sit and relax.There is always something going on there -- much like Central Park in NY -- to check out the happenings at Mount Royal, check them here: lemontroyal.qc.ca/index2‚Ä¶"
Fab park to burn off all the poutine!!! Lots and lots of stairs to climb but worth it for a memorable view of Montreal.They need to improve signage and have trail maps more readily available so women with no sense of direction can avoid getting lost.
"Walking up to the lookout point near the top of Mont Royal was a highlight of our trip to Montreal. The park itself is gorgeous, and was designed by Frederick Olmstead, who also designed NYC's Central Park. In September, it was lush, verdant and filled with just enough people to remind us that we weren't in the middle of the forest -- although we did spot a raccoon hiding in a little hole in the top of a tree!After walking on the path for a few miles (oops, kilometers) and noticing we were slowly gaining altitude, we took a staircase up (maybe the equivalent of 5 minutes on a StairMaster) and emerged at the Kondiaronk Belvedere (what a badass name), a lookout point -- not the tippy top of the ""mountain"" but definitely near the summit. From there, we had a great vantage point to take in the whole city, especially the skyline. Fortunately, there was also a chalet open to the public with nice, clean restrooms. It was only a short walk from the chalet to the Smith House, which sells gifts, and more importantly, sorbet.Once we made it back down the stairs and down the hill, we emerged back into the city at the doorstep of the McGill campus, enabling us for more urban exploration (i.e. a lot more walking)."
"I went to Montreal over a year before writing this for a week long birthday vacation with my boyfriend. Growing up in the Midwest, United States, I spent most of my life deprived of mountainous regions. Before we even arrived to the city, I was determined to climb my first mountain - Mont Royal. After experiencing a few days of the city, we made the venture from our hotel in Longueuil to the park (after a brief stop for meat pies at Tourtiere Australienne! YUM!!). Never one to follow conventional wisdom, (or previously marked trails, for that matter) I - the trail guide for the day - decided to bush-wack our way up the side of the mountain. About half-way up, without a trail in sight, we realize that we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a situation. Above us was steep, crumbly dirt that was still wet from the rain from the last couple days. Below us was a slightly less steep drop, but jagged rocks, broken glass bottles, the few trees we'd been using to pull ourselves up, and just as much crumbly ground. With no choice at that point but to continue on, we scaled the side of the mountain by digging into the dirt until we finally found a path to continue on to. From the grounds around Chalet du Mont-Royal, you can see the whole city spread out in all of it's glory below you. We arrived just before dusk, so we had the immediate transition from the sunny scenery, to the rosy glow lending its light to the vista below. ¬†We found our way in the quickly departing light to the Croix du Mont-Royal - the peak of the mountain, and while I was busy taking pictures of the cross at night, my boyfriend was rummaging through his bag. I turned around to see what he thought of the view as he was getting down on his knee with a small box in his hand. He asked if I would climb more mountains with him, then he asked me to marry him! ¬†The Parc du Mont-Royal, and its namesake mountain will always hold a special place in my heart, but even if you don't have the same sentimental experience, it's still a great place to see!"
Being here in November would no doubt limit the amount of activities happening at Parc Mont Royal - but its still worth the trek to get to the top to see the view of Montreal. ¬†If my legs weren't absolutely shot from all the walking I'd been doing I would've probably come here and jogged to the top.The park mostly consists of joggers and walkers now with an insane population of grey squirrels I've ever seen! ¬†They are definitely not shy nor hungry as the locals feed them! ¬†We had a pack if almonds from the plane so we got some squirrel-feeding action of my own.
Its a great place to get some fresh air and also a view of the city of Montreal.
"Gotta gotta gotta come here on a Sunday afternoon around 1p. Around this time they have something called the ""Tam Tam"", this is where a bunch of strangers come to play their drums and make their own music. All you have to do is listen out for the drums and that will take you to the ""Tam Tam"".The park is also filled with people doing activities such as tight roping, hackysack, music, old war fighting with plastic swords, etc... Besides all of the activities you can take a mile and a half walk to the top of the park there you will get a great view of Downtown Montreal. Keep in mind the walk might get a bit tiresome. Park is also a nice place to take your bike and go for a stroll as there are lot of trails to visit."
"Since the city of Montreal gets its name from this hill overlooking the city, I knew that I had to make at least one trip there. ¬†I finally got my chance the last day of my trip when a colleague and I took a trip up there for the Tam Tams festival. ¬†It was a lovely park, reminding me of Central Park in NYC or Hyde Park in London but with this also comes the feeling that its maybe a bit too big. ¬†I personally found Parc Lafontaine (yelp.ca/biz/parc-lafonta‚Ä¶) to be more my style urban park - a bit smaller, a bit more landscaped, and a bit more home-like.We had problems finding places to sit because it was so popular that most of the benches were taken! ¬†We realize that the smart folks brought blankets with them so I'd suggest that if you're heading here, bring something to sit on if you're planning on resting your legs. ¬†But you still must come here if you're visiting Montreal! ¬†There are beautiful views of the city and you realize why the city was founded after such a beautiful place."
Beautiful park! The view is amazing. We were there in the afternoon but I would like to see the city at night time with all the pretty lights surrounding the city. Great place for a picnic with friends or just a couple..very romantic...
"shadow - this one goes to montreal because i was on the phone with my friend sara who lived in montreal at the time when she told me about this article she read about the a therapist who discussed the concept of one's 'shadow'. we all have a shadow. its the shitty unrealistic version of ourselves that only we can see. for example, my shadow's facial features are taking up WAY too much real-estate on his face .... and his speaking voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. point is ---- that phone call to montreal made me want to write this song for sara. something felt special about putting it out there in a grand way and not just on the call."
"I love Mont-Royal. ¬†Big time.Easy hike up, relaxing, quiet...Sigh."
"I fell in love with this park first year, when I was in residence at Gardner. The residence was essentially in the mountain and I would often go on walks to clear my head and sit and read. This is my favourite Olmstead park, in competition with Prospect Park.I have so many fond memories of Parc Mont-Royal. So many picnics there, so many days lying around eating baguettes and cheese during Tams. Walking dogs, jogging, sledding, going on pensive walks, climbing to the very top through unconventional, and possibly dangerous, ways. This park represents the spirit of Montr√©al, which is a difficult task to accomplish. I don't think you could visit Montr√©al without climbing the mountain and looking at this beautiful city."
"This has got to be the coolest park in Montreal and going up Mont-Royal is an amazing experience. ¬†When I lived in Montreal years ago, I used to love going up to the observation deck, I have been all weather and season and the scenery has always been beautiful! ¬†If you are in Montreal, this is a must-visit attraction!Cheers"
"On a pleasant Mid April afternoon,after visiting the Oratory of Saint Joseph in the city's Cote Des Neiges area,I spent several hours ambling around Mount Royal Park.I especially liked my walk around Beaver Lake amidst a few patches of snow that had not melted yet and of course,looking out at the center of downtown Montreal and its harbor from the Kondiaronk Belvidere by Chateau Mont Royal."
A beautiful place to be in winter ! And the view of Montreal is breathtaking !
"My friend and I took a nice hike up to the lookout in Parc du Mont Royal. ¬†It was a bit confusing because we didn't exactly know where we were going, but we asked for directions and figured it out. ¬†If you start from the main entrance on the east side of the park, you walk up to the main road, take a left onto the road, and follow it up. ¬†There were a lot of shortcuts over the switchbacks but I didn't really want to get lost, so I didn't take any of them.As people have mentioned, the main entrance was filled with drummers (?). ¬†Everyone tries to be hip in Montreal. ¬†The lookout area was nice and there's a building up there and some plaques pointing out the various sights of Montreal. ¬†There's also higher ground at the real summit, but we didn't have time to go there. ¬†On our way back to the main entrance, we encountered a bunch of people dressed in medieval gear, battling each other. ¬†It was pretty cool. ¬†They divided up into two groups. ¬†Someone signaled the beginning of the battle and they charged each other with padded swords and shields. ¬†Typical rules: if you're hit on the arm or leg, it's disabled. ¬†Everyone keeps fighting until one army is completely disabled. ¬†There were some archers, too, but foam tipped arrows didn't seem very effective as they didn't fly far or straight. ¬†I thought it was funny how the 10 year old kids hung at the back of the army and tried to rush in for a few quick flurries."
"This is a beautiful city park and I highly recommend that one visits on Sundays to witness Tam-Tam, a cultural event that has taken place in Montreal since the 1970s. You'll find an eclectic mix of individuals, from backpackers to hippies to hipsters and even a few families. ¬†Marijuana use is ubiquitous if not encouraged and a communal vibe pervades the atmosphere. ¬†Drum circle bands is the main draw. Feel free to bring a blanket and/or a frisbee or soccer ball or a good book. ¬†This is also a great place for groups."
"This really is one of the things that you must do when coming to Montreal! The view of Montreal skyline is absolutely stunning and the walk up is also quite nice. I would definitely recommend going there late and watching the sunset over Montreal, the colours are amazing!"
"Gorgeous park to visit in the fall - the leaves were so beautiful in the midst of their changing colors. We took the windy path to the top and skipped the stairs, taking one short cut at one point and beat several pairs we saw along the windy path. However, once we got to the top, we turned, and all we could see were trees and a parking lot. We headed west, and found three paths and a large lake, but never figured out how to get to ""the top"" for the views of the city skyline. Perhaps one should find a map so one know which trails to go. The few signs we saw were all in French and we don't read French too well. ¬†Oh well, it was still lovely to see and we got a decent work out. Lots of people were jogging, bicycling, and a couple were even using walking sticks. We viewed the peace monument. I learned that hiking through nature tends to give me right knee pain. Not sure whether I'm not walking right or what. I should really stop hiking. There are plenty of benches and cute streams to enjoy if you can't go higher up the hill. Because it's not really a mountain, being only 700-something feet high. Beautiful scenery. Poor signage."
"We are staying downtown and took the path behind the Rue de Pins that the first review mentions. ¬†That seemed to work out well. ¬†I would suggest taking the wooden stairs whenever offered the choice on that path if you want to get to the top fastest, we took the dirt paths and some stone stairs and kind of were lost for a few minutes and probably spent twenty extra minutes getting to the top. ¬†Anyway, as for the actual hike and view: the hike through the park is very nice, you feel like you are in a forest far away from any city most of the time. ¬†Once you get to the top you are rewarded with a tremendous view of the entire city, river, and distant mountains. ¬†I absolutely loved it, especially on a clear summer morning. ¬†Round trip from downtown on foot was less than two hours, and we did not go the quickest way we could have. ¬†Well worth your time if you like walking and the weather is ok."
"The single best park I've ever been to. The view from the chalet is great; I had the luxury of living downtown my first year in MTL and I could see my rooftop (among plenty of other landmarks) from there. I also suggest going up to the very highest peak, just above the cross. You'll get a killer workout on the ascent, anyway. Great open-air view, away from the relative grime of downtown."
"Dear Montreal,Thank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout). ¬†Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen. ¬†Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. Also, did not see the obese raccoon."
"This park is probably my favorite place in Montreal. The unexpected burst of nature right in the middle of the city was a welcome surprise. I could definitely see how the mastermind behind this park was the same one that designed Central Park, ¬†embedding a burst of nature into bustling NYC. It also reminded me a little bit of the parks with hikes embedded into San Francisco. The hike itself up to the top is not particularly difficult but not particularly easy either. Some parts are steep and you'll definitely work up a bit of a sweat. Its totally worth it though, as you'll get the best view possible of Montreal from the top, particularly around sunset. You can do the whole thing in an hour and a half or so if you are in a rush for time. If not, I would suggest bringing a book, some friends and maybe a bottle of wine-- ¬†spend an additional hour or two relaxing at the top soaking it all in. Somehow, someone had lugged a piano up to the top and we were able to listen to some nice music as well. Montreal is a city filled with pleasant surprises, and this park captures the spirit of the city perfectly."
Just a great view of the city from atop a hill
Other reviewer says that this park was designed by the same person who designed NYC's central park. I went to PDMR not knowing it. My first impression? I felt I was in Quebec's central park. And now I know I was right to say that. It's all too beautiful ¬†!!!!!
"If you plan on walking all the way to the top My advice: wear sweat wicking fabric and sneakers Just a fore warning,But other than that Its a beautiful scenery once you get to the top lovely view at night especially the enormous cross."
"Beautiful views and great spaces for walking, biking and relaxing."
Very nice place! Love the look outs! Especially the one with the view of downtown
"If there's any must-see in Montreal, this is it ¬†It's easy to get to, it's free, and you get great views of the city. ¬†We entered the park off Peel St, which is the entrence that's basically one huge staircase. ¬†Serioulsy, it was a lot, but take it slow and stop every so often to check out the view. ¬†You end up at the Chalet which is a big open building, great for warming up on a cold day. ¬†There are restrooms, a small gift shop and an area with vending machines. ¬†We were there in November so there really wasn't much of anything in bloom. ¬†But with all the leaves of the trees we were able to get some great views of the city that maybe don't exist in the spring/summer. we probably only saw a third of the park, but it was a great way to spend part of a morning!"
"oh! ¬†you can finally yelp internationally? ¬†well, even if it's just canada, it's better than nothing. ¬†Korea can't be far behind!anyway, gosh this park brings back memories of times past. ¬†i loved walking through mcgill and then up the hill! ¬†can't wait to visit again!"
"Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead (the same guy who designed NYC's Central Park), this park is located on Mont Royal (the ""mountain"" that gives Montreal its' name). ¬†It's made up of a walking and biking trails that wind their way through trees, a small pond, a chalet and belvedere with awesome views of Montreal's cityscape, a lighted cross that can seen all over the city, the Oratoire St-Joseph (a shrine known for its miracles), and the early city cemeteries. ¬† Probably the most visited place in the park is the chalet and its' belvedere with absolutely the best views of downtown Montreal, the St. Lawrence river valley and the mountains beyond. (If you only have an hour to take in the park, this is the thing to do.) ¬†But I also enjoyed the rest of the park too, particularly the Oratoire and the George-Etienne Cartier monument with its' Tam-Tam drummers. The Oratoire is gorgeous and gives free guided tours but check the website for more information.The park covers about 500 acres, so be prepared to walk everywhere. ¬†There also is the height factor and the top of Mont-Royal is about 700 feet (about 290 m) and the grade is steep. ¬†To go straight up to the chalet, there are stairs from the downtown entrance on rue Peel...a lot of them. ¬†You can take a more leisurely route to the chalet by following the walking paths with its' signs but that route takes much longer. ¬†Luckily, the park signs will direct you everywhere, but it's still nice to have a map of the park or to at least have read up on it. ¬† Don't care to walk the park? You can rent a city bike or you can get a horse-drawn carriage (and in the wintertime, a sleigh) to take you around the park. ¬†There are also a few city buses that stop at the cemeteries. ¬†The buses and carriages cost and there are several carriage companies in different locations to choose from so it's best to check the internet for this. To hoof it on your own two feet, the park is free. It's really nice to bring a picnic lunch to enjoy. ¬†The only bathrooms I found were at the chalet and the only amenities' stand (except for the occasional public drinking fountain) was also at the chalet. ¬†The shortest way to access the park is from the rue Peel Metro Station (if walking) or the Guy-Concordia Metro station (if taking the bus to the cemeteries), but you can also use the Mont-Royal Metro stop to access the northwest corner of the park ¬†(but it's a much longer hike). ¬†I wound my way on foot through the park and saw everything in a little under 4 hours.An absolute must for anyone who likes nature or panoramic views."
"Parc du Mont-Royal (or Mount Royal if you prefer) is a lovely oasis of scenic greenery just north of downtown Montreal. ¬†History buffs might be interested to know that it was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the very same guy who also designed Central Park in Manhattan. ¬†And this FLO guy had some serious park designing game! ¬†As an American who was priveledged enough to live near Montreal for about 6 years, I can say that it's shocking just how FEW tourists that journey to Montreal make it up to the Park. ¬†Maybe it's because it's a bit of an effort, (it is a small mountain afterall) but it's an effort well worth it and rich in payoff. ¬†If you've never been to the top of Mont Royal on a hot summers night, then in my opinion you've missed out on a pivotal and wonderful piece of the Montreal experience. ¬†You get a gorgeous view of the entire city with the St. Lawrence river draped around it in the background. ¬†And dont even get me started about how beautiful it is in the fall with all the foliage and turning leaves. ¬†On a nice clear night, I doubt there could be many places more romantic in the entire city."
"What a surprise to walk up to the peak to find not only the best views of the city, but the Chalet du Mont Royal. ¬†You can also find the large cross that lights up at night. ¬†Lots of people walking and biking around. ¬†Left with some great pictures and 2 mosquito bites."
"As far as urban parks go, this one is a jewel. ¬†This park is probably my favorite thing about Montreal. ¬†I've visited Montreal a few times and just about every morning, I've jogged the helical trail up the mountain with the masses of fit locals (and maybe tourists) to the chalet where I am rewarded with a spectacular view of the city. ¬†I hope to continue this tradition with my subsequent visits to this city (weather permitting)."
Mont-royal is a MUST see if you are in Montreal. The view is absolutely amazing and you'll also get a fair amount of workout as well. The parking is an issue though because it fills up quickly. I think the best way to get up there is to hop on bus 11.
"As has been noted, the best views of Montreal are to be had from Mount Royal, and for good reason: not only does it look out over all of downtown and the St. Lawrence, but its peak is at about the same height as many of Montreal's bigger office buildings. When you go up to Kondiaronk Belvedere, the main lookout area, don't miss the little brass sights on the edge, which point out all the major landmarks.Another nice thing about Mount Royal is its accessibility; the walk up the winding road isn't too taxing, but if you want to get up faster, and don't mind a bit of a workout, there are a series of stairs that go right up the slope. It's an excellent place to go for a walk if you live off Parc or in the McGill ghetto, all year round."
"Wonderful place. Beautiful to go for a walk or just sit by the lake. I'll skip the pedal boats next time, though. Better just to lay down in the grass."
"On our recent trip to Montreal I was lucky enough to be able to run here almost everyday during our week long stay. This park is amazing. Beautiful views, clean grounds, lots of families out enjoying nature and their surroundings. I took my family there as welland they loved it! If you can, rent a paddle boat and enjoy a leisurely ride around Beaver Lake. At $10. CAD for 30 minutes it was a bargain. My daughter loved it. Theres so much to see and enjoy here and it's free. I was one of the highlights of this beautiful city."
"You should read Amanda C.'s review (just before mine) to get a true flavor of this wonderful place. ¬†We drove up there for the 180-degree view of the city and we weren't disappointed. ¬†It was a warm day at the end of September and we took some fantastic panoramic photos from the top of the Mont. ¬†Of course, the ice cream sandwich made it even more enjoyable. ¬† Definitely make a stop here if you're in town."
Nice view. Great to see the city light. Well worth the drive up just to see.
"Run, don't walk, for the real challenge."
Parc du Mont-Royal has probably one of the prettiest views of a city. It is definitely worth going to. Probably one of my biggest highlights.
"I trekked up to the very top by foot and it took awhile but at the end, you will be rewarded with a fantastic view of the skyline of Montreal."
"You can never compare the wonders of immense nature in a city with another that is simply a concrete jungle. In fact, this somewhat compares to New York's Central Park. With so much action and adventure, summer is the best time of year to hang out here. You can picnic, play games or cycle, jog or walk, or just people gaze. It's a bit of a hippy playground which thrives on the tam tam jam culture but this park is just as fun in winter. I've not personally been so far but it's good for winter activities such as snowshoeing, toboganning, et al. Just ideal for those amused by typically Canadian outdoor activities. This is one of the best places to hiss away or go with a large group and is one of the larger parks that I've been to. Best part is that it's right in the city's heart. Can't go wrong here!"
Pick a sunny day. The views are incredible from the Chalet. Wish I could see it in summer. Take the 11 bus if you don't want to make a long hike.
"Every truly great city has a great park, and Montreal is no exception. Mont Royal is a lovely place to take a stroll and it has the best view of the city. We entered the park via the entrance with a billion staircases. I thought I was going to die. But then you get to the top and take in the view, and it's completely worth it. There is a way to access the park without the stairs, but I'm not going to tell you about it because you probably need the exercise if you enjoyed as much of Montreal's fine cuisine as I did. It was a chilly, yet sunny, day when we there, so I can only imagine how the park must come alive in the summer. There was a recreational-type area that was being renovated. There are also two cemeteries that border the park and make for some interesting wandering if you have the time. This is a must is you are a visitor to Montreal, and I envy the citizens of Montreal who get to enjoy this lovely park on a regular basis."
"I did not exactly do any research before heading up here (I sometimes forget that yelp has ratings for anything other than dining establishments. Actually, I often forget that there is more to life than eating in general, for that matter). My thought process was, ""Well, I'm only up here for a while and I've got some free time; I should try to make it to the top of that big hill over there."" I went up via the two-lane gravel road off of park avenue, coupled with the massive set of stairs. The quicker way, for the record, I found on the way back, which is to go up the gravel switchbacks off of rue pins right behind the McGill campus. Either way, at the top of the steps, going left and up a further gravel path leads one to the Chalet, with some local vendors and excellent views. The better view, in my opinion, is had by going to the right at the top of the long staircase and then following the path there for a couple hundred yards. There's a small platform with sweeping views to the northeast.I was also interested to see that someone else had alluded to seeing a band shooting a music video up there. When I went up myself (6/27/2011), there was a bigtime video production going on at the top near the chalet, with trucks full of equipment and staff directing people around the filming site. Must be the cool thing to do around here."
"originally landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted (Central Park, Prospect Park, Belle Isle Park), the park is the heart (and lungs) of the city and its ultimate recreation destination--think: ¬†walking, running, cycling, hiking, skating, sledding, skiing, snowshoeing, etc."
"I went to Montreal a couple of weeks ago for the first time. ¬†I'd always wanted to go and thought I'd like the city and it didn't disappoint. ¬†One of the best parts of the city for me though was Mont-Royal, and I didn't even see half of the park.I actually visited the park twice during my extended weekend stay in the city. ¬†I went up to the park via Rue Peel my first time. ¬†I would recommend heading up to the park this way, or at least heading down this way if you can. ¬†It's great starting from the city and looking up Rue Peel to Mont-Royal. ¬†You also get to walk through the McGill University campus on the way up. ¬†When you reach the park via this route you can immediately access Chemin Olmsted, a walking path that was originally designed as a gravel road for horse-drawn carriages by Fredrick Law Olmsted. ¬†This is the scenic, winding and easy-going way to see the park. ¬†It's great because you're largely surrounded by woods, other paths, and little streams and waterfalls depending on where you are. ¬†However if you're in a hurry and went to get straight to the top, you can take that route as well. ¬†Once you get there you've got the Chalet and a great view downtown, the St. Lawrence and beyond below. ¬†On my second visit to the park during my stay I decided to cut through the park rather than take the metro back to my hotel. ¬†I was in Outremont which is a quite a hike from downtown. ¬†However it was a great hike as I went through the park along Chemin Olmsted. ¬†It was a bit of a dreary and drizzly day, but the park was still beautiful. ¬†There were still bikers, hikers and runners out too. ¬†If I loved in Montreal I'd be in the park a few times week, Winter, Summer, Spring and especially Fall. ¬†Montreal has a real gem in Parc du Mont-Royal and it's one of the highlights of the city."
"This is a great place to go in Montreal. The view of the city is spectacular. The park and flowers are really beautiful. After you're done, you can have a drink and some lunch at the restaurant in the park. What's better than that?"
"I took the stairs. ¬†Counted in terms of normal flights on the way down, and figure it is about 15 flights all told. ¬†Really good workout in a nice environment. ¬†Views are fabulous. ¬† Lots of families, exercise enthusiants, and tourists, but not so crowded to feel claustrophobic. ¬†Beautiful open space at the top."
"All roads lead to the canal and this is one of the many entry points to the canal. ¬†It's the closest one to me so we use it often. ¬†Also, if you've been walking a while and need a little pick me up, just head up Peel as there are several places to grab a quick snack (Starbucks, La Bete a Pain, Dairy Queen, along with several restaurants), before you continue on your trek along the canal. If you want a healthier option, there is a gym that has a snack counter that makes smoothies and other power drinks.I wish I knew more of the history to share other than this area used to be no mans land but had become an up and coming area if it's not already there with its fabulous food scene and designer interior decor boutiques. It's a beautiful mix of old and new. On one side you have ¬†great views of the famous Farine Five Roses building. Across the canal you have an endless line of condo construction all seeking to outdo the next with amazing amenities. ¬†It's all gorgeous."
The place is pretty small but every ramps were made very well! They have many vending machines but no cafeteria. The Skateshop is very nice and have a large selection of boards. All in all its a great place
"Quite honestly one of the coolest hidden spots in Montreal. If you want to impress a date, have a romantic picnic, hang out with a friend, drive around aimlessly contemplating life itself, this is your spot. There is a park spot with some bleachers and a parking lot, both are great for plane watching. You will need a car to get here and if it's cold I don't recommend watching from outside. But in the summer, bring some picnic chairs and watch away!"
"Great for plane-spotters! There's benches, bleachers, lost of open space, and cool information boards with info on the planes and the airport. This woukd make a great place for a picnic. If you are an avid plane-watcher, you can't miss this!"
"What a great place on a Sunday morning to come out and play some baseball. The nice sized park is perfect for baseball (not everyone plays softball) with a good home-run fence. The infield is made with red sand that fields well for infield ground balls if the sand is groomed well before the game. Please note: red sand means red marks when you slide on the bases so it dirty. Happy to play there again, even if I hit horribly last game! lol."
The little park in front of Mount Royal. I had always thought this park was a part of Mount Royal until about 2 years ago when I noticed the yelp page. This is where they host the Indian festival.I great little spot to have a picnic or play a game of tennis/soccer.
"A perfect and beautiful spot chosen for festival of India in Montreal. This park is exactly across the Mont Royal Park. It's beautiful and huge enough for playgrounds for children and sport field are all present. The festival of India of itself was an average affair. I was excepting more as Indian person. One of the best part is free feast for everyone; the line up was huge. It is very well know, India as country is multicultural as itself (north/south/west/east), and multi religion (Hindu mainly, with Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian). This festival was promoting the Hindu religion more than showing the culture of India by the performances (religious chants; selling religious books and clothes). There were few activities that were neutral as henna tattoo booth, gift shops, spices shops...Hopefully, in coming years, the festival will better and improved."
Its a perfect place to have lunch at my brake. Lot of picnic tables under the shade. Different kind of people's. Always quiet
"Nice little park that is well taken care of.Large lawn area for picnics with some tables set up.Get your sweat on with the tennis and volleyball courts.Take a seat by the monument, take in some sun, and watch the traffic go by.Just a good park to kick back in, lay out, take a nap, or throw around the frisbees.Also, we did not notice one piece of trash, wrappers, or bottles on the ground. Well done."
"If you are going to chill or play sports nothing is more a quintessential Montreal location than Parc Jean-Mance. It has everything though we come here most often for Soccer or Tennis. The Tennis courts over looks the mountain and the cross so it is PICTURE PERFECT. Be smart if you're playing seriously make sure to not be distracted and face away from the mountain -lol. The tennis courts are reasonably priced, especially if you have a ""Montreal Carte Acess"" and they are in pretty good condition. The Soccer turf field is artificial and in very good shape - perfect for Football or Soccer"
"The original picnic park, we used to meet here along the Esplanade side between the tennis courts and the soccer field where you could sit at picnic tables, bring a bbq and cooler and enjoy the brief warmer summer evenings. People who live in the beautiful brightly-coloured old stone homes that line the park bring out tablecloths and cutlery and lamps and paper decorations for next level outdoor eating. The lower part of the park has the beach volleyball courts, and the west side of the park is where the ""mountain"" begins... but that's a whole other Yelp review."
"Love this park! With the mountain perched up on the other side of the street, the excellent sports facilities, and pick-up ultimate frisbee games, it's the perfect spot to get your exercise, or just lay back, have a picnic (good spread of picnic tables), and do some people watching. In winter it features a hockey rink, and still nice to walk through."
"This park is full of life because it serves the needs of many different kids of people. On the evening I arrive, people are drumming near the statues overlooking the park. Mostly young people grooving on the beat, their own dancing, or just the pleasure of spontaneous music and crowds.The park is a perfect model of integrating passive (lying in the sun, enjoying a picnic, smooching) and active (soccer, football tossing, cycling) recreation. The are also spaces for practical functions, such as community composting.Encouraging passive recreation is especially important in an area dominated by apartments and flats; enjoying Nature without an activity in mind is just what a crowded downtown area needs lots of. Many things illegal in parks are tolerated. The fragrance of marijuana is commonplace. So are fruit ke bobs, from vendors who are chased out of most ¬†public parks.I would say that if pot is tolerated (as it should be in moderation), the same should go for vending of healthy foods and beverages -- an argument I make in my e-book Food for City Building.Parks such as this are ideal places to support healthy food artisans who enhance the multiple functions of a dynamic urban people park."
"This is the park to go if you LOVE outdoor activities. You can do it all here, from soccer to tennis. All that's missing is a basketball hoop and you have yourself a fully equipped outdoors gym. And during Sundays there is a sea of people on Mount-Royal that are taking some vitamin D. Jeanne-Mance park is the ideal kick-it spot for everyone."
"Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood is putting a lot of effort into making the lives of its residents a pleasant one, Morgan Park is one of those improvements, and honestly, what's not to like about that place? The beautiful fountain at the entrance, the landscaping, the two playgrounds for kids, the exercise trail, the numerous restaurants surrounding the area (location, location! Chez Bouffe is located a few steps away) as well as the two water games areas linked by a stream. Yep, this family-friendly park is definitely one of my favorites in Montreal."
"This park is no Mount Royal, and there are plenty of alternatives, but it still made for a great afternoon nature walk with the dog. Saw some woodpeckers, plenty of people and dogs, and there are at least 2 chalets (start and mid way points) with ski rentals, hot chocolate cash machines, and public restrooms. Winter trails dedicated to and marked for hikers, snowshoers, and skiers. Had a pretty nice walk of about 6-7km. I do agree with some other viewers though that the proximity to high speed routes and residential areas does take away from the ""nature vibe""."
"Nice spot to go cross country skiing or for a walk in the woods, but not spectacular, there are prettier waterfront areas not at all far away (e.g. Hudson) and more fun cross country ski trails in the city (Mount Royal.) If you are looking for a small green adventure on the island, sure why not, but I wouldn't hugely highly recommend it. We parked and followed the arrows that suggested we'd see water. We ended up crossing under a highway on our nature walk, getting led in a loop that pointed back to the parking, walked past 2 Germans laughing at us for getting duped by the same path as they had followed... but we had keen eyes and spotted another entrance into the forest, so we crossed a busy suburban street that feeds the highway and did find the water we'd been promised by the many signs, and though the sun was just setting on the islands and the river and it was pretty, the highway was still in sight, the roar never quiet."
"Nice woods, especially by the water. The noise from Autoroute 13 which you hear through most of the park really runs the nature vibe, however."
"It's pretty...but it's not the best of the LaSalle Blvd Parks, in my opinion because u can't really sit anywhere too close to the water. We sat right next to the water but it appears we sat right in the middle of a walking path as we unfortunately realized by the time the 3rd set of pedestrians n pooches came by. This park seems like it might have some good spots to cast out n fish from, however I didn't catch a glimpse of any signs that either authorized or prohibited fishing in the park, will try n take a better look around next time. Plenty of picnic tables and benches and big open grassy spots to set up a picnic up the hill from the water though. Would be willing to check it some more but not my favorite spot so far."
"The Verdun part of the chain of parks along LaSalle Boulevard and the southern-most shoreline of the island, which run through Verdun, LaSalle and Lachine all the way to the Mercier Bridge. It is also probably the narrowest of the parks.I'd say the best parts of this park at the wharves which are great for star-gazing during ¬†summer nights. During the day, they are full of swimmers, fishers and pot-heads who seem to be drinking beer all day long. The hiking trail is also pretty fun too esp. for spotting turtles, snakes, Canadian geese, and muskrats."
"I'm not a language person (only knowing Bonjour and Merci) but I picked up 3 French words while walking the streets of Montreal and 1 while sitting shotgun on the car ride here. ¬†Rue = Street, Vieux = Old, Place = Plaza, and Arret = Stop. ¬†(We also learned how to pronounce Rue Saint Urbain from a bus driver.)Place Jacques-Cartier is a very lively PLAZA in the heart of Old Montreal. ¬†It's the perfect spot for people watching, especially if you're sitting at one of the outdoor dining areas on the sides. ¬†Street performers and tour groups can also be found here. ¬†If you walk towards Saint Lawrence River, you'll be near the piers (Old Port), which is just as lively."
"Place Jacques-Cartier is a square between rue Notre-Dame and rue de la Commune in the Old Montreal section. It is a somewhat steep street which at the top has a replica of the Admiral Horatio Nelson statue, the original was removed in 1997. This is the area where the gardens of the Chateau Vaudreuil ¬†once stood in 1723. The square was named in 1847 after Jacque- Cartier, the explorer who claimed Canada for the French crown.Today, Place Jacques-Cartier is lined with restaurants, shops and auberges. Street artists and kiosks are visible during the summer while lighted trees decorate the Christmas season. The street has classical Parisian style terraces. The oldest restaurant, Saint Amable lies in this area. An original piece of the historic fortress wall of Montreal can be found in the basement of Auberge du Vieux-Port.. The side streets host an assortment of craft shops, boutiques and restaurants. It is a car-free pedestrian zone."
"Place Jacques-Cartier in Old Montreal has its charm in different seasons. But of course it is the prettiest during springs and summers when all the flowers are blooming.Numerous bistro and bars lining up both side of the Square with outside patio area.There are also live entertainment: performers, musicians, stand up comedians and more.Quite enjoyable for an after dinner stroll."
"As another Yelper mentioned, this square lies in the heart of Old Montreal. ¬†It runs from Hotel De Ville (City Hall) to to the waterfront.Usually, this spot gets very busy. ¬†The afternoon that we were here, it was raining and nothing happening. ¬†Bad luck on our part. ¬†Normally, it is a great place to people watch and see street artists performing. ¬†Also, their would be vendors set up at their stalls ready to sell you something.Oh well, maybe next time. ¬†I am still a fan, though."
"At the heart of Old Montreal, in front of the infamous Hotel de Ville, sits Place Jacques Cartier as the doorway to this gorgeous area of our city. The pedestrian walkway, lined with restaurants, booths, and cute little gift shops, makes way to the cobblestone streets and nooks of the old city where you can easily spend the day. I still love playing tourist in my own city; mingling with the visitors or grabbing a drink on a terrace is part of the charm of this square. Either way, there is always something happening here so go on and explore!"
"Yesterday while visiting Old Montreal and the Old Ports we walked through Place Jacques-Cartier as we wandered through the area. When we arrived at Jacques it was still a bit early in the day so the area wasn't as busy as it could have been, but that being said we enjoyed looking through the shops in the area and additionally loved looking at some of the street vendors who had arrived for the day.Overall, Jacques is an incredible area in Old Montreal and it has a great view of the waterfront. It is definitely a must see when in the area and the next time we visit we hope that it is during their ""on season"" and not the ""off season"" as was this time around."
"This square lies in the heart of Old Montreal, bordered on the north and south by the waterfront and City Hall. It's a vibrant, beautiful area, filled with outdoor terraces and bistros and cafes, paved in cobblestones and populated by artisans and musicians. There are narrow old alleyways off the central square, filled with photographers and painters and jewelers selling their wares. There are ivied courtyard restaurants and, yes, the usual array of touristy shops selling local tchotchkes.There's nothing better than having a glass of sangria at a table outside in the summertime here, watching the chic Montrealers and all the tourists go by. And in e evening, there are some nice clubs and restaurants to visit. Old Montreal is my favorite part of Montreal, and this old square is truly its heart."
the seafood in Montreal is good..lobster.......but the rain is tooooo heavy today...all wet.....
"I enjoy coming to Beaver Lake in the winter to ice skate. There's always a nice atmosphere with the surrounding trees and shining lights. On some of the days, especially weekends, they play music. Also, there's a main building in which there are lockers to put your belongings (bring a lock), a rental area for gear you can use in the park, and a canteen for food. I usually stay for about 1h30 as the lake is quite small and it gets repetitive to go around in the same circle. There are two paid parking lots available."
"I've never been to a landfill but this place reminded me of one! We went in the late evening and saw swarms of large families camped out all over the place with their BBQ smoke and litter exploiting the park. There were pigeons all over the place snacking on the debris. Children were running wild. The worst part, the smell. Worse than a landfill. This is a man made 2 ft deep ""lake"" on top of the hill. There is also a man made ""waterfall"" that is filled with unattended kids running up and down amok. There is also a ""park"" with only 2 baby swings (no children swings) and a spider web to crawl in.Also, crowded parking lots that you have to pay to park in. Definitely avoid if you have any standards!"
"Lovely Mile End park! Small compared to Laurier or Jarry but a god city block long and lots of trees. This park went through some renovations recently and it seems like there is more art, more fountains, more flower beds, and more places to sit, all of which is lovely. The park sits in front of a beautiful Montreal church and is just a short walk from a little strip of cute clothing and houseware shops on St Laurent, and fresh bagels and delicious gelato on Fairmount, so it's a perfect spot for a break from walking around. In the winter there is usually an installation in the middle with Christmas trees for sale, a small stage with live folk music, and a roaring fire. Which is my favourite."
"Terrific park on the eastern side of Nun's Island, with an undeveloped waterfront with wide open views of the South Shore and Champlain Bridge. Not a lot of picnic tables or park benches but everyone who shows up here seems to be well stacked with their own stuff, inflatable kayaks, stand-up paddles, outdoor bbq, volleyball nets, etc. Nun's Island has an extensive network of bike paths but there's also a great hiking trail along the waters edge, in the back yards of the exclusive residences of this wealthy bedroom community, which also intersect at this park. Given how crazy ""mainland"" Verdun has become in the past 3 years especially that dank beach, I'm happy ¬†to find a much quieter, cleaner and natural place where I can watch the birds, read books underneath ¬†the cool shade of willow trees and possibly venture and wade in the water and not have to see a single obnoxious hipster or man-bun in sight."
"I feel compelled to write a review about this little park immediately. Why would somebody wonder? Because I just listened to Orchestre M√©tropolitain performing in West Vancouver Park and attempted to check in during a pause between the musical peices. Well, the park didn't even exist in Yelp. Of corse this is no longer the case as I just created it. So one may ask why at √éle des S≈ìurs exists a park with such an unusual name. It appears the city of Verdun is a twin municipality with West Vancouver, therefore the name. I truly hope the municipality of West Vancouver has a park named Verdun. Now about the park. It is accessible via bike path and has a little playground. The best part is the park is at Saint Laurence and you can go to the river through few access points through the threes. There are also few picnic tables near the water. During cold seasons the park offers some breathtaking views of the river, but the local residents really crowd around during the summer and in big numbers. Orchestre M√©tropolitain performs at West Vancouver park every year during the first weekend of August. Whoever came with the idea to create this amazing event in beautiful surroundings is a genious. The orchestra is outstanding, the concert programme is always oriented towards more popular and easy to listen classical works, the best approach for a diverse public. Considering the fact the talented conductor Yannick Nezet-S√©guin is the new musical director of the Met, tonight Ile des S≈ìur felt like Manhattan of Montreal. Thus the five stars!"
"Center of it all. When I got here early evening the stalls near the square were already packing up. I liked the flowers in the area, and the Tourist Information office next to it. It was spring and coming from Asia, tulips are very rare in my hometown, so imagine my joy when I saw the budding tulips. I fell in love with this quaint little park."
"Nice little square in the middle of the busy office & shopping district. During the summer, there are a few stalls selling handmade jewellery, flowers, fruits and house plants. If you work nearby and want to enjoy your lunch outdoors, or if you are just passing by and take a break from the hustle & bustle, this is a decent little spot."
"A lovely stretch of green space by the river front. Great for walking, biking, rollerblading and plenty of places to walk dogs as well. Many trees are dispersed over the space and places to set up a picnic or spread out a blanket to read or rest. There are several options of paths; at varying distances from the waterfront. There are even a few spots for fishing and looking at wildlife; like ducks and loons. It's a bit of an oasis, but then again Montreal is an island, so if you look you'll find a fair amount of shoreline to explore - but this particular spot stands out to me."
"So this park is yet another extension on the whole LaSalle BLVD bike path. My goal is to eventually figure out the 'boundaries' of where each park ends and the next starts. This one starts at the boundary of Parc des Rapides at the LaSallel/Verdun border. Several nice spots to pop a squat down by the water. Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy! There's a look out point too, a deck overlooking the river. It's been fairly busy each time we've passed so we haven't stopped to enjoy it yet. Our dog likes it over here too, safe to be here being it's technically Verdun so she's not prohibited lol. Lots of other dogs too, enjoying the nice walk with their owners. **...We think we saw a tick today tho, crawling across our picnic blanket after Irie traipsed through the dead-long grass, so beware! Next time we're bringing the tick-kit just in case but Irie didn't get bit today...**"
"A park which pretty much straddles the southern-most shoreline of the island of Montreal, along the eastern parts of Lasalle from Parc des Rapides going into Verdun. I'd say there are three parts to the park. First there's the green space between Lasalle Boulevard and the bike paths. This is where you have a small playground for kids, water fountains, soccer field, the Natatorium (the first public outdoor swimming pool in Canada), the greenhouse, a beach volleyball sandlot, and lots and lots of open green, grassy space interspersed with trees and bushes, which on hot summer days is taken up with families doing BBQs, couples picnicking, people on blankets napping, reading books, doing work on their devices, playing frisbee etc.Second, there is the bike path which runs along the riverside and now a gravel path specifically for pedestrians right alongside the bike path since traffic on the bike path is so busy now with bikers, roller-bladers and runners. Third, there is a hiking trail, below the bike path right along the river's edge and this is my favorite part. It's full of trees, bushes, wild grass and it not manicured at all and runs a little wild in some places. This is where, if you happen to be at the right time and right place, you'll see ducks, Canada geese, owls, muskrats, blue herons, Arctic terns, turtles, grass snakes, a beaver or two, raccoons, foxes, pike jumping out of the water (I've seen all of them), ¬†and on occasion, like this past winter, a bald-head eagle and seal which a local photographer caught on camera. There's also rapids and on clear days, you can see right over to Mont St.Gregoire, Mont St.Bruno and Mont St. Hilaire in the distance. There are also some great quiet spots where you can easily sit down among the large boulders and small grassy knolls and just take in the scenery, meditate and do whatever. While the rest of Montreal obsesses over ""The Mountain"" and crowded Mont-Royal park, I say let them be and come down to ""The River"" instead."
Wonderful view over fleuve St Laurent. Few benches to impress your new lover with the amazing view and whashroom availble on the top of park.
"IMPORTANT BABY LAMB RELATED UPDATE: ""The borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie has approved a plan to bring about fifteen lambs and sheep to Pelican Park this July. Their task? Eat grass.The pilot project comes following a proposal last year from Mathyas Lefebure, who was a shepherd in France for a decade before moving to Montreal.He says grazing sheep is an environmentally-friendly way to maintain and fertilize green spaces. He also wants to use sheep to educate city dwellers about farming.""cbc.ca/news/canada/montr‚Ä¶"
"Let me start this one off by saying VerdunLOV for SURE! But as far as Verdun goes, this park: √ßa fait dur! I'm not one of those ppl that sees this 'hood as a ghetto I love the shops, the people and the spots that make it special But this park is just disgusting and sad It's all that is wrong with Verdun, it's that badThe water is lined with garbage and beer cans With a strong foul odour that we just couldn't stand It's the type of place that would make any nature-lover weep So much potential but lacking much needed upkeep.------------- Installment 25 poetry reviewsThis park was such a disappointment. We discovered it on another bike ride down the river. I suppose the main park is a simple open grassy spot good for a picnic or family gathering it's bordered by trees near the bike/pedestrian paths and there are a few spots to head down to the water edge......But your view is the Champlain bridge and all the construction blended with so much garbage even the several pieces we did pick up (for sake of trying to respect nature) didn't make a difference in how gross it was here. Skipping this place from now on. It's a shame, the trees are beautiful over the water.Ppl, seriously: RESPECT nature: clean up ur SH*T!"
"My buddy Angela M and I set ourselves a mission of exploring Montreal on our bikes this summer, both to stretch our local horizons and to build up our bike muscles. So on a not-too-hot Saturday end of July we set out from Mile-Ex to Parc Bellerive with the intention of catching a ferry there over to the √Æles de Boucherville National Parc. The parc itself was bigger and more lovely than we knew, we could have just hung out there. On that particular Saturday there was a festival happening celebrating Mexican culture with food and a big stage with live music. Families spilled out beyond the gates of the festival, picnicking and BBQing in the parc. The park runs along the waterfront, it's wide and breezy and full of trees and water access for splashing with puppy dogs or doing some fishing. There is a cute gazebo near where the ferry docks. The ferry runs every hour on the hour till 5pm in the summer and costs $9 including your return fare. It's perfectly setup for taking bikes over to the islands, we had a great time and can't wait to go back! The parc Bellerive itself is 22 hectares, we didn't explore it all but it looks like a great place to go for a run, or hang out with your family and friends and watch the rushing water of the Fleuve St Laurent."
"Cool little park! ¬†I assume there isn't always a big ""Fringe"" sign up surrounded by tents. ¬†But as long as they serve beer there I'll be back. ¬† Wait, they won't? ¬†I have to think this one through. ¬†I like parks and all but....I would go back one day in the hope that there is another band playing, and maybe I sneak my own drink in..."
"Oh teeny park of my heart, with your flourish of a stone stage, your acoustics charmed by the lofty towers across the street, your proximity to Romados and Patati for ardent picniking, how I love thee. This will be my 6th year having the pleasure and honour of booking bands and curating art events in the park with Fringe for Indyish and every year it's a highlight. Being right in the middle of the action on St Laurent but in a sunny, tree-lined floaty little oasis is kind of the dream space to bring live music to a stage. Even that one year it rained hard for a few minutes and we ran all over covering the gear with tarps was kind of magical, and in the end the skies always seem to clear on time in Parc des Ameriques."
A smallish park in between 2 of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. ¬†I've come here with food in the past and just relaxed and hung out. ¬†There's not much here UNLESS RISA brings her awesome bands by to play some music during Fringe. ¬†It was there that I learned to use a kazoo!Besides Fringe though it's just a small park in between great neighbourhoods.
"Cute little Parc,well surrender by local businesses which is cool! I been there only once and had a great time at The Yelp Kazzoo Montreal Fringe Show.Looking forward to another opportunity to go there."
Fringe +Yelp = a rocking good time. The space was perfect for the small crowd that formed and there was plenty of seating. I was def impressed with the lineup of bands (the ones we actually saw anyway). We didn't stay long since we had other plans but it was a great local experience i really enjoyed.
"Two words.Veggie Burger!We wandered over to this beautiful open space to relax and check out a circus performance and were pleasantly surprised by the environment that included a bar, DJ, and dance floor. They have a 'snack bar' on site which is an understatement as the options are much more gourmet than you would expect. I had the veggie burger and a friend had the lobster roll, both of which were restaurant quality dishes and I can't wait until it gets warm enough again to have some more!The environment itself is relaxing and inviting. The levels of grass allows you to lounge and relax while you take in a little bit of everything around you and if you have a lot of energy, a DJ is set up near the snack bar if you feel like salsa dancing (beware there are some pretty good salsa dancers who come out). All-in-all a great place to bask in the Montreal summer.Edit: June 2016 The veggie burger is no longer on their menu! For shame!!"
"Very cool multi-purpose space in downtown Montreal. People are lounging, drinking, eating, watching the game. Very eclectic mix of people representing Montreal well. From past pictures it looks like a great venue for large events. This particular day we went there was a noticeable number of homeless people. They were harmless though soaking up the sun like everyone else, just dirty and appearing sketchy at first. I love the incorporated artwork - sculptures, a massive net in the sky, and water fountains embedded into the field. There's a covered patio with a large number of tables and then some high tops next to the food stand that has a full set up for hot food and beverages, including a full bar and even healthy fruit and yogurt smoothies. The BLT was enticing as some other menu items, but we stuck with beverages. There was a large flat screen with surprisingly good audio for outdoors; everyone was crowding around it making for a fun, spirited time. Cash only, but they accept US dollars."
"Many activities here in this park, also fast food available. Wonderful atmosphere in summers. Dance, shows, food and more.Only few tables but bring your tablecloth and lay down in the grass."
This place is a breather in the city center. Tree and fun under the sun.Also some pok√©stops.Take a book at the grande biblioth√®que and go read there in the park.
"Great cozy neighborhood feel! Adore the re-use of stacked wooden pallets as benches all around. This park is got it goin on! Ping pong tables. A stage for local bands and singer/songwriters to preform. Small tables and chairs for viewing pleasure. There was free swing dance lessons going on one of the nights we were there. And the grassy hill for blankets, people lounging, stone waterways that makes a stream from the top to the bottom of the slight incline. Flanked on two sides with two of the busiest streets in Montreal, this is where we spent several of our nights winding down after dinner."
"What an awesome and beautiful park on the corner of St Catherine and Berri! We were lucky to overlap the free cirque show the week we were here. The audio was great considering it was an open public space. Great lighting and color smoke and a zip line too. There are some public wooden benches you can sit on. First come, First serve! If you don't get these, you could bring a small blanket to sit on the grass as well. The free show was fantastic tonight. It does run late (1 hr late to be exact!) Overall, would recommend if you're in town!"
"Definitely contested territory but I love that different parties are working to make this a space that helps make space for - and ideally even connections between - the homeless and addict populations that gather here, local organizations, businesses, students, tourists, and seasonal Pride and Festival partiers. It's not perfect, but there is beautiful public art, mobile soup kitchen, giant chess, some greenery. Last night for the Drag Stars show the stage and sound were great, but I don't get why they needed to fence us in, doesn't seem to be necessary at the outdoor stages during Jazz Fest - maybe it's just that the areas where you can buy and carry beers are so much bigger then? Anyway, it was way too crowded last night, it was fun but kind of scary and I left before I wanted to. I'd like to see the city do a better job with opening up this park out onto St Catherines and maybe the streets around during big events so there is better flow."
"This park is a super fun place to get a drink or bite to eat while wandering around Montreal. At night there's live music, and there are various gardens and childrens' activity areas. The fountains also provide constant entertainment for kids as well as adults. The eating and drinking and stage part of the park is wheelchair accessible, as several of the patrons enjoying the place were using powered wheel chairs (not just racing chairs that can pop a wheeley to get over small steps). However, the grassy slope area is likely less friendly to wheels. It's a very social and fun environment. There's security in the evening to keep it family friendly, but they are just as customer-service oriented as the bartenders - friendly and calm, just making sure alcohol stays in designated locations and those who get too intoxicated don't disrupt the fun. The Dark & Stormy cocktail was shockingly good, for what is usually a simple cocktail. The sangria tasted very orange-juice-y, and fell a bit flat - I split both drinks with a friend, and we both agreed. They have lots of other fun looking cocktails and food. ¬†I'm so glad we wandered across it and will definitely make a point to find my way back if I visit Montreal again!"
"Nice place to chill out in the middle of the city center! Free and good wifi, small bar/cafe/resto, music, people chilling around, and ""eco"" look and feel. Perfect to rest a little bit in the middle of a day of city exploration."
"This open park area in the city is one of the most amazing examples of why Canada is such an appealing place culturally and socially. I have never seen so many happy and carefree people in my life. My cab driver from Moldova, ""If you walk home at 4am in Moldova, you probably won't make it home with your $400 jacket or your iPhone. Not so in Montreal. Nobody will bother you here."""
"This park is nice and big and right at the beginning of the gay village. Its a really good spot in the summer to hang out and people watch.During pride, it turns into part central with huge dances and shows, which are usually free (or $2 donation). Theres lots of homeless people around and people selling/doing drugs - but this is right downtown and theres a couple homeless shelters around. They usually just ask for money and if you say no then thats it. I've been going to this park since I was 14, and I've never had trouble. Theres also lots of cops around this park, so it should be all good."
A great place for a good coffeee! Check out the live bands or Salsa nights!
"I love hiking and luckily my wife and kid also love hiking so we were thrilled finally warm weather had arrived to Montreal. We had an amazing sunny weekend and we needed a good hike. I open google maps and started to look for close parks we never visited before. This park is less than an hour drive, so close and looked so promising.Well it delivered everything it promised. If you are into bird watching this is perfect for you. If you want to see other type of wild life (we sae deer's, snakes, beavers, turtles, racoons, field mice...so many creatures) its a must for you and if you just want to experience nature with its great trails and views...perfect.The admission is very low (less than 6$ per person), there is free parking, nice coffee shop and the entrance and a cool playground about 1 Km into the trail. Also cool geocaches if you are into it. A wonderful place for the entire family, they dont accept dogs but with all the animals I understand."
"This is a cool monument to the old Olympic Park. ¬†I think Montreal was one of the only cities (if not THE only) to design their Olympic facilities with the future in mind. ¬†This park still has museums, attractions, and a public sports facility open to all residents. ¬†They reused all of the buildings for something and they are open to the public now. ¬†There's also a ton of green space and areas for picnics, walks, sitting, etc. ¬†Really, Montreal thought the Olympic thing through and got the most out of what they built for it. ¬†It's easy to bike here or take the train and there's tons of bike parking and there's a BIXI station right on the grounds so you can rent and park. ¬†There's a fair amount of things to do here and other attractions nearby so you can fill an afternoon visiting. ¬†I highly recommend, especially if you want to learn about the Olympics or the Expos (les Expos nous manque!)."
"I've always admired Olympic Stadium and came here often back in the days of the Expos. ¬†I enjoyed the architecture and liked taking the funicular up to the top of the tower.A few years ago I was here and went to the bio dome, which was cool.But Olympic Stadium itself is very down at the heels. ¬†When visiting recently for a Pirates-Blue Jays game, you could see how there were a lot of repairs that were needed and pieces of the stadium were being held together with wood and nails. ¬† The outside is a bit removed from it's former majestic stance.Inside, it's also helplessly outdated compared to newer stadiums. ¬†It stunk that the concessions on the upper level could only take cash, which led to long lines at the ATM. ¬†Also, the limited options (hot dogs, chips, sad poutine and even sadder pizza) were not appetizing. ¬† Also, why could you only get Bud or Bud Light ? ¬†Am I in Canada or St. Louis?The sound system is bad, the lighting is not great and the scoreboards are seriously outdated, so this could place could never hope to house a major league team in any sport. ¬†But I still have a soft spot for it.Although I like it, it would probably be for the best if they tore it down and built something new."
Beautiful and very close to the Botanical Garden. ¬†It's so cool to imagine what the Olympics were like here. Good exhibit.
"Went to see the ""Saluons 40 Ans de Grands Evenements""A great concert. One thing that you got to know, the concert was free. If is free go early."
"Ginormous amount of land with an Olympic landmark that is crumbling down due to poor infrastructure. Hmm. It's definitely worth dropping by via CAR if you are a tourist along with a list with the other activities around the area- Biodome, Botancial Gardens, insectarium. There are always activities going on in the area- like food trucks line up for the first Friday of every month- anything special? no- but fun considering street food isnt as popular in the 514. Save the 3.75$ on the commute here and get a post card of the Olympic stadium if you are really keen!"
"I put up a few photos of Montreal's Parc Olympique, the Olympic Park, and I was prompted to write a review. ¬†I thought I already had. ¬†I had actually reviewed venues within it, such as the Inclined Tower and the Biodome. ¬†The reality is that Parc Olympique features even more than these two venues ... quite a bit more. ¬†First of all, it's a park covering an extensive area in a quadrant of Montreal bounded by four major streets. ¬†Then, in addition to the tower and the Biodome is its centerpiece, the stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes football team, but also previously home to the Montreal Expos baseball team. ¬† ¬†The other thing to note is that there is a Sports Centre (Canadian spelling), which includes the natatorium used in the Olympics when they were hosted here, as well as a gymnasium and even a sports therapy center. ¬†Montreal wasn't going to let these sit as monuments. ¬†Instead, they generate revenue. ¬†The general public can use the Sports Centre to swim and exercise, though I don't know how much that costs.Getting to the Parc Olympique is easy. ¬†It's really the only major attraction quite a ways east of Centre-Ville and the Metro can get you there. ¬†The stations to use are Viau and Pie IX, and they are on the Green Line in the direction of the Honore Beaugrand terminus. ¬†Getting to the Parc Olympique by car is also doable. ¬†One just needs to follow Sherbrooke eastward from Centre-Ville and the 60 story angled tower and stadium will readily announce when you have arrived. ¬†Parking is expensive, and I have found that patience, reading neighborhood parking signs (only in French), and some distance may reward one with a free parking space on the street, based on the times that I have driven to the complex.The thing that is most striking about the complex is how complex it is. ¬†I'm referring to all the curves and swoops built out of reinforced concrete. ¬†It is amazing and awe inspiring. ¬†Hearing of the budget overruns, however, is shocking. ¬†In various visits to the Parc Olympique, I have been to the top of the Inclined Tower twice and to the Biodome once. ¬†At other times, it's just a great place and space to walk around and see the complex, and all the ramps and plazas around it. ¬†Hoodlums on skateboards seems to think so, too. ¬†One of the Metro stations is tucked underneath one corner of the complex, or so it seems. ¬†In terms of pricing, the attractions are predictably in the mid-range, can be grouped into packages of 2 or 3 venues, and the AAA/CAA card can help knock off a few dollars.As for demerits, there are a few. ¬†Be careful when walking on the grass, let alone sitting on the grass. ¬†It's Canada, meaning there are Canadian geese. ¬†Use your imagination. ¬†Also, at times, the complex looks a little desolate and, in some spots, you will encounter graffiti and reinforced concrete that is spalling. ¬†It's a little long in the tooth, so I'm sure it requires a lot of upkeep.Lastly, note that Montreal's botanical garden and insectarium are across the street. ¬†I always sort of shined on the idea of the city's botanical garden, but I eventually learned that it is actually very nice, both in terms of its contents and its tranquility, and worth visiting at least once. ¬†Given that this is 2016, this means it's the 40th anniversary of the Parc Olympique. ¬†It hosted the 1976 Olympics, when Montreal was experiencing rapid growth, the metro area had two major airports, and I'm sure that the complex, looking both avant garde and spic and span at the same time, was quite a sight. ¬†It still is and it's worthy of nothing less than 4 stars. ¬†Every trip to Montreal has included a visit to the Parc Olympique, even if just to look at it, walk around, and take photos."
"This is always a perfect stop for photos while heading to the Botanical Gardens which is across the street. This is the site of the 1964 Olympics; the rather avant-garde building houses the stadium and is a major attraction which can be toured or you can elect to ride the cable car to the top for a 360 degree view of Montreal. There are several nice vantage points for photos of the the building, stadium and Olympic grounds."
We decided to make a day of going to Olympic park and check out a piece of Olympic history. The metro will leave you within walking distance. We were unable to access the indoor parts of the park since it was closed for an event which was a bummer. We did take a walk around the whole park and took in the historic significance of the 1976 games. The park is still amazing even though you can tell it hasn't been maintained in years but it's still a wonderful thing to experience. There is a large tower ride The Biodome and The Botanical gardens you can check out for a premium price.
"Went to see a baseball game here. The seats were far up but it was great view. The arena is big and spacious. I thought it was a bit confusing with all the different signs and numbers, but you get used to it. The food is ridiculously overpriced."
"It's hard to imagine that this Olympic Park was built in 1976 for the Summer Olympics since it was still in great condition. ¬†It is now turned into a tourist attraction- Biodome, Insectarium, and Planetarium. ¬†If my hotel was not located right next to it, I doubt I would venture there, but I'm glad I did.My friends and I did not go into any of the buildings, but walked around instead. ¬†We saw a whole bunch of people standing by the ramp of the Olympic Stadium and was told that the first Friday of every month, they have a street food festival with food trucks so we checked it out. ¬†There were plenty of food trucks with amazing food. ¬†I was surprised at how organized this was compared to the food truckeroo back home in Washington D.C.If I return to Montreal, I'd like to check out the tower and Biodome."
Visited Montreal on a long weekend from Philadelphia one of the first things we did was the stadium tour with Jeff after the Funicular ride. It was amazing. Jeff was so much fun to hang out with. He's definitely an expert. In fact he told us things about philly and Pennsylvania that we didn't know. He went above and beyond to personalize our experience and gave us suggestions for the rest of our stay in Montreal. Do yourself a favor and book this tour especially if you buy a Montreal pass. Plus he's witty as hell
"I loved coming to Olympic Stadium when the Montreal Expos played baseball here. ¬†Alas, they no longer do. ¬†In fact, the team no longer exists either. ¬†Sorry, but the Washington Nationals are NOT the Expos!Anyways, Olympic Stadium and the Montreal Tower situated right beside the Stadium are iconic symbols of this beautiful city in my humble opinion.If you are a tourist, then I highly recommend visiting here. ¬†There may even be an event or concert you would like to attend at the time of your visit. ¬†At the very least, you can take awesome pics of the unique stadium architecture and the tower! ¬†Won't see anything like it in the world!"
"Big open space, with nothing going on. The Biosphere and the other museum type things would be good for families with kids, but the ticket prices seemed high.Unless you're some kind of rabid Olympics fan, or want to visit the Sports Medicine clinic, this one, you could probably skip."
"E.T. phone home! Apparently it's ride was hanging out in Montreal all along. Am I the only one who thought Le Stade Olympique looks like a vintage spaceship? As a rainy day activity, everyone else took shelter in the Biodome. We braved the torrential downpour and explored the grounds. Besides the area between the Biodome and the main stadium, take your camera and head straight towards the Olympic rings on Sherbrooke and Pie-IX. Overall, I agree Parc Olympique could use some TLC to bring the area into the 21st century. I'd skip the observation tower and reserve that for the overlook at Mont Royal."
"The Olympic Park is easily accessible by bus or train. ¬†There is a lot of construction in the area. ¬†The Biodome and Insectarium are both closed. ¬†The Biodome reopens in December 2019, but the Insectarium is closed until 2021. ¬† It is still a nice area to visit and experience the stadium or the tower. ¬†Visited on a Friday evening and was surprised to see all the food trucks."
"Easily accessible by M√©tro though there is a bit of a walk from the station, the Stade is a piece of Olympic history. In 1976, the Games of the XXI Olympiad were spectacular and Montreal is proud to have hosted them. The Olympic park is still here and available not only for tours but also for large events - the stadia regularly have futbal games, the arena has large concerts and sporting matches. And the massive pool is in near constant use.Though it wasn't complete at the time, the big tower is now open and you can ride the inclined Tower for a fab view of Montreal and the surrounding area. Spend a few extra bucks for the guided tour of the facility and get access to some special areas that you wouldn't ordinarily see.Don't miss the flags of the nations that won Gold medals at the Games. Where else will you see a Soviet ""hammer and sickle"" still flying?#2200"
"We visited the Olympic Park while staying in Montreal and took the guided tour. ¬†I know that many of the reviews speak about nothing much to see and the place not being well maintained. ¬†That is just not the case. ¬†First all of all the facilities are being used by a variety of different sports teams and other events. ¬†The pool is open to the public and in use almost all of the time.There are a few exhibits, but the thing to see is the actual stadium and pool. ¬†They are both quite impressive. ¬†Standing in the field of the stadium is awesome. ¬†I would recommend the guided tour--very good."
"We came here for a Blue Jays exhibition game. Our seats were in the 300-level, and we had a garbagey time finding them. No one was there to offer directions, and the range numbering isn't as intuitive as some other stadiums we've been to.Paid $20 for two short beers. But you know, stadiums. You get what you get.Getting in and out by train is a hot mess, so I suggest planning to have a drink in the area before you rush to get back on the Metro."
Wonderful!Our tour guide Jeffrey was so kind and knowledgeable and the facility was beautiful and it was so incredible to see the current Olympic teams still using the pools and fields!
"The Concept and design is beautiful but it's clear that this place has not been maintained since its heyday decades ago. The iconic leaning tower over the stadium has layers of paint peeling off. The grounds have dumpsters prominently displayed. It's kind of sad. The nice thing is that the Biodome is nice and the elevator to the top of the tower still works. Make sure you stop at the northwest corner of the Park, where there is a picture perfect opportunity with the torch, Olympic sign, and the stadium/ tower in the back."
"If you care at all about architecture or the Olympics, it's probably worth taking a trip to the Pie-IX station and wandering around outside the stadium. It's a big, open, peaceful place to just take a walk when there's nothing going on. Sometimes there's schoolkids just hanging out or skateboarding. It's no place to spend the day, but it's worth seeing."
"Saw AC/DC with my family. We had floor seats and the sound and view was terrible. We could barely hear what he was singing, sometimes I couldn't even tell which song it was because the sound was so off. That being said, I still managed to enjoy the concert, I mean it's AC/DC man!! But next time I would try to get seats in the stands rather than the floor. And as others have said, avoid using the bathrooms if you can. We waited a good 20 minutes or more for the women's bathroom. There were huge lines on either side for a grand total of FIVE stalls."
"My fiance and I came here while we were staying in downtown Montreal for the first time. We took the Metro to get here (which is nearby). The building is just very interesting and quite unique. Definitely not something I've ever seen that would look remotely similar. There were other tourists walking around here like us. Nothing else really going on here except for the opportunity to ride the elevator all the way up to the observatory. But my fiance and I were too cheap to fork over the $15 (Canadian dollars) per person. Overall, glad we ended up stopping by here since it is a well known landmark in Montreal (it was our first visit here so we had to do the touristy thing)."
This whole area is VERY outdated. ¬†The trails are beat up and surrounded by fencing. ¬†The pool area looks like it has turned into a gym? It's just so depressing to see another olympic area around the world being so desolate. ¬†I'm starting to be glad that Houston has not yet won an olympics.
"I felt very honored to be an attendant to the France vs. Germany women's world cup soccer game. Although France didn't win to play against USA, it was quite memorable being in this stadium. I knocked off a star due to the staff not mentioning our seats were the exact opposite of where we entered. We had to walk all the way through the crowd but at least we were able to view the game while walking. There were a lot of people in attendance and many surrounding us were very loud and fanatical but it made the experience all the worthwhile. I was happy my then bf purchased these tickets while on our montreal trip. I would definitely attend another game here if I'm ever visiting Montreal again. I hope again soon."
"I tried to imagine Olympic Park as it was when it hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics. ¬†I imagined it to be bustling with activity, filled with athletes and spectators from all over the world who came to participate in an historical sporting event. ¬†In my mind, there was an energy in the air that you could almost touch. ¬†Of course, I wasn't even there, so my assumptions are based exclusively on what I see happening when I watch the Olympics of today; the Michael Phelps era of Olympic history. ¬†Fast forward to 2012, the Phelps era, and a stroll around Olympic Park will make you feel as if you are wandering through a post-apocalyptic wasteland on some far away planet, light years away from its former 1976 Olympic glory. ¬†From what I've read, the construction and planning of Olympic Park was a nightmare before it even started. ¬†Tons of delays, poor budgeting, massive amounts of debt and sub par construction techniques all marred what is actually a pretty awesome looking group of facilities. ¬†As dilapidated as it is, I think it is really cool. ¬†It's futuristic and extremely dated, an eyesore and a masterpiece, historical and irrelevant - a truly fascinating place. ¬†We took a guided tour which brought us to many of the main sites of the park, including Olympic Stadium (former home of the Expos) and the Olympic pool. ¬†I believe the tour lasted just under one hour. ¬†We also went up to the Montreal Tower observation deck for some amazing views. ¬†We skipped the Bio-dome, unfortunately. ¬†We just didn't have time to check it out. ¬†All of the things we did at Olympic Park were worth it, but for me, the best part of it was when I was able to tune out the tour guide and imagine what this place used to be like and how it became what it is today. ¬†I'm just happy that no pieces of concrete collapsed on me in the process."
"Recent visit on Labor Day 2009 weekend with my dear mother on a tour bus group. ¬†We had a grand tour of the stadium lead by a stadium employee, Felix who is very informative to describe the history of the building's structure erection, trivia of the history, including the famed August 8, 1992 riots after Axl Rose and Metallica frontman James Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his left arm after stepping too close to a pyrotechnics blast during the opening of ""Fade to Black."" ¬†en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu‚Ä¶Our Olympic Stadium tour guide employee, Felix shown samples of the artifical grass that once home team Expos played. ¬†He did host a question/answer forum, which as a Canto Chigga, I've impressed him with my knowledge (coming from a long standing background with a former love's avid baseball fanatic passion) the former Montreal Expos and their mascot Youppi. ¬†I highly recommend a guided tour of Olympic Stadium, the staff speaks English as well as French!I rate Olympic Stadium four stars as signs of age is visible with structrual problems. ¬†en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo‚Ä¶"
"Never had the chance to see the Expos play, but I did go on a tour here, and I have to say, it is an interesting stadium to say the least. There is so much history that has taken place here, such as the 1976 Summer Olympics, that I envisioned myself back in time. Our tour guide gave us an overview of not only Montreal baseball, but he told us that the stadium is still in use for, you guessed it, all types of expos and event."
"The Olympic Stadium (Stade olympique) is a multi-purpose stadium built as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics. ¬†It subsequently became the home of Montreal's professional baseball and Canadian football teams. Since the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2004), the stadium has had no main tenant, and with a history of financial and structural problems, is largely seen as a white elephant. ¬†It currently serves as a 56,040-seat multipurpose facility for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) during non-winter months, and continues to serve as a venue for Grey Cup games hosted by the Montreal Alouettes (Canadian Football League).I was a HUGE Montreal Expos fan. ¬†Maybe it was my ""closet Canadian"" inclination or maybe it was that cute red, white and blue M, but there wasn't a day during multiple baseball seasons that I didn't keep track of how my beloved Les Expos were doing. ¬†I even had a Montreal Expos jacket for several years and there's still a penant on my wall at home.I also had the opportunity to attend at least a few games in Olympic Stadium and I was never really impressed. ¬†It reminded me a lot of the Metrodome in Minneapolis. ¬†But with my team loyalty, it really didn't matter.So...5 stars for the Team2 stars for the Stadium1 star for Major League Baseball for allowing the team to tank."
"Sad to say, this place looks pretty run down. Just walking around the stadium, it was obvious that it was not well maintained. The only sign of life you see around the place are tourists that stop in to ride the elevator up to the Montreal Tower Observatory. The ride itself costs $15 CAD. I was not going to pay for something like that. (Go to St. Joseph's Oratory for a better view that costs nothing.)In the end, is this a must see? No. Stadiums are not interesting unless there is an event scheduled."
"I have attended several events here over the years (Expos games, car shows, Black and Blue) and the Olympic Stadium has never disappointed. I also saw Madonna here in 1992 for her ""Girlie Show"" and even though that was super spectacular, the acustics here are not the best.Yes it is an old monstrosity, and I saw some water dripping in places. The roof does not open anymore (poor design). But overall I like looking at it from a distance, as it is spectacular looking. Another good thing is that the Metro is connected to it, so it is very assessable to downtown."
Just watched One Direction with daughter. ¬† Great act but stadium very loud compared to Rogers Centre. ¬† Maybe the fans?! ¬† Food good. ¬†Seating ok. ¬†Not enough washrooms for sure!!!! Great access to metro to downtown hotel. ¬†Too many people to actually visit site.
"This visit was disappointing, to be truthful. As excited as I was to be on the stomping grounds of the 1976 Olympics, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of, well, excitement. The entire place seemed desolate and abandoned, and while I tried hard to imagine what it must have been like during the Olympics, I just couldn't get passed the eerie silence that enveloped the entire attraction. What blew my mind, too, were the prices to do anything here! My friend and I were able to get student tickets that brought us to the top of the tower, but it was not worth it...at all. While you could see all of Montreal from the top, I couldn't enjoy it completely because I was so agitated for spending so much money on nothing.If you do visit the Parc Olympique, go into it with an open and very creative mind. I would suggest that you don't spend the money on going to the top of the tower. Walking through the park would be quite enough."
"Like a 60s architectural icon from space this place is a bizarre mix of dusty, cavernous, vintage and Barbarella-style futuristic. It's labyrinthine and difficult to navigate and designed to suddenly lead you up to views of... pretty much nothing. The fact that it's crumbling is just a bonus!"
"Place is a rip off. 16$ to park. 23$ per person, base, to go to tower. Stay away. Saving grace was being able to swim in the Olympic pool (have to pay), but all that did was save this trip to the stadium from being a total waste."
The venue is okay. Went to a concert here yesterday. The staffs are friendly. Two bottles of water asked for 8.50 dollars
"November - very cold. Made walking around roughDid biodome, insectarium and indoor botanical gardens while there but this review is for the whole park not those specific attractions.This place is under construction which makes it even harder and colder to get from place to place. It has a very run down feel to it. The tower is expensive on its own 15$ a person or so. Couldn't justify going to the top just for a view of a city not really known for its skyline...It's free and it's cool to see how much money was put into hosting the Olympics but there's not a ton here outside of the biodome experience which is awesome."
"Hopped on the subway to head over to check out the Olympic Stadium that was built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Unfortunately, today was cloudy and rainy so it wasn't worth the money to head to the tower to get a view of Montreal, but we walked around part of the perimeter. The Stadium is one big structure of pure concrete with a tall Tower. To me, not quite architectural beautiful, but I guess it was quite the building back in the 70's.Not much else to see or do here on a non-event day. Walked into the swimming stadium which looks like it has turned into a gym. There's an exercise room, 3 pools and a wading pool.Overall, cool to see and think that you're standing where the Olympics used to take place but if you're not into nostalgia, then I'd skip this site."
"Total crap venue. I think they are still serving the same pizza from when it opened in the 70s. The whole place smells of burnt pizza and it looks worse than it smells. They also had a strange rule where they had to pour all of the beers into cups and, naturally, no one at the stadium really knew how to properly pour a beer into a cup. This alone caused lines to get out of control. Prices were terrible too. Only good things about it was that it is on the metro line and that they have a cover for the whole stadium."
"The architecture is really impressive! I really enjoyed walking through this amazing space, my only problem with it is that I got lost a couple of times, they need to signalize the things a bit better."
"Parc Olympique is exactly the type of attraction you do to say you've done it...but isn't entirely memorable. ¬†The view from the top of the Tower is pretty amazing--you can see the entire city from all sides. ¬†However, there's not much else to do. ¬†Frankly, it was also a little confusing once we got off the Metro. ¬†While we were there during the off-season (April), there aren't any signs or indications of what all of the buildings are until you walk in. ¬†We bought the combined ticket which granted us access to the Tower and the planetarium. ¬†I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this; just do the Tower. ¬†All in all, it was kind of upsetting to see how not much is left of the area and to see the aftermath of the Olympics leaving town."
"I may be biased because I was a big Expos fan (yes, we existed... in small numbers) but I love the Olympique Stadium.Although I understand that it put my fair city into a large debt, and continues to burden us financially due to numerous roof problems amongst others, there are some aspects of it that you can admire.1. It is a beautiful building: How many buildings in the world do you know that look anything like it? Even with it's age, architecturally, it's one of my favorite buildings I've seen, including in my travels (the outside of it at least)2. The memories: There were times when it was used for important events. I still remember going to baseball games with my father when I was young. I remember the first and last game of the Expos last season where the entire stadium was sold out. I've also heard of concerts by legendary bands Rolling Stones playing there. And even today, sporting events like the Under 20 FIFA World Cup and Montreal Alouettes games can be a great time and great memories for the future.So next time, you throw more money at the city, remember, at least you have the memories (always think of the positives)."
You have to go see this futuristic stadium just because everything around is such a train wreck. The concrete plaza surrounding the structure makes you want to cut your wrists. You won't regret going just because of the strangeness of it all.
"Despite all of the criticisms and complaints I have enjoyed every trip I have made to Montreal's Olympic Stadium.I went in: - 1998: To sightsee and ride the elevator to the top of the tower. - 2003: To view a Montreal Expos home game against the LA Dodgers, buying super close field level seats, and receiving Eric Gagne's (hometown boy) autograph - 2009: While finishing the Montreal Marathon (Marathon Oasis de Montr√©al)All were fond memories.Yes, I am aware that the construction of this stadium has been a financial and structural nightmare for the city. ¬†I can't believe an architect thought up a kevlar roof. ¬†Great idea, genius. ¬†When the roof is on, the field in not so great, with its artificial turf and poor lighting.I wasn't alive to remember the 1976 Olympic Summer Games, so whenever I see this structure, I am saddened and reminded of the city's loss of its not-so-beloved baseball team. ¬†I was a fan of the Expos and really do feel that the 1994 MLB strike and the city's unwillingness to build a new stadium did the team in. ¬†I miss you Youppi!en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol‚Ä¶en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo‚Ä¶en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo‚Ä¶"
"One of my favorite tourist destinations in the entire city! Great views from atop the observatory, awesome walk through the biodome, plus I had the opportunity to swim in the olympic pool and jump off the diving boards the last time I was there. Great place to bring your family, but be prepared to pay for everything!"
"What a legacy! ¬†An amazing architectural icon, activity centre and biodome."
"I was just here for the LA Galaxy v. Impact match as a traveling LA fan. The entire Olympic park is what I would think a North Korean monument would look like. It is cold, sterile, run down and looks like what people in 1976 thought the year 2000 was going to look like.....As for the inside of the stadium...you have one option for beer and it's an import...wait for it....COORS LIGHT (WTF). ¬†The food options are hot dogs, or poutine, the water comes in soda cups with lids and there is a black sheet hanging on one side of the stadium to cover something up. This stadium does not reflect the city at all, but I would not go out of my way to visit the stadium unless I am going to watch a specific team. There are 2 metro stops in the park, so that is a major plus."
"Love this park !Even tho I'm not a kid the park still has picini table to chill out at, picnic or ice cream.If you do have kids note that this park has the water park thats perfect for hot summer days. There's water fountain as well so don't worry you'll be fine out there.Park closes at 11 and that means the water turns off as well, so there's no sneaking in after hours for a late night soak lol.Love this spot"
"Such a massive park! We have our annual our Respiratory Therapy department BBQ here. Every August, a Saturday, we come super early to reserve the BBQ spot. Plenty of parking spots, tons of picnic tables. We bring tons of food, drinks and games... and make perfect day of it! Rain or Shine... we go on. If it rains, we got ourselves covered by a tarp. It rained once, one year, and we were holding the tarp over our heads... it was awesome! A perfect spot to picnic with family, colleagues and friends!"
Best park for a family and friends gathering with bbq. Also there is a kids play area and it is a relaxing atmosphere
"Huge park with lots of plain air and space for picnic. But it doesn't have slides, ¬†playgrounds and other amusements, you have to bring your toys."
"Very beautiful and peaceful place, great for hiking, biking,BBQ, and for any great outdoors. Conveniently located near Angrignon metro."
"This is a great urban park that has suffered in the recent economy and been forced to shutter a few of the more unique but costly activities ie; the little farm / petting zoo area where we used to take the camp kids, and the old Fort. Still you're looking at over 200 acres of land, mostly forest, and hundreds of community garden plots. Here recently for the inspiring and humbling Walk So Kids Can Talk I got a quick ATV tour of the park limits, including the big bordering streets (oh my!) and enjoyed the 5km walk past ponds, sweeping willows, meditative tai chi groups, and the incredibly convenient metro stop that drops you off sweetly right at the park's grassy doorstep. It made me feel glad to live in a city where bits of green space are still cherished by local residents and protected by the powers that be, I hope that remains the case even in the face of economic change and challenges. Note that this area, especially around the metro, is a little barren in terms of local business, and not always safe at night."
This garden is a little hide away from the main road to the main building. It was really cool down walk from the heat since there were a lot of trees in here. 18 sculptures tell the story of Jesus.
"I biked from The Old Port to the Atwater Market and I had a great time! The route is very scenic even beautiful at times. There's plenty of path to visit, almost 15 KMs worth of it and its of good quality. The route is urban but surrounded by trees and buildings that went the extra length to be visually appeasing. Very cultural activity if you want to explore Montreal.Most of the terrain is flat with some hills, nothing too difficult. Several maps to check where you're located and a lot of stops to enjoy your time, take a breath and so forth.You can walk it, jog it, run it. I went with the healthy activity of renting a bike for a few hours. Grabbed food from Atwater market and had a picnic. What a wonderful place and worth for activity visitors from out of town to visit and locals willing to explore their city."
"I am here to review the Lachine Canal bike path. It is glorious! Starting in Old Montreal the path is both adventurous and easy to follow, you can bike it all the way to the western tip of the island I think, but even staying along the Canal throughout Lachine you feel how the city changes. Passing from tight condos into the big public parks along the water's edge feels amazing, and the best pay off is turning around because there is a slight incline while heading west so they way back is smoooth sailing!!"
"I love the stretch of the Canal between the Old Port and Rene Levesque Park. Specifically, I love the bike path and the parks along this stretch. Great for biking (by me) and running (my partner). Hanging out near the Atwater market or the Old Port on a nice weekend day is pretty wonderful too. Collectively, this represents a big part of our ""easy access"" leisure within Montreal and we cherish living nearby. There have been times where construction along the Canal bike path have impacted our enjoyment of this resource - but most of this is complete now. Yay! Highly recommend spending time around here!!!"
"What can I say other than that this is a great place to jog, bike, walk, and sight see!Of course, I'm only talking about the summer version. You definitely don't wanna be here when it's winter.The paths goes on for miles so you won't run out of length."
"Chop chop chop. Parks canada has been repairing the canal walls for 2 years now at great cost. The charm of the area has been lost. The landscaping consists of little hillocks with lawn and saplings grouped together in select areas. Most of the bike path is denuded and any interesting attributes are removed. There are no gardens or meadows left. Birds and bees are gone. It is not environmentally friendly. ¬†The paths are very wide to allow for multi users making the path hot during peak summer season. It us also bitterly cold as we are not protwcted against winter winds. The residents were ""consulted"" but our suggestions were completely ignored. This is not Parks Canada at its best...i am truly disappointed. I am now going to cycle in more beatiful parks that are available like the petit train du nord, ilse de boucherville and chambly."
"During our scooter tour, we had some time cruising along this canal. Very pretty scenery. It reminded me of all the HGTV House Hunters I've watched that take place in Amsterdam and the outlying countryside. The bike/walking path that travels along the canal is a big plus. Bikes, bikes, bikes, runners, walkers, gazers, you get the idea. The Canal was made by the first colonizers in Montreal as a way to claim the land from the native Indians who ran the land. Very cool history - read or visit for more in depth history! You get views of the entire downtown Montreal from a few points and cool glimpses into the Montreal way of life."
"So Beautiful! I started biking from Old Port till Parc Rene-Levesque, and it's just amazing view! Beautiful bridges, and the biking route is surrounded by trees, flowers, and the canal, just beautiful! I took the wrong turns a couple of times, but in general once you follow the other cyclists you should be fine! I usually dont bike for so long, but it's not that tough, its pretty flat, other than some steep roads once in a while but that's it. There's tons of stops along the way, and maps that show you were you are in case you wanna see how long you've biked/walked and basically motivates you! If you don't have a bike yourself, you could rent a bike, and even if there's a problem with your own bike, in Ma Bicyclette they repair bikes, or you could pump the wheels if you need it. There's also a few restrooms on the way, and it's just a great way to spend a couple of hours: healthy, pretty view, nice spots to get drinks(i.e. St-Ambroise Terrace for beer, or Rosi Panini for sandwiches) and just beautiful parcs along the way! It's also nice to discover Montreal more, and there's a kayak place where you can rent kayaks if you want, so much to do along the way in the canal!"
"While this may not be as scenic as Old Port or have as many attractions, this is a great place for a walk, jog, or bike ride. ¬†There is a bike path that goes around the entire canal, and the it's not on the road either. It's actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water, so you can bike at a leisurely pace. ¬†In addition, along most of the canal is green space, so if you are tired, you can sit on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.All in all, maybe not an attraction for everyone, but it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city."
I ran here! Loved the walk here and jog. You can literally explore all of Old Montreal by running through here and along the water and into the little streets. Such a great running path!
"Every city needs a wonderful biking trail. ¬†Canal Lachine is an excellent paved bike path where you can get out be in in nature and enjoy the great outdoors. For me I haven't come here in winter so my experience is only in spring summer and fall. ¬†A fantastic place to go for a bike ride or walk or enjoy the outdoors along the canal. Typically I start just off 32nd ave in Lachine and you can make your way through Lasalle and then pretty much all the way to Old Montreal if you are full of energy. There are fantastic places to stop off along the way for breaks along the river. Bring a picnic in a nap sack or bag, discover different neighbourhoods and enjoy the great Montreal weather as Summer is short in the north. Typically the bike path can be somewhat busy on the weekends but people (from what I've experienced) respect a certain level of etiquette."
"I biked along and it's a great 2 hour summer activity! The shade from the trees, proximity to water, wind in your hair...It is also fun to watch the rollerbladers and other less conventional transportation."
I came here with my family on Christmas since most things in the city are closed. So glad we decided to take a walk along this canal!! It's really beautiful. There is a walking path and a separate bike path along both sides of the canal. There are placards along the canal describing the history of the area. It's a really lovely walk that I can't recommend enough.
"The Lachine Canal is a great place to be if you're a runner, walker or cyclist. ¬†As a runner this is my favourite spot to come for a good, long run. ¬†The path is 14.5 km long which is ideal if you're looking to cover a long distance and not have to be always stopping for traffic lights or looking out for cars. ¬† If you're in the Atwater Market area then you should consider picking up some food and having a picnic along the Canal"
"This must be one of the nicest parcs in the city it runs along the Lachine Canal from old Montreal to the old Lachine village. As I use to work in old Montreal and live in Point-Saint-Charles, I would ride my bike to work along the the canal bike path from the month of March until the first snow. Theres nothing like riding home on a sunny friday afternoon after a long week, talk about stress relief. The canal also has green space on either side of the bike path allowing for people to sit and enjoy the views of the city and take in sum sun. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the best places for a picnic, with it's proximity to the Atwater market it's easy to run over grab some bread and cheese, find a quiet spot and enjoy a nice quiet lunch.My only complaint, if you can even call this a complait is that the parc is all but closed in the winter, it would be nice if the bike path was maintained in the winter. I'm sure people would use it to comute all winter long, it might also be nice if cross-country ski tracks would be set ove the 14km length. It,s not a complaint, It's a ""would be nice if"" Just get out and enjoy it, we're lucky to have this parc ."
"the birthplace of Canada's Industrial Revolution is now a long stretch of park lining a 14.5-km canal that's perfect for walking, running, and cycling"
"Lovely park to go for walk with dog or for snow play (e.g., build snowman) with kids. No playground or sports areas but another park nearby (Le Ber Park) nearby offers this in spades. So, collectively, these two parks satisfy almost all my family's local park needs. A local library and sports complex are with 500m of this park too!"
"Montreal's best kept National Park secret only minutes away from downtown Montreal and worth the trip. Park is accessible by ferry or car, and once there you can rent bikes or kayaks. Bike rentals are about $30 so if you bring your own, you will save some money. Check Park Entrance Fee, but I think it was about $8 per person and totally worth it. They do an excellent job of maintaining this park.Absolutely beautiful setting that one cannot believe is only minutes from Montreal.You can bike between the 3 islands, and there are beautiful quiet spots en route to picnic, or just relax in the hammocks. Their new welcome center is beautiful and a great stop for food, water, bathrooms ¬†or just AC.The bike and kayak rental is directly across.My only complaint here and at most national parks is WHY a country that loves the outdoors and animals - does not allow us to bring our dogs with us on the hike."
"First of all the ferry to the Boucherville Islands park is ridiculously cute and I love it. It's a small bike ferry, a short ride on the water over to a peaceful haven blowing with tall grasses. We biked here from out in Mile End so after a hectic ride through the city, arriving on this island was heaven. It's deeply peaceful and really really fun to ride around on, amazing bike paths rolling through quiet trees and protected, diverse nature. People are here fishing, walking, kayaking and generally relaxing. I didn't find any earth shattering views or anything like that, but a real sense of peace really close to the heart of the city."
Came to play frisbee golf. A great free course in a beautiful parc. Free parking too which is a bonus.
I went to the parc with friends on a day where the entrance was free. In the winter this parc isn't the most fabulous. I've been in the warmer months and there was much more to see and do. Great parc to spot Virginia deer.
"I was looking for a place I can take my son on his scooter to celebrate the summer, a place that I can also bring my dog and doesnt feel like you are in/near a city but has more of an outdoor flavor. This place was PERFECTThe trails are well kept, some picnic tables/area at the edges but most of the walk is lovely, filled with people but yet feels not crowded, great views to the river, lots of birds and lots of dogs (I love places like this). My son loved the riding experience, my dog loved the exercise and I loved the entire bundle. I am sure once the trees will become green again it will be even more amazing and they also have a verity of winter walking trails. Nature in the City"
Great for walks and exercise and the view and it's simple and pretty I've gone too many times to count! Honestly makes me enjoy it more that it's walking distance from where I live! People should totally go! I only wish ¬†the water was blue just like up north! But we are in the city after all not in the Laurentides!
"Had a great picnic with the family here. Nice big clean park filled with people walking, riding bikes, walking their dogs or like us having a picnic. Great to have this little corner of nature here in the east end. We will come back."
"We are so lucky to live walking distance from this park (in fact, it was part of the reason we chose to live in Ahuntsic). In summer and fall, there are lovely walking/running/biking trails beside a beautiful river. Near sunset, look out for the great blue herons and the night herons (bihoreaux) near the old moulin. It's also wonderful to head up near the dam and find a bench to watch the sun set over the river. There are lots of picnic tables and grassy spots to spread ¬†your picnic blanket.In winter there are groomed trails for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails. Check out the events that happen at the maison du parc -- we recently attended a moonlight ski which ended with a campfire and hot chocolate. Magical!"
"Ile de la visitation is a great nature getaway when you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are many great spots for a picnic, whether it be with friends, family or that special someone. The park provides many picnic tables but feel free to bring a cozy blanket! There's plenty of room to have a frisbee match or kick around a soccer ball. There's a wonderful bike path that goes through the park, so if you catch a sunny day, ditch the car and take your bike to this wonderful park! Depending the time of year, you will have the honour of seeing Canadian geese! They flock to the park around early spring. I visit every March to spend time with them. They are lovely creatures! You will of course see male and female mallard ducks, seagulls and other varieties of birds. If you're a bird lover, bring those binoculars and keep your eyes peeled! What makes this park spectacular, for me at least, is the fact that it's close to the water. There are certain parts where you could go fishing, others you can't. However, if fishing isn't your thing, it's nice to hangout near the water and watch the birds scout for fish. You'll enjoy squirrels and chipmunks scattering for nuts and seeds, especially during the autumn season. If you're lucky, you might even see a fox!"
"What an awesome spot to swim or to fish, Or go for a walk, or chillax if you wish Though with the fishing: we didn't catch any,The refreshing swim made up for it plentyAlthough people came over cutting us off on our spot It's not the park's fault that people lack manners a lot The view is spectacular and the water just rightIt's a beautiful spot for a little respite----------- Installment 18 poetry reviewsThis is the last little park along LaSalle Blvd, it's right before the border to Lachine so technically still LaSalle. The bike path goes right through it so it's a beautiful spot to stop for a bit. Features: - Picnic tables- Benches- Swinging bench- Courtyard type area- Bluff overlooking the water- Paths that lead down to the water in a coupla places- Water is calm near the shore but currents pick up about 10 ft in, approx. depth 4-5 ft of water, not much seaweed, lots of rocks"
This place went from what the heck ? To va va voom!The whole park was re done from the benches to the new walk ways.There's always activities in the park mostly in the summer you'll have concerts or bbq's.There used to be lots of kids skateboarding but the signs up say they can't anymore since the new park. But it does have perfect skateboarding Ramps Iol
"I am in love with this Dog Park. ¬†I came from NYC with my husband and 5 puns dog, we had tons of dog runs there , nub nothing as nice as this park.Lots of space for the dogs to run around. ¬†People are friendly and for the most part responsive towards their dogs. ¬†The park is clean and the grass is well taken care. Water is available.Small dogs are mixed with big dogs. ¬†I would like better if the small dogs had an gated area for themselves, but it is not that big of a deal. ¬†If the big dogs are friendly towards my little one, I can hang out there for a while, and if I see they are a bit more rough, I just leave."
"Yes this is a big park with lots of space to let your dogs run around. However this dog park needs to be better organized or regulated. Dog owners come and leave their dogs to run around without any oversight. We saw 15-20 dogs running around and only 5-6 people in the park. There needs to be a small dog sectioned off area. Our small puppy got attacked by an aggressive German Shepard who kept trampling on him and biting him. Thank god I was right near my pup and was able to wrestle him away after a few minutes. When we yelled whose german Shepard this was, No one would claim him. Someone told us it belongs to an old guy but he was nowhere in the park. Long story short- big park but beware of irresponsible dog owners with aggressive dogs because it is an off leash park."
"This is the best dog park I've been to! 10/10 would recommend. I've recently moved to Montreal, and, found this to be a nice haven for my dog. I was initially hesitant about all the big dogs that frequent the park, but what is truly great- most of the people who come here are regulars. All the owners you I've encountered are responsible and keep a good eye on their dogs. There is no separate area for small dogs but most of the small dogs come to the park from 3-4 (here's a tip for all the small dog owners)!"
A lack of snow removal in the park has allowed the snow to pile so high in some parts that i just saw a dog jump out of the park.
"Chalet du Mont-Royal or Mount Royal Chalet was the highlight of our visit to Mount Royal Park (Parc du Mont-Royal: yelp.com/biz/parc-du-mon‚Ä¶). I think any visitor to Montreal has to go see it. I'm not sure where else outdoors in Montreal has such beautiful, wide, sweeping views of the city. It's like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, but with less traffic and people, and better views.Mount Royal Chalet is located on Mount Royal, the small mountain in Montreal the city is named after. We took the long way to the chalet by hiking up the mountain from the west-side entry point at Pine Ave W and Peel St. The quickest and easiest way to get to the chalet is by parking in one of the lots off Remembrance Rd and walking up the Olmsted Trail from there. It's probably about a short 10-minute walk from the lots.The chalet, which opened in 1932, is home to what's called the Belvedere Kondiaronk. It's really the belvedere that's the main attraction here. It's spacious and has quite the overlook. It's large and faces southeast over the city. The vista is breathtaking, day or night. We came at sunset.The chalet itself, which is open daily 8am-8pm, offers Wi-Fi, food and drink, a gift shop, restrooms, and an information desk.If you're visiting Montreal and have never been to the Mount Royal Chalet, I definitely recommend checking it out. The small walk/hike is worth it."
"Phew, long walk to get up to this viewing point, you go up up up until you are above the skyscrapers of the only French speaking metropolitan outside of France. People looked at me and went - wow, will this guy Everest! Very cool city skyline view. You have to push to the front among all the tourist crowds a bit to get a clear frontal view, unless you are 7'8 tall. One of the best places in the city."
"Quite a hike to get up here especially from the southside of the park and especially when you are wearing snow boots in the winter. It is a beautiful view when you get up there but should be quite honest, it's nothing spectacular. As a tourist, I would do it just to say that I've been. There is a building here where you can buy coffee, tea, baked goods and use the bathroom. I bought the hot chocolate and it was absolutely disgusting. I was furious. Bathrooms were clean though."
"Kondiaronk Belvedere is one of the best touristic attractions in Montreal. Situated in the park of Mont Royal it offers gorgeous views south including downtown Montreal, Saint Lawrence river and even Mont Saint-Hilaire. The Chalet du Mont Royal located at the same spot is a beautiful building one should visit. It also has some important facilities such as coffee shop and bathrooms. The view point can be reached easily by car from Cote de Neige. Parking space is abundant and payed. Alternatively take the Rue Peel Steps, 15 to 20 minutes of climbing and you will be rewarded with beautiful sights. Must do during every season!"
Well worth the hike -- especially in the autumn. The view of the city is unbeatable from here. The reds and yellows really pop and walking through the trees while trekking up the mountain is an unforgettable experience. There is a crazy amount of construction these days though so be prepared for a slight detour when ascending the staircase!
I work nearby and this is the best place to eat your lunch on a sunny day (Like today! May 17 2017). Lots of clean benches to sit down with a friend and just eat and talk. I also just love people watching and just enjoying my lunch hour outside. I am very excited for the food trucks to arrive because I have a feeling I'll be there every day.
"A nice garden walk in the middle of the city. With a lot of trees, I feel refreshing after a walk here."
"The other half of the two parks here, Place Du Canada. Dorchester (officially, ""Dominion Square"") has more trees and benches compared to the other. And more monuments even though it's about 2/3 the size. Including one to the Boer War and one for Scottish poet Robert Burns.The park is open 24 hours and is a bit of a focal point for pedestrian traffic in the city. It's also well served by the Underground City."
"I visited this place twice during my trip to Montreal. ¬†It has ample benches, a few nice statues and plenty of grass for you to have picnics on. ¬†However since we are on Yelp now, there was one particular aspect I really liked and that was the fact that it has 3 food trucks (different depending on the day) located their between Monday to Friday and one food truck on weekends. ¬†There was one day where I ate from every food truck there. ¬†It was a great mix of unhealthy food, slightly less unhealthy Chinese food, and dessert (crepe). ¬†Having these food trucks located here is very convenient and makes for a great time.Overall, if I worked in the area, I would just sit here for lunch as it is nice and has some decent greenspace."
"I had brown-bag lunch with a friend here because it is close to where she worked and the hotel I was staying at. ¬†Even at lunch on a Friday in late August it seem really well kept, with lots of people enjoying the last of the sun and grass. ¬†Kids were running around and hardly noticed any trash, only a handful of the usual drunk people. ¬†If I worked around there I would be brown-bagging it too because how nice it is."
"This great parc is located right in front of the Sun Life buidling in between Peel and Metcalfe streets. Dorchester square holds a special place in my heart as I spent countless Friday and Saturday nights there drinking 40s as a youth before going out to any of the local bars or clubs nearby.The parc itself received a huge overhaul in the last year or so which has made it more accessible to normal folk and less accessible for drunks, hobos and drug dealers.Although we are approaching winter, this is still a great place to have a picnic, or just to sit on one of the many benches and enjoy the view of the many statues or buildings in the area. It's also a great place for people watching, for those who like that sort of thing! hehe"
"This is a beautiful park in Westmount and quieter than the always busy Westmount park as it is a bit off the beaten path (and you have to walk uphill to get to it). ¬†Set on a large sweeping hill with beautiful views of the city, it is a delightful setting for a picnic or just a quiet place to stretch out with a book. ¬†A friend told me it was modelled on the Primrose Hill park in London but I don't know if that's just urban myth. On the east side of the park about halfway up there is a nice playground for kids, and a bit further up near the top there is a small wading pool in the summer. ¬†There is also a dog park, tennis courts and soccer field at the top of the park. ¬†In winter, it's a great spot to take the little ones sledding."
"Quiet and hidden just how I like them.It's in the most beautiful part of westmount the type of area where the houses are ""ouuuu"" and ""ahhhh"" worthy.I decided to come for a picnic and didn't want to get stuck fighting for picnic tables in every other packed park. This place was just right, quiet and you have a great view from the bleacher.There's a few entrances to the park, I however came by the street and came down a little flight of cement stairs that lead us to a huge well maintained soccer field.There's 3 sets of bleachers 2-4 benches around the field as well as 2 benches under a gazebo. There's a water fountain to drink from ¬†right beside the gazebo as well as a huge deck area that has a look out of the rest of the park. At the look out you will notice a dog park to your left and a tennis court to the right there's stairs on either sides of the building to bring you to them."
"Guys there's nothing to see or do here in the winter right now, heads up. It's just some wooden rocking chairs and a wooden carousel mouldering under the snow near the market. Looking forward to seeing what they do with this space come spring 2015!"
"Lovely little park that has a separate play area for very little ones and for bigger ones, a gorgeous chalet that is wheelchair accessible and has a baby changing area and lots of shady areas and benches. ¬† ¬†Totally worth a visit with the kids ¬† :-)"
"Baldwin Park is one of my favorite neighborhood spots. I first discovered it while jogging, it's diagonal paths perfect for doing a few figure eights when I was trying to get a bit more time in before turning around to head home. ¬†Now with a young child we love to visit the playground and it's many different areas for different age groups. ¬†In particular we love that they have play structures that are great for toddlers, unlike many parks that cater mostly to the older school age crowd. ¬†In the summer there are water jets, which while not as exciting as some of the newer installations around town, do the job of keeping everyone cool and refreshed on hot summer days. ¬†With many picnic tables scattered throughout the park, it's a perfect picnic destination. ¬†My picks? ¬†Either Vieux Pool Room down on Rachel for steamies and fries or the Metro grocery store up on Mont-Royal for supplies if the urge to picnic hits you after you've already left home. ¬†Something to keep in mind is that Baldwin Park is actually two different areas: one stretches from Sherbrooke to Rachel, and includes what is often known as the Fullum Pool and the community garden; the other is hidden between Mont-Royal and Rachel, and has the soccer fields, playground, bathrooms and fountain."
Beautiful park! very picturesque and a good long walk... Great adventure park for the kids too!!
"Very unique park, you can rent paddle boats and enjoy long walks. It's close to the Trans Canada Trail so you can get there using your bike from Longueuil or Brossard."

"This is a fun little park in Verdun, another one of it's riverside parks.What makes this one different is the inclusion of several things like the Verdun Auditorium, a public outdoor pool, a softball/baseball pitch, a kid's playground, an open field where people are usually either playing ultimate Frisbee or soccer, a skateboard park and a great hill which in the wintertime is transformed into an epic sledding hill. ¬†In the summertime is covered in green and trees and you'll usually find people picnicking, meditating, doing yoga, little kids trying to catch butterflies or just hanging out or come Saturday and Wednesday nights during the balmy nights of July, watching the La Ronde fireworks ¬†from a distance. You can get a pretty good view from here.Also, it's a bit of a mini-Mont Royal in that, there are great views at the top of the hill of the Montreal skyline which looks great particularly in the evening.The skateboard park is constantly full of skaters practicing and doing crazy things, the pool is always full and with the new Verdun municipal beach which is located behind the Verdun Auditorium, I have a feeling this little park's popularity will skyrocket in the next few years."
"Verdun beach isn't quite ready yet but from what I see potential is there! They have sand, a lifeguard, clean water to swim, drinking fountains, showers!! slides for kids and a fun climbing wall. It's still under construction but open for business! I'm so excited for this addition to Verdun. The park nearby is gorgeous and really clean. It has lots of land, tennis courts, outdoor pool, baseball diamond, skate park, splash pads, public washrooms, trees for shade, bike paths. It's almost a secret because it's not crowded. It even has views of Montreal skyline! Great place to enjoy the outdoors in the city."
"Quite honestly one of the coolest hidden spots in Montreal. If you want to impress a date, have a romantic picnic, hang out with a friend, drive around aimlessly contemplating life itself, this is your spot. There is a park spot with some bleachers and a parking lot, both are great for plane watching. You will need a car to get here and if it's cold I don't recommend watching from outside. But in the summer, bring some picnic chairs and watch away!"
"Great for plane-spotters! There's benches, bleachers, lost of open space, and cool information boards with info on the planes and the airport. This woukd make a great place for a picnic. If you are an avid plane-watcher, you can't miss this!"
"I loved this part of our trip. We came here right around sunset, the park was quiet but alive with couples and people just enjoying the outdoors and the beautiful park. There were also bugs. Lots and lots of bugs! The playground was cute and looked like it could entertain a kid for a few hours! There was some water toys that would have been a ton of fun on hot summer days. The view of the water was beautiful and made me feel at peace. I am surprised there are no yelp reviews of this place yet! I am very happy to have noticed this place on google maps as we tried to find our way around town."
Lovely park with pond surrounding it. It becomes a skating rink in the winter. There's a grocery store nearby so it's great for picnics and diners outside. Very nice for lounging around and reading. There's a kids park near as well.
"I went there for a photoshoot. The place itself looks nice. It has a bridge, a big pavilion, bathrooms, benches, a tennis court and a little ""river"".The place is really clean and well maintained. Also, it's really quiet and there's not a lot of people However, the paint on the pavilion and the bridge is chipped in a lot of places. Overall, nice park!"
"Upon a dock, out in the nightWhile fishes sleep beneath the tideStanding still out in the light Beneath the birds of graceful flightIn the quiet calm of waves in turnOr in the day when sunlight burnsAs the breeze catches the grass and fernsLies a place to heal infirmed Fishing pole in hand and beach blanket in tote We come to sit and peacefully soak In the rays of sun and watch ducks floatAnd forget about the daily woes -------- Installment 45 poetry reviews Another oddity being fixed right here, this review was a long time comin. And I felt it needed a poem.We really like this park to fish and relax at and it has several ""spots"" we like to try and ""get"". It's a fairly busy/popular park, but usually we still manage to get 1 of our 3 fave spots. Unfortunately there are some socially inept morons who frequent this park as well, so despite getting a good ""spot"", some a$$hole may still decide it's ok to come fish 5 feet next to you thereby cutting you off on your spot... Unfortunately the only way to deal with these people is to flat out tell them they are being stupid and to please go away because otherwise they will snag your line and make things worst. Please don't be like these nitwits: if you see someone in a spot: give them a good fishing zone and find somewhere else, it's only polite and neighborly. Bonus points: they added outhouse bathrooms, which means I can stay fishing longer and don't hafta leave to go home to the bathroom. Also every Tuesday and Thursday they do actvitities in this park. Thursdays consist of setting up a whole stage with live performances by the water: last Thursday's Creole music was absolutely perfect while we fished to our heart's delight!"
Great location to have a picnic or to catch someFish.I First discovered this location after a picnic with family and I have been coming by ever since.Located right off the bike path you'll find a million geese (depending time of year) and many people relaxing on the long wooden benches.The water is strong here so you'll always see people fishing and paddle boarders as well as jet skiers.Great place to relax
"This is a strange little park along Verdun's riverside. I'm more inclined to call it a green space than an actual park because it's so small. Sitting in front of the Verdun Circus school, it's basically a pretty bare field on one side, an outdoor gym/ workout centre on the other with a few park benches and lounges and some trees and that's about it. I never really see anyone here except maybe some seniors playing petoncle during the day and sketchy looking people who remind me of the dealers I'd see hanging out in the back of the high school I'd gone to."
NOW DOG FRIENDLY! Just noticed they added a fairly big dog park! There were plenty of dogs there even today! When the weather gets nicer we're guna take Irie there for sure! Now all they need to do is clean up that pool and fix the sprinklers in the kid's area and this park will be worth 5 stars for sure!
"Parc Mont Royal is a great place in every season. The tobogganing slope at the corner of Cote-Ste-Catherine and Parc might look tame from afar, but the ride is certainly speedy and bumpy enough to get the adrenalin flowing - a little bit. No wonder it is teaming with youngsters as well as young-at-hearts during the winter weekends. Grab your magic carpet and give it a go! Btw, it is free, but you have to bring your own toboggan. If you don't own one, the tubing slopes close to Lac Castor provide a nice alternative. For a few dollars you get access to an inner tube and lanes to slide down - all day long. Friendly helpers at the top of the slope will give you a push and a spin, and off you go! Minimum age is 4 years. A nice mug of hot chocolate to warm those frozen fingers is available at the Lac Castor cafeteria and gear rental. Outdoor enthusiasts can rent snowshoes, skis and skates here at reasonable prices, too.When fun in the snow is so easily accessible, there is no excuse to spend winter indoors!"
"What a nice discovery driving along the quiet area nearby. Was looking for a small park to play soccer with the kiddo and I stumbled upon this gorgeous super park that has recently been renovated with a beautiful new play ground and splash pad. The kid loved it. The whole play area is so great and innovating!There is free and very accessible parking.Park Charbonneau is going to be a family favorite. Lots of place to play games, soccer and volleyball areas. Even a small mountain during winter! There's the option to have a picnic too! You can also go near the water and feed the ducks!"
"WOW this beats any park I've seen in Montreal! It's only a 20 min drive from downtown and there's lots of free parking! I didn't get to see any deer as I've heard are prevalent but it was full of joggers, respectful families, and lots of seniors calmly enjoying the scenery. No wild kids running around and no large families lounging around having a public BBQ left and right (my pet peeve and I see this in many parks). This is a perfect place to go for a leisurely walk and enjoy nature, bike riding, exercising, and the jungle gym is well maintained with swings and fun slides. The park was so huge I didn't get to see much of it but I hope to go back soon and take lots of pics!"
"Wonderful park for walking, jogging or to sit and read a book! This park doesn't consist of grass and flowers, instead its a forest with many trails of different distances to choose from. You can do a 2km, 3 km, 5 km or 10km and there are lots of signs to keep you on your chosen path. You will find a lot of birds and deer that are residents of the park. There is also a small lake area with a fountain where you can sit and read or have a picnic. There is a parking lot with free parking, a couple of food trucks, bathrooms and a playground for kids."
This parc miss some trees and some bench ! It is more a square of grass with a garden for kids (even water fountains) and a small exercise area. Not the kind of place you want to chill in all the afternoon.
Great little park to wind down a little from all the shopping. With a great little fountain and plenty of seating.They even have a big gazebo.
"Just a little park across from Leonard Cohen's house, just a sweet little place where we go to drink a coffee, listen to the old people, feed the pigeons, and a place where we came together when we lost a friend to sing the old songs of peace and revolution. Just a tiny square with a beautiful old gazebo and small tiles lining the tiny walkways. A piece of the old Main, sitting across from new wave caf√© bar Darling, remembering. Sometimes there is also live band karakoe here, sometimes there are dance classes. The apartments around it are in varying degrees of decay and heritage. It's just one block, a couple trees, a place to meet."
"Nice small little park, right beside some great restaurants. Grab some food to go and sit in the park, and enjoy your surrounds!Go Portugal!"
"The 7-day Tour East Bus trip that I'm traveling on stopped here; we have 50 tourists in our group.The $222.50 attractions package includes access to the Whale Watching Boat Tour, Thousand Island Boat Tour, Hopewell Rocks, Maritime Museum, etc., of which this attraction is one of the experiences.Known by many names such as the Olympic Tower or the Montreal Tower, this inclined tower structure features an observatory at a height of over 170 meters or 558 feet. The stadium was built for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games.A quick trip up the tower and then back down again can be accurately summed up by the pun word (or nationality) Russ...ian!In its time, the tower was an engineering marvel. ¬†It's still a must see monument if you're visiting."
"From the outside, I think most people will find that this tower looks incomplete and quite ugly. ¬†However, Star Trek fans might imagine this as the USS Enterprise NC-1701 being under construction, with the tower being the neck, and the stadium being the saucer portion. ¬†Maybe I'm a just a crazy nerd...indeed...$23 gets you a ride up the glass slanted elevator. The observation deck provides some nice sweeping views of Montreal, obviously. ¬†There's also some exhibits about the history of the 1976 Olympic games, which this city seems to be overly obsessed about. Not sure if this is worth $23 alone, but entry is covered by the Montreal Passeport($99 for 72hrs), so it was worth it for me."
"While I'm not a fan of heights, the Olympic tower was anticipated by me mainly because of the fact it's the largest incline tower in the world and apart of your Olympic history experience in Montreal. Once again I had the Montreal passport card and was able to just get into the tower with this card (the card also got me access to the subway, for which the station is right in the stadium). First you that a like incline railway up to the tower (very beautiful and scenic, not really scary because the railway amazingly stays horizontal while riding up the tower. Once you get to the top, it's nothing but high views of Montreal and beyond. The reason why this tower is a little underwhelming is because I have done quite a few other towers in other cities, and they would include exhibits on the city and whatever else and this tower has nothing. Not long to do at all and will not take up your day in the least. Nice place for beautiful views but theirs a lot of places for that in Montreal and this place is more a few miles out of downtown."
The Montreal Tower is the highest inclined tower in the world and has some incredible views of Montreal. The ride up is pretty cool and way faster than I expected. When you get to the top you can hang out and check out the views for as long as you like. There is also a small gift shop at the top. In the bottom part of the building there is an interesting exhibit about the Montreal Olympics and the use of the stadium in the years since. There are other activities nearby and between all of them you could easily spend most of a day in this area.
"Definitely a must-visit if it's your first time in Montreal. ¬†This was built for the '72 Olympics and is attached to the Stade de Montreal next door. ¬†The admission for the funicular/tower is separate but you can buy a combo ticket if you go into the Stade first.This tower offers a 360 view of the city of Montreal. ¬†I appreciated the information available under the windows to let you know what you're looking at. ¬†We went on a kind of cloudy day so it was a bit hard to see everything, especially Mont Royal (which is probably the best thing to look at). ¬†It takes a bit of time to get up here and get back down if there's a lot of people so prepare to wait a bit. ¬†There's also not really good air conditioning in the waiting areas so it's a bit hot in the summer months. ¬†There's a public bike station on the property so it's a great spot to bike to/from if you're on a tour of the city."
Very cool architecture. Good views. It's cool to imagine what it would have been like here during the 1976 Olympics. The entrance fee is reasonable.
"Interesting perspective of the stadium and surrounding grounds but is it worth it?On our recent visit to Montreal, we bought tickets and rode the funicular. ¬†It is easily found from the subway. ¬†It is a unique experience, but, upon further reflection, I'm not convinced it was worth it. ¬†We did have great views and could spend as much time as we wanted at the top. ¬†I feel like we got a better feel for the area by walking around. ¬†If you are an avid Olympic fan, you'll be sure to enjoy. Otherwise... I'm not as sure. ¬†I would budget, from standing in line for the tickets to getting off the funicular and exiting the building, about an hour. ¬†Also the area doesn't have many restaurants. ¬†If you are planning on lunch, be prepared to walk a few blocks. ¬†We did and were delighted. ¬†If you are planning a visit to or from the insectarium or botanical garden, it is an easy walk with good signage."
"If you're a non-resident and you are paying admission and parking, this is not worth your money unless you have a thing for going up in towers....which apparently we do. It was relatively cool to look at and neat to be at the top but you can tell the 1980s decor is old and tacky. The elevator ride is cool both up and down but if you have seen one view from a tower, you have seen them all. The gift shops both at the top and bottom are pretty weak and the place seems sad and abandoned. I have been to a few old Olympic parks and they all seem like a huge waste of money as they are super expensive and dead when the games are over. Drive by to take photos but not worth going to the top unless you just want to say you did it....which apparently, we did."
"The Montreal Tower Observatory is attached to the Olympic Stadium, a place where they hold sports events, salons, fairs, shows, exhibitions, film shoots, social events, and many more. ¬†There are 56,000 seats in the stand and the whole amphitheater is covered. ¬†I was able to check this place out while the Boston Red Sox was in town, playing against the Toronto Blue Jays. ¬†It was unbelievable in terms of the turn-out, as there were true-blue Sox fans and true-blue Jays fans. ¬†Accessing the stadium is easy, as it's right off the Pie-IX stop off the Metro. ¬†Don't forget to check out the Montreal Tower as well while you're there, as it's considered the tallest inclined tower in the world; it takes about 2 minutes to get to the top, and you're able to see the city of Montreal up there. ¬†Highly recommend in getting here via the public transportation.+right off the Pie-IX Metro stop+attached to the Olympic Stadium+tallest inclined tower in the world"
Well worth the metro ride to check out the great view of Montreal with the nice glass-encased funicular ride up.
Definitely a great visit if you have time to head out to the Olympic Park (you can take a super easy metro ride there). The view is incredible (even on a cloudy day) and you can spend as much time as you want at the top of the tower! I'm usually scared of heights and did just fine at the top. Touring he stadium was awesome as well. Our tour guide was super knowledgeable and I totally geeked out seeing the Olympic pool.
"Want an incline and a view without shelling out nearly $25 for 10 minutes?Go skiing instead.They have package deals where you can go to the observatory and the planetarium thing, but it'll cost you like $70 per person.Total waste of money since the Olympic park is boring.Having been to the Beijing Olympic Stadium I can say that this one is boring and outdated.But, it's a piece of history, hence the 3 stars."
"Incredible! It was over $25 but it was well worth it for the views, including of the botanical gardens I had just visited and Old Montreal, where I had stayed. So beautiful! It was a bit difficult to find the entrance, though."
"Went on the guided tour of the Olympic Park of Montreal led by Jeff. He was a great tour guide who clearly knew his history. He was able to answer every question asked by people on the tour. You get to see the Olympic pools, workout facilities, and stadium. Jeff knew how many gold medals each tourist's home country had won in 1976."
"It was a bright sunny day yesterday and Gord and I took the metro (subway) to the Montr√©al Tower.At 165 metres, the Montr√©al Tower is the tallest inclined tower in the world! Its 45-degree angle is awe-inspiring, especially when you consider that the Leaning Tower of Pisa's tilt is only 5 degrees!From its summit, visitors can admire the entire Greater Montreal region and up to 80 kilometres of the St. Lawrence River valley. A breathtaking panorama, it has been awarded a three-star rating - the highest available - by the renowned Michelin Guide!Visitors can reach the top of the Montr√©al Tower on a mesmerizing climb in a glass-encased funicular that holds up to 76 passengers.The funicular is the only one in the world that operates on a curved structure. It has a hydraulic system that allows the cabin to remain horizontal during the two-minute ride to the top.The views were great!There was a booth where you could have your picture taken and then email it to yourself. Of course, Gord and I did . ¬†There were models of the tower and Olympic Stadium.It was definitely worth the trip as the views were spectacular!"
"We took the tram up for the 360 degree view of Montreal. I usually forego these attractions because I think they are a rip off. However, since this was included in our Montreal Passport, why not? ¬†Ride up was smooth and you get to see the city on your way up. Afterwards, you can spend as long as you like at the observatory. This reminds me of the Peak in Hong Kong and the Empire State Building. It was a clear day so you can see everything!"
"For $18 a ticket, I think it's pretty steep to go up that incline (no pun intended). ¬†And the day we went it was overcast so the lady said the view is reduced. ¬†Asked if she could reduce the price and she didn't even entertain the idea."
"To get to the top you take a cable-car type elevator which gives you a great view and is kind of fun. There's really not much to say about the tower except that it gives you excellent views of the Olympic Park and all of Montreal, as well as the St. Lawrence River. If you're looking for scenic pictures, this is your place. Also there's the bragging rights of saying you've been in the world's tallest leaning tower.It has a gift shop at the top as well, and interactive monitors that tell about some of the things you can see in and around Montreal."
"The Observatory Tower is really a cool place to go! From above you can see the entire city (or big part of it). The good points are that it is cheap compared to other ticket prices, the staff is friendly, there is a digital map, pictures etc.They have a photo boot where you can take a picture with your friends and email it straight away and for free! I liked the souvenir boutique as well.The things I didn't like were the fact that the binoculars work only with a 1$ coin and the timing is about a minute. The glass of the elevator was not very clean. It was very cold, so take a jacket with you :)"
"Amazing building, the Olympic Tower in Montreal is the tallest inclined tower in the world, at 175 metres. It was built as part of the 1976 Olympic Village, and you can visit it by taking a funicular to the viewing platform at the top. This has one of the best views in Montreal, though a little pricey for what is essentially a trip to the top of a building and back ($15.95 for adults, half that for children). I think most people combine it with a trip to the neighbouring Biod√¥me or other parts of the Olympic Park but I just wanted to see the strange architecture of the tower."
"I was at the tower for a wedding reception in October. ¬†The facility was wonderful and the views were spectacular. ¬† The location and parking was very easy to get to if you drove in on your own, as for ubers or taxis couldn't pull into drop guests off so they had to walk down the long tunnel area to get to the entrance. ¬†The gondola experience heading to the top of the tower was a wonderful way to appreciate the views of Montreal. ¬†Overall the experience was one of a kind for a wedding reception - but I am not 100% sold on visiting if I didn't have a true purpose."
"While visiting the Olympic Park in Montreal, my daughter and I also paid to go up the Tower on the Funiculaire. ¬†The tower is the tallest inclined tower and it supports the roof on the Olympic Stadium. ¬†It was not there for the 1976 games, but was build 10 or 11 years later (during the Olympic games there was no roof on the stadium). ¬†The ride up the tower is in a double decker, glass elevator. ¬†It goes up the outside of the tower giving an interesting view of the city. ¬†Once at the top you have a 360 degree view which is quite good especially on a clear day. ¬†There is also a gift shop on top.We enjoyed it and found it worthwhile, but the tickets are a little on the expensive side even with the favorable exchange rate at the time."
"Simple design but you can't beat the views. You really get a nice panoramic layout of the city with Mount Royal in the back, downtown, and the river and islands. Make sure to come on a sunny day. Montreal can look quite dreary when it's cloudy. Plan to spend about 20 minutes up here. The elevator has views of the areas east of the city, which doesn't have much. It's about $20 to go up."
"Oo la la! ¬†A vital part of the Olympic Stadium. ¬†Montr√©al Tower is noted as the highest incline tower in the world of a 175 metre elevation at a 45 degree angle, built by Marine Industries of Rimouski (Qu√©bec). ¬†The incline takes less than two minutes. ¬†Montr√©al Tower was first open to the public in November 1987. ¬†Visitors obtain breathtaking panorama views up to 80 kilometres in clear weather where photos are a must! ¬†I highly recommend a visit to feel the 1976 Olympic spirit and beyond."
"This is the landmark that is an incline building. ¬†It's a marvel to look at but beyond that, don't pay the money to go to the top."
"Great place to spend the day with family or a group. A lot of history in this place. The tower is a unique structure, however I rather go to Mount Royal park area for a free view of the city instead of paying close to $25 for a 10 minute ride up and down."
"Let's state the obvious: $18 a ticket for a (maybe) 3 minute ride that is definitely showing signs of wear is a bit of a rip-off. But I was a tourist coming to Montreal and I was damned if I wasn't going to see this. If you're even mildly afraid of heights, you will probably want to skip the elevator ride on the incline.If you aren't afraid of heights, you will enjoy the brief 270 degree view of the city. You will see buildings, water, and Mount Royale, if you're lucky. If you're here on a foggy day, you won't be seeing much -just like me. Don't expect to be overwhelmed with excitement, either way."
"If you are like me and enjoy experiencing picturesque views of a city's skyline, you would be hard-pressed to find a better place than the Observatory. The funicular that takes you to the top of the tower is cool in and of itself, but come here for the spectacular views of Montreal."
Big funicular ride up the Olympic stadium with a cool observatory. There's not much to say. The view of Montreal is awesome and the ride is smooth and impressive. Not much to do but look out the window.
"I'm going to go with 4 stars. ¬†It's great, but it can't compete one on one with the grandeur of Toronto's CN Tower. ¬†The unique feature about the Inclined Tower at the Olympic Stadium of '76 is that it is the tallest free standing and most inclined concrete structure in the world. ¬†And that sort of feat, in the 70s, was most likely to make for some severe budget overruns ... and it reportedly did.Set on the grounds of the Olympic Stadium and adjacent structures such as the aquatic center and an exhibit of different bio-systems with representative animal life, the site is captivating for the extensive sculpting of these buildings and for the stark eery feeling of these shapes set against these vast open concrete plazas around the Olympic complex. ¬†They are impressive, though they are starting to look dated and there is epoxy that should be applied here and there. ¬†I'm sure the facility management team has their hands full. ¬†The Expos used to play in the stadium below the Inclined Tower and cables from the tower hold up the stadium's roof cover.I really recommend going up on the Inclined Tower to its observatory if you haven't been. ¬†The Metro exits are Viau or Pie IX. ¬†One goes to the rear of the incline and will see a 2-story elevator that makes the sloped ascent. ¬†The height is about 60 stories. ¬†The price is ok and AAA/CAA helps a little. ¬†Now, compared to the CN Tower, the perimeter up top for viewing the city is slightly constrained, though it has a good angle and a good view. ¬†From the tower, you can see Centre-Ville, Sherbrooke St. connecting the center to the Olympic complex, the South Shore, Ile Ste-Helene in the middle of the river, all the major bridges including the Jacques Cartier, the hill of Parc Mont-Royal, and more. ¬†It really gives one an appreciation for Montreal's spectacular island setting."
Riding up this tower is fun and the view is spectacular Make sure you go on a clear day so you can see everything and club it with another attraction to save $$
"Every major city has a place that offers a great vantage point to overlook as far as the eye can see. ¬†This is Montreal's. ¬†Located in Olympic Stadium, circa 1976, it is nested next to a planetarium and the famous Biodome. ¬†While the ride isn't cheap, for first time goers it is worth the money. ¬†You take a bi-level gondola up the sloped side of the building, enjoying the views at you ascend. ¬†At the top, there are panoramic views with large windows to better viewing and at it's center, a gift shop. ¬†There are no food vendors but if you head down one level, there are seats and tables where you can bring your own snacks and drinks to enjoy. ¬†Definitely something not to miss if you're visiting Montreal."
"At something like $18 per person when bundled with a Biodome ticket as of last week, I think they've reached a point where maybe the price has overstepped the value of the experience.The elevator ride up is pretty cool, and the 270-degree view of Montreal once you get to the top is nice. ¬†Off in the distance, you can see the cluster of skyscrapers of the core downtown area alongside Mont Royal. ¬†That might be the best part of the view, although it's far enough away to be a bit underwhelming. ¬†A much better view of downtown is available by walking up to the chalet at Mont Royal.Of course, that's not the fault of the observatory. The cityscape is what it is, and it's worth something to be able to see it from this vantage point. ¬†It's just not worth $18 per person, in my opinion. Still, if you're a visitor to the area you should do it just to have the experience.Side note, it's evident especially on the elevator ride up and back, that this landmark has been falling into some state of disrepair (not in a dangerous way, but lots of old, peeling paint, etc). ¬†It's sad to see, because it's a beautiful piece of work."
"For photographers as first timers, you get a good vantage point of the city with a good picturesque view as far as the eye can see, provided it's a beautiful day weather wise. It's not cheap to take the tour but you can get a bundle package that gets you into the Biodome as well. Definitely, a major tourist hot spot given what the area offers such as the Botanical Gardens, Biodome, and Insectarium, plus the label as the venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics."
Not worth the money for parking and the tower. Complete rip off. Stay away. There is much more in Montreal to see that is much much better. The whole Olympic park may seem cool in theory but in reality it is a giant giant tourist trap.
Although a bit pricey I think it is definitely worth visiting. The views of the Olympic Park are quite impressive and while the infrastructure is a bit old (read: not being cared for) it was still a treat
Quick ride up the top of the tower offers great views of Montreal. ¬†It is worth the money to buy the combo ticket with the Bio-dome
"The Olympic Tower in Montreal is the tallest inclined tower in the world, at 175 metres. It was built as part of the 1976 Olympic Village, and you can visit it by taking a funicular to the viewing platform at the top. This has one of the best views in Montreal, though a little pricey for what is essentially a trip to the top of a building and back ($15.95 for adults, half that for children). I think most people combine it with a trip to the neighbouring Biod√¥me or other parts of the Olympic Park but I just wanted to see the strange architecture of the tower."
"Five stars for our neighbors to the North and this most impressive piece of architecture. I will agree with other people that it is showing age but the view is worth the ( bloated ) price as you'll never probably get to do it again. The stadium itself has not seen baseball in many years and one worker was proud to tell me that the stadium recently hosted an AC/DC concert ( which my wife and I chuckled at since they are yesterdays news ) but for the once in a lifetime chance to see Montreal from many angles, it was worth the experience."
"Look, I love Montreal, but the view is probably better of the tower from the ground than the ground from the tower. Montreal just isn't the greatest skyline, and is the bank of Montreal really that much of a landmark? ¬†Maybe I don't understand the city, but most of the landmarks they note are totally not noteworthy to me. It's 10 dollars extra with your biodome ticket, and while I couldn't say it's actually worth it to go, it's probably worth it just to say you did."
"riding up the tower in the funiculaire was quick but fun, and the view from above is better than you can imagine. looking down from the top, you can still see the wonderful architecture and beauty of the city, altogether. it's absolutely fantastic. it should definitely be a must-see for anyone visiting montreal."
"Jean-Paul Riopelle square is one of my favourite places in Montreal. It is in fact little park with numerous benches surrounded by new buildings and brightened by the colourful windows of Palais des Congres. Whether you come from Old Montreal or China Town you would be surprised by the feeling of freshness and contrasting modernity. What is really outstanding about this square is the fountain of the famous Montreal born artist Jean-Paul Riopelle: La Joute. You can read about its history yourself in Wikipedia: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/‚Ä¶, just don't forget to see it with your own eyes. It is beautiful!"
"Place Jean-Paul Riopelle is a public space that is built on a former parking lot. ¬†It's located between the new entrance to the Palais des congres and of the CDP Capital Centre. ¬†This little gem of a park is found in DT Montreal at crossroads of busy intersections; however, a great little spot to sit and read a book, relax your feet for a while, or to just people-watch, as there are plenty of benches and trees for shade. ¬†During the evenings, there are lights that light up the park. ¬†Don't forget to check out the sculpture-fountain by Riopelle called 'La Joute,' which is part of a fountain that runs a 30-minute spectacle between mid-May through mid-October.+plenty of benches and trees+ 'La Joute' fountain - 30-minute 'performance' offered from mid-May-mid-October"
"Another beautiful park if you are in the area. No kid playground that I could see but a lovely space to sit and relax or stroll through. ¬†There is a memorial in the middle of the park with a small fountain. ¬†What caught my eye was the upright piano right at the corner of the park as you exit the subway. I think I read somewhere that its public piano season? ¬†WTH, Montreal? ¬†Have I told you I loved you yet today? ¬†If that piano was in LA, it would be in someone's house by that same afternoon. ¬†Side note about Metro station at Du College...it's so pretty with the stained glass art! ¬†It's not as detailed as a cathedral's would be but it's simplicity was still a pleasant surprise. As I exited, I was just staring and taking my own sweet time admiring the sunlight shining through the glass and turning corners and crevices of what would normally be a dreary subway station into a living piece of art relying on the sun to bring it to full glory."
"Terrific park on the eastern side of Nun's Island, with an undeveloped waterfront with wide open views of the South Shore and Champlain Bridge. Not a lot of picnic tables or park benches but everyone who shows up here seems to be well stacked with their own stuff, inflatable kayaks, stand-up paddles, outdoor bbq, volleyball nets, etc. Nun's Island has an extensive network of bike paths but there's also a great hiking trail along the waters edge, in the back yards of the exclusive residences of this wealthy bedroom community, which also intersect at this park. Given how crazy ""mainland"" Verdun has become in the past 3 years especially that dank beach, I'm happy ¬†to find a much quieter, cleaner and natural place where I can watch the birds, read books underneath ¬†the cool shade of willow trees and possibly venture and wade in the water and not have to see a single obnoxious hipster or man-bun in sight."
"I feel compelled to write a review about this little park immediately. Why would somebody wonder? Because I just listened to Orchestre M√©tropolitain performing in West Vancouver Park and attempted to check in during a pause between the musical peices. Well, the park didn't even exist in Yelp. Of corse this is no longer the case as I just created it. So one may ask why at √éle des S≈ìurs exists a park with such an unusual name. It appears the city of Verdun is a twin municipality with West Vancouver, therefore the name. I truly hope the municipality of West Vancouver has a park named Verdun. Now about the park. It is accessible via bike path and has a little playground. The best part is the park is at Saint Laurence and you can go to the river through few access points through the threes. There are also few picnic tables near the water. During cold seasons the park offers some breathtaking views of the river, but the local residents really crowd around during the summer and in big numbers. Orchestre M√©tropolitain performs at West Vancouver park every year during the first weekend of August. Whoever came with the idea to create this amazing event in beautiful surroundings is a genious. The orchestra is outstanding, the concert programme is always oriented towards more popular and easy to listen classical works, the best approach for a diverse public. Considering the fact the talented conductor Yannick Nezet-S√©guin is the new musical director of the Met, tonight Ile des S≈ìur felt like Manhattan of Montreal. Thus the five stars!"
"During the summer the park gets packed and despite that it's always clean. The pool opens too and there are 3 baseball and soccer fields. There is a park for children and space for people who like to work out or play other games.I come through the park pretty late at all times of the year and I often feel pretty safe! They could really use some night lights though, wouldn't recommend it during the winter."
"I love this parc. It has a great swimming pool, picnic tables, kids playgrounds and summer screenings, and tango nights. It can get a bit too packed during summer, never the less it is a neighborhood jem. Tip for groups: buy some beers and fruits at the Metro store nearby and make an impromptu picnic. Tip for loners: at the heart there is a garden with wooden beds- perfect for reading a book in the sun."
"I love this cool park, during the summer it is so green filed with people having fun in picnic's, playing different social games, ping-pong, P√©tanque or just running around the park. It also has some soccer and baseball fields a wonderful kids area and even a dog park. During the winter this park becomes more mysterious once the green goes away but the people are still here, less picnic but still jogging and having fun. It has a few Hockey arena's and the paths become an outside ice skating trails. Cool green patch in the middle of the city"
"An excellent dog park! I am absolutely distraught that there isn't one closer to my house, but this is only a half hour walk from me, and it's totally worth it! The people there all know each other well, and the dogs are super friendly! There's occasionally a bark or two, but what else could you expect from a dog park? When I went, there was a fight, but it was immediately resolved very nicely and the people involved were all very calm and well-mannered. I would definitely recommend you going. Note; there are a lot of other attractions at the park (ex; hammocks, playgrounds, soccer fields, etc) but I only visited the dog park aspect."
"Got to Laurier pool at 6:30pm and they closed the pool for water quality reasons at 6:45pm and they didn't want to give anyone a refund. They said to go to Baldwin pool instead, but by the time I would have gotten there, it would have been 30min to closing at best. Never coming back."
"Such a great park!! So many locals hang out in this park everyday and it is really beautiful to see how social everyone is. There is also a pool that is free during the week and 5.00 on the weekends. We wanted to go to the pool, but it was very crowded with a long line on Sunday afternoon. Tip-you can drink in the park as long as you have food."
"Parc Laurier is a 5 star park for sure, what with the newly shady and sizeable pool, the ping pong tables, the great leafy expanses of gently rolling grass dappled with adorable picnic'ers, the tidy old timey public bathrooms and overall sense of laid back community."
"Parc Laurier is either my favourite or second favourite park in the city. Big leafy, shady trees in the summer keep this ginger from burning to a crisp, but also a tiny skating area in the Winter to keep me entertained...this park truly has a bit of everything. The swimming pool is lovely (and freaking cold!), the grass areas are plentiful, the public washrooms are decent and close and helloooo, there are ping pong tables, niiiiice. People BBQ, drink wine and act their age here; now that's a great Montreal park!"
Be extremely careful of the dog park. I have found that in Montreal people do not train there dogs properly and was almost attached. It's dangerous. I feel so bad for the dogs. Neglectful redneck owners.
"We've been playing anarchist soccer in Parc Laurier every sunday in the summer for what, like, six years now? ¬†And it's just an awesome parc. We play next to the dog park and man, those dogs go nutso in there. It'd be awesome to do a giant soccer game - dogs vs people except they'd totally win.But yeah, aside from soccer, there's a sweet pool, a massive kiddy park, 2 (count'em, 2) baseball diamond, a huge massive soccer field (which we don't play on, it's so intimidating), and now ping-pong tables and more nook and crannies for you to have a picnic than is even mathematically possible. It's the kind of parc where you go and you're bound to run into one of your buds.So yeah, get your summer on at parc Laurier!"
"My favorite park in a city full of them. I love also the surroundings. For me, that's the best area in the popular Plateau."
"This one sure gets my vote, nicest pool in mtl, and the wading pool is pretty cool as well (if you happen to be 3 ft tall or still have one of those 2-3 yrs old bambino). Thumbs up to the administration for not having those annoying rules and regulations seen in other public pools in mtl (dark wink for the Park Decelles pool in Ville St-Laurent). Actually, can someone explain why in the Park Decelles pool a 7 yrs old kid can't use the pool springboard while there is no age regulation in other Montreal public pools? Are there sharks in the Decelles pool and we don't know about it? Anyway, back to the Laurier pool, pretty nice, has this wooden beach, there are places with shadow from trees so even though you like Red Lobster, you don't need to look like one at the end of the day, lots of showers, and a nicely confusing changing room - this shouldn't be the first time when I unwillingly get into the ladies changing room, sometimes I wonder if it's made so confusing on a purpose. Actually, one weird ( and even up to creepy) thing is that there are toilets in the family changing room, so your kids can freely enjoy and pull one of those hard to find the proper answer observations, about this guy taking a - put he's choice here - in the short height door toilet, such as dad, I just saw his underwear on the floor between his legs, yuk. ¬†(Mooment of silence). Anyway, besides the confusion with the changing rooms, and the absence of a dining tables area inside the pool, this is a very nice place to go. The pool itself it's not too crowded, staff it's polite and cool, cheap entrance fees (can someone hire the managers of the pool for the Montreal's parking fees and tickets please? For once those guys know how to find a reasonable fee without making us feel some sort of a financial molesting like when parking a car in the Sainte-H√©l√®ne so called 'public' park area at 16$ for the day. ¬†Oh, and on a nicer ending note, whats up with the young and restless watchers PACKED close to the springboard jumping area? I so need discretion when messing a jump into the pool or worst when loosing my swimwear under the water. Those critical moments are better kept private, instead one feels like being on the stage at the Carnegie Hall."
"Beautiful hidden park, small but many trees some benches and amazing view to jacques cartier bridge. Bike path inside the park and washrooms available."
"This spot probably doesn't have any reviews yet, because it's not the easiest to find!I'd recommend picking up a Bixi bike and riding the paths up here to see the sunset. Be careful, as many of the paths are near the highway, or run by some areas where you need to be diligent.There is a large overhang/gazebo at the peak of the park that a family will inevitable claim early in the morning fora a BBQ. There's some benches with a nice view of the amusement park, the river, and the city skyline.Not much else to do up here except hang out."
"Very lovely park to escape too when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, without having to go to far. There's a lovely pond you could sit by and have a picnic or just to hang out and have a chat with some friends. There's different paths you could walk on within the park. At night it gets lite up with beautiful English style lamps; it gives you the feels like you're in England or something. I find it very ""bougie"" looking park, you could definitely tell your in westmount. Pets are welcome, just make sure you clean up after them or else you could get hit with a $300 fine. I enjoy spending time here."
"I can't believe I've never been here before! Beatiful park centrally locates in the city. Lots of green spaces, bike paths, benches and ponds with the cutest resident ducks. It was busy when I was there on a Saturday but possible to keep your distance with others. They have public bathrooms on locations. Unfortunately, they were pretty messy. The park is well-maintained and is perfect for relaxing afternoon. I will definitely be visiting here again"
"I've been going for about 30 years.It's absolutely beautiful. ¬† Feed the ducks, bring a picnic lunch and relax for the day.The neighbourhood is absolutely wonderful - peaceful, perfect for taking pictures and quiet.Bring the kids, bring the dogs, bring your friends, bring a book....just go ¬†:-)"
"This is one of the most serene and beautiful parks in the city which is close to the city center but not quite. The pond, the small waterfall, the cobble-stone paths, the library (now over 100 years old), the green spaces, the variety of huge, mature trees which give plenty of shade, you can easily pick up lunch on the go on Sherbrooke street and come over and spend an afternoon here spread out on a blanket, either chilling out with a great friend or a great book.There's also a great dog part which will allow you to see some very interesting breeds since this is Westmount after all."
"Nice little park , litlle lake , beaucoup d'ombre des arbres, some free shows in the summer and coffee place at southside of the park. Also the public library is on the westside of park."
"A great park to hang out, it has something for everyone. There are plenty of winding walking trails, a pond, water fountain small children can play in, some soccer fields, a swing set area, a library and a community centre. In the summer this is a great place to see Shakespeare in the park. There are also family community events during the year held here"
"This much-loved and used park has been around since my grandparents' day - and I suspect even longer, actually. Bordered by Sherbrooke and St. Catherine on its north and south, it's in walking distance of the Westmount shops on these streets, and even on Greene and Victoria as well. This park has everything you'd want in a park, and more: a fountain and kiddie playground equipment? Check. Many elegant benches by stately trees? Check. A small man-made ""creek"" and larger grassy areas for kids to run around and play, or for picnics? Check. Meandering paths to walk, and an abundance of birds and squirrels to observe? Check!What makes this park of particular significance (other than its location and longstanding history) is the wealth of resources here: the elegant, old Westmount Library is located on the park's western side, as is its connected, gorgeous Victorian glass greenhouse. On the far south edge of the park by St. Catherine are the tennis courts and Westmount pools and indoor ice skating and hockey rinks (note: a new Westmount sport center is presently under construction, so there is a lot of building going on right now. But this sporting center, according to the plans and pictures I've seen, looks like it it's going to be pretty darn amazing, with a children's pool in addition to a lap pool, and other modern amenities). ¬†There might be a new doggie are to the park, too, once all the construction is done. I like seeing all the kids in the park, and many summer day camps bring their young campers here to play. It's always vibrant, with the sounds of children laughing, and older folks sitting on benches and chatting with friends. Young and old alike visit this park regularly, as they have through many Montreal family's generations. It's everything a park should be."
Westmount Park is a great place to come on a sunny day to get some fresh air. ¬†When I lived downtown I used to always make sure my morning runs passed through this park because I just love it. ¬†There is plenty of green space to sit and enjoy the weather and a big pond for scenery. ¬†You can also enjoy a leisurely stroll through the winding paths that go through this park. ¬†For the kids there are fountains to play in come summer time and swing sets too. ¬†For the athletes there are tennis courts and a soccer field where you can work up a sweat. ¬†I believe they also do Shakespeare in the park here but you might want to double check that one. ¬†Anyways to wrap things up this park is definitely a good place to come on a nice day to get out and make the most of the weather.
"Another amazing park. I am just amazed at all the fantastic parks scattered throughout the city. ¬†This one has a huge open green space and various playgrounds including a small baseball field, dog park, jungle gyms, swings, and splash park that looks so enticing on this summer day.There is also a lovely war memorial for those who died fighting in both World Wars and the Korean War. ¬†Doesn't hurt to squeeze in a history lesson for the kids...or adults for that matter."
"Verily the sanctum sanctorum of N.D.G. The holy of holies of parks. Parc Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce or N.D.G. Park or just plain and simple GIROUARD PARC is just about the best park in the neighbourhood. Call it what you will because wise people call this place by many names and call it what you want because you have free human agency. Yes, indeed, denizens of the good hood of Lady Grace, sometimes we may be No Dame Good but we sure do know damn well how to chillax on a beautiful Montreal day. Yes, citizens of the Deeg, small and large, young and old, squirrel and human, all seek refuge in this park to congregate (whilst respecting the public health and safety protocols to reduce the transmission of COVID-19) and have an excellent time. Yes, the who's who of NDG chill at this park; you've got Rebecca Anne Clark feeding the squirrels sunflower seeds whilst sitting under her favourite Maple tree with her stylish lawn chair, you've got Sarah Ring and Aurora Robinson organising the next NDG Portchfest, you've got Christopher Brown speaking truth to power, you've got elected officials like NDG borough councillor Peter McQueen riding his bike and talking to constituents, you've got the guy who does an improvised yoga/parkour hybrid, you've got the dude who practices his LARPing with a gigantic and extremely heavy wooden sword, you've got the skateboarders filming their skate videos, you've got the dude playing the bagpipes, you've got the couple low-key having sex on the grass in broad daylight, you've got the dog walkers in the dog park, and you've got many other people to people watch. There are lots of amenities in the park and in the vicinity. Yes, this park has got it all and that's not even the beginning of it. Please get a whole grain baguette or pita, some houmous, some vege p√¢t√©, some ferments and pickles, and some delicious fruit. Bring a little rose kombucha. Have a little picnic and in the words of KC and the Sunshine Band, ""do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight."""
"Perfect little park tucked in Little Italy across from Napoletana. This is an excellent option for picnics, especially if you happen to have a set of balls for petanque or bocce (I do not, and am terrible at these games, but I enjoy the heft and roll nevertheless.) There are also excellent hiding places here, ivy covered arbours and the like, if hide and go seek is more your speed. This is a small park, but extra sweet."
"I love this little park! It's quaint, gets loads of sun throughout the day and has plenty of benches, if you're not one to sit around in the grass! It also has a bocce ball area - cause no park in Little Italy is complete without - and is located near some of the neighbourhood's finest italian bakeries & coffee shops, in case your sweet tooth takes over or you get thirsty. It's really a fine spot to just chill and take in the summer sun."
"This place is amazingly gorgeous. The structure is huge, just being near it feels extremely peaceful. When walking in, the signs are very clear and it's easy to get through on your own in case you don't want to go through a tour. The view is spectacular being that it is so high up so I recommend going with a camera! Mass was being held in both languages and the signs are available for future times and programming. We noticed that construction is taking place so we are excited to return when everything is renovated. I'm sure it will be breathtaking. If you are in the area and interested in staying in touch with beautiful catholic structures I 100% recommend stopping by. Uber is decent price ($17USD) from downtown Montreal."
"This place has some really beautiful scenic views of Montr√©al from up on high on the Mountain. But ... Roman Catholicism is a death cult that condones pedophilia. The Roman Catholic Church is known to condone pedophilia by protecting priests who rape and abuse children, and commit other acts of child sexual assault. The Church does not report these priests to authorities, instead they actively conceal their criminal actions by transferring the pedophile priest to another parish or congregation. In many circumstances the Church will protect and even enable pedophile priests by pressuring survivors of childhood rape and childhood sexual assault to reach a legal settlement which also precludes survivors from speaking out about their trauma. These non-disclosure agreements serve to protect pedophile priests from the criminal justice system. There is also a creepy ritual cannibalism aspect to their worship practices. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely patriarchal and problematic institution which practices extreme sexism; women are not allowed to participate equally with men, women are barred from the clergy, and are barred from holding any positions of power or influence within the organisation. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely corrupt, wealthy, and powerful institution; it wields influence like a weapon and inherently acts as an organised crime syndicate. The Roman Catholic Church also failed to speak out against the Holocaust and continues to be silent about the role it played as Nazi collaborator. The Roman Catholic Church also obscures and obfuscates it's role in many other genocides; the Church created, participated in, promoted and condoned, the genocide and exile of Jews and Muslims during the Inquisition. The Catholic Church is responsible for mass murder, forced conversion, and genocide during the Crusades as well as during the colonial conquests in North America, South America, and Central America. Today, the Catholic Church presently promotes missionary work seeking the mass conversion of Indigenous peoples around the world. The Church seeks to destroy traditional Indigenous ways of life and Indigenous spiritual practices. The Catholic Church in Bolivia has actively collaborated in the coup d'√©tat that has illegally deposed and exiled President Evo Morales, the legitimate and democratically elected head of state. Mexico's president has written to Pope Francis to ask for an apology for the Catholic church's role in the oppression of indigenous people in the Spanish conquest 500 years ago. The request was made in a two-page letter that also asked the Vatican to temporarily return several ancient indigenous manuscripts held in its library, ahead of next year's 500-year anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.If you're looking for a philosophy or spiritual practice which promotes peace and compassion, try a different denomination of Christianity like the Unitarian Church, or the United Church, or Unitarian Universalism. You can even venture outside of Christianity. Jesus was a Jew so why not explore Jewish thought and philosophy; Reform Judaism is an excellent denomination. Kabbalah mysticism is excellent spirituality as well. Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism, is also an excellent philosophical tradition. You can go further East with Confucianism and Taoism. And last but not least are the oldest philosophies in the world, the Indian schools of though which promote compassion and nonviolence, such as Sanatana Dharma (a term that describes what we in the West call by the overly simplified exonym: Hinduism) and of course Buddhist philosophies."
"This place is Gorgeous and definitely a must !!!My sister drove all the way to the top of this mountain where this basilica is located. Such an impecable and peaceful place. We loved it and felt amazing, plus the architecture is so pretty. There's no entrance fee and there are different floors. We didn't have time to go to the museum but there's one there too.At their gift shop you can find any type of great keepsakes and Catholic things like books, bibles, accessories, frames, and much more. The service here was perfect and the parking was free."
"Been here at least a half a dozen times over the last 20 years (visits even predate YELP) but this is the first time I have reviewed. This minor basilica of the Catholic Church (the largest church in Canada) is dedicated to the life and times of St. Joseph due to the devotion of a little Holy Cross Brother by the name of Andre Bessette - now St. Andre because of his 2010 canonization in Rome. St. Andre is the first and only member of the Congregation of Holy Cross to be canonized; the Congregation is also the founder of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. The basilica in Quebec Canada sits atop Mount Royal and dominates the sight-lines of all of Montreal. This basilica - The Oratory - began with a little chapel in 1904 on the mountainside which arose because of Brother Andre's work. His day job was as the porter and doorman across the street at the Notre Dame College of the Holy Cross order - a position he retained for over 40 years. The lower church (the crypt church) was finished in 1917, the cornerstone of the basilica was laid in 1924, construction of the upper church (the basilica) was stopped by the Great Depression and not restarted until 1937. The basilica officially opened in 1956, and the interior was finished in 1967 - just in time for the opening of Expo 67 (the centennial celebration of the Canadian Confederation).The basilica is a wonder to visit. Entrance is free. This venue is generally crowded as it is one of the most popular tourist sites in Canada ... but do visit. They are going through a rehab right now to reconstruct the parking lots and access point into the basilica - but even though it is crowded and messy, do visit if you have the chance. This is one of the wonders of the Catholic Church and, no matter what your particular religious bent, a shrine of major import. Recommended."
"Went here during our trip to Montreal. ¬†There are lots of steps to walk up to go inside and we saw a woman running up/down them as part of an exercise regime. ¬†I think just walking up the steps is exercise for most people. ¬†It is Canada's largest church and is reputed to have the largest dome in the world! ¬†There is some construction going on and from the sounds of things, it will continue for some time. ¬†The drawings show that you will be able to go up into the dome when it is finished. ¬†There is already quite a view from the middle level of the church! ¬†Although there is lots of beauty, it is not an interior style that appeals much to me nor the rest of my family. ¬†You can see and hear a fantastic pipe organ and concerts are given on Sunday's for free along with a large screen projector, but I have no idea what that means. ¬†While we were there, someone was playing the organ, but not doing the best job. ¬†Surely if you are an organist, you would love to have the opportunity to play there. ¬†I really enjoy a large hall with hundreds of candles that you could light for other people or intentions. ¬†Surprisingly, when you look at the candles through your cellphone, you realize that words are spelled out in the red or white containers for the candles. ¬†Messages of biblical meaning. ¬†It was very nice to see that touch. ¬†Also, in that hall, there were hundreds of crutches hanging up which represents all the people who had been healed there through the years. ¬†There was a museum, gift shop and a cafe, too."
Loved this place on a crisp fall day! The view from the top onto the great city of Montr√©al was breathtaking. Very relaxing and interesting tour. Check out the gift shop for inexpensive knickknacks!
"This catholic church is huge, & beautiful. It rests atop Montreal; & has the most amazing view of the city. There's no charge to visit. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're visiting. Pick a day where the weather is nice, & that'll add to the experience. The building has 8 floors, elevators; & is handicap accessible. I believe there are tours given, as I saw staff walking around with visitors. There's ¬†currently construction going on outside the church, but shouldn't affect your visit in any way."
"This was on our city pass, and although it is a little far from main downtown montreal, it is easy to find by metro.After exiting the metro station, we walked a few short blocks through a small town with a cluster of stores and restaurants. This was the first street I encountered that had signs to point us to the direction of the landmarks we wanted to see. As we turned right after crossing the street, it was only a short distance where we could see the oratory. Entering the area towards the oratory was a landscape of beautiful flowers and grass.Then we had to walk up lots of concrete stairs, but it wasn't too bad because after a short walk of stairs, it flattened out to rest and take pictures of the city ¬†and oratory. The middle stair had signs at French, and it was for those who walk up and pray on the stairs. There were many entrances to the oratory, and so much to see. ¬†It took us at least 4 hours to go through the ¬†whole 4 floors of the oratory and garden. The stations of the cross garden was a very peaceful walk up a semi steep road, with beautiful statues to reflect on, ending with water pouring out a golden lamb into a pond, and a view of the side of the oratory.Although the oratory closes at 8:30, we missed the museum because the museum closes at 4:30pm.Lots of parking, and if you do drive, you at least are able to bypass the stairs going towards the oratory."
"The St. Josephs Oratory of Mount Royal was an amazing experience. ¬† When you first get to their main entry, you will experience a bit of construction on the landscape and parking lot walk-ups to the Oratory. During our visit, these are the must sees: the Votive Chapel, the Crypt Church, the Terrace on the mezzanine level offering an amazing view of the University of Notre Dame, the Garden of of the Way of the Cross, the Basilica itself is truly remarkable. ¬†A final must see is the Original Chapel which is on the backside of the Oratory. Just exit out on the side of the Oratory closest to the lunch area. ¬†We found the Garden of the Way of the Cross to be extremely relaxing, cool breezes, and quite reflective."
"Beautiful basilica and grounds! Parking is just 5$ for the day, there is a lower parking and a higher parking in front of the entrance of the basilica. Took us about 1.5 hours to do a tour on our own. The views from the terraces are exceptional and even better than the belvedere on Mont-Royal. The gardens are nice and peaceful and worth a walk through."
"Definitely worth seeing while in Montreal. You can see an awesome view of Montreal while on the top of the Mont Royal. I've been here before when I was a kid, but now back at it as an adult it was just lovely. Get your walking shoes on because in order to enter you have to climb the mountain and the stairway is lengthy. For me wearing a dress that day not the best idea I must say. Because what's cool was the fact that they had three separate rows of stairways. The one that stood out to me was the wooden one where you'd have to make the climb to the top on your knees which represents the sacrifice our fathers made before us and your taking that journey and if you make a wish and succeed the climb your wish comes true. (Next time must where jeans lol) Saint Joseph' Oratory is huge with 6 levels. 1- Welcome center-Votive chapel, Brother Andres Tomb, Statue of the Virgin, Saint Joseph Oil, Crypt Church, and Hall of Renovation Project, 3- Rest area, 4-Brother Andre's Heart and display on his life. 5- The Oratory Museum, 6- Basilica, Original Chapel, Saint Andre Bessette Chapel.Parking is free if you are a student of the University of Montreal or $5 if not and admission is free to the church. However the museum inside is I recall $5 per person.We saw the outdoor garden which depicted Christ's journey with numerous statues and nice horticulture. It was peaceful and serene. We also saw the museum which housed unique displays of nativity scenes throughout the world which was really cool to see. They also had art sculptures, old town maps of Montreal, and beautiful paintings. The chapels and church's are just amazing."
"Came here early in the morning and was treated to an uninhibited view of the Oratory. It wasn't very crowded; there were mainly locals getting a good cardio workout running up and down the stairs.Wow, let me just say that the Oratory is an impressive site to behold on top of the hill. Despite its humble beginnings in the early 1900s, the oratory has undergone many expansions. It is very well maintained and you'll be rewarded with a beautiful view of Montreal at the top of the steps.Speaking of steps, feeling like you've been a horrible human being lately? You can repent your sins by climbing up the stairs of penance on your knees.Due to time constraints, I didn't get a chance to visit the inside, but I'd love to come back to learn more about the history and architecture.Overall, an awe-inspiring view even for the non-religious. Worth a stop if you got some extra time on your itinerary."
"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit in Montreal, Quebec. This is the first contemporary Basilica I have visited. Very interesting architecture and gardens.It is Canada's largest church. Its dome is the third-largest of its kind in the world after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. In 1924, the construction of the basilica of Saint Joseph's Oratory was commenced; it was finally completed in 1967.Also a great gift shop here."
Now THIS was my favorite part of my very first trip to Montreal. ¬†This church is amazing!When you first enter there is a tribute to Brother Andre' & his vision for the church.Then after you exit the church take 2 escalators up to the sanctuary and there is another beautiful church to await youTwo churches in one!Phenomenal!!I partake in Holy CommunionBeautiful service Very helpful people who will tell you how to get to the other sanctuary I'm not Catholic and I enjoyed the service immensely!Enjoy!!!
"The Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mont-Royal is an amazing church with a rich, interesting history. The architecture is incredible and awe-inspiring, and it definitely gives you a sense of wonderment. I'm sure if I lived in Montreal I would only attend Mass here on occasion because the grandeur is so eye catching that it would distract me. But as a destination and a thing to see in Montreal, this is truly a special one. There are some stairs, and an elevator that cuts out the elevation, and the lookout points have some incredible views. There is much to explore at the Oratory, so be sure and plan ahead so you see it all.It is Canada's largest church, and a national shrine. and a reliquary in the church museum contains Brother Andre's heart the Saint who founded the church as a small chapel back in 1904."
This is a must visit when in the Montreal area. ¬†It is a magnificent and impressive place. ¬†They do such a great job about providing information in order to fully enjoy your visit and ensure you don't miss out on any of it. ¬†The hall of votives has thousands of candles and it is a beautiful and peaceful site. ¬†Learning about Brother Andre who drew thousands of people to him which led to miracles of people being healed. ¬†He was even named a saint in 2010. ¬†St. Jospeh's is a testament to his life and is a lovely tribute to him.
"Even if you visit no other Church in all of Montreal, this includes Notre Dame, visit this one. There, I said it. (Please don't burn me at the stake).First off, the land that this place rests upon is huge. If you're driving, be sure to try and get a spot at the highest point possible. If you're walking, good luck. Contrary to prior reviews, parking was free for me (New Year's Special?). The parking lot attendant/traffic enforcer did not ask me for money and I saw no kiosk to pay for parking. Oh well! (Trust me, I more than made up for it at the gift shop).So much beauty and history! I probably missed the guided tour, but roaming around this place with its multiple escalators was so fascinating to me. It's truly a ""wow"" experience if you stand at the highest point and look down.I hope to attend Mass here one day; hope it's in English!"
"A great time here at the Oratory. Parking is $5 per vehicle, which in itself is a steal for Montreal. You can park on the lower level and work your way up, or drive to the top and park there and work your way down. Keep in mind that the parking on top is limited. After not being able to find a space up top, we drove back down to the bottom where there was tons of parking. We worked our way up, which included a decent amount of stairs. Note that once inside, there are a few escalators and even an elevator which makes life easier. The oratory is great with lots to see. The experience itself is free. There is a gift shop on the top with lots of great items included rosaries. Throughout the oratory you can also purchase little guides for a $2 donation. There is a chapel and a shrine area. Behind the shrine is a tomb, which was interesting to see. Also the views fro the top are great, as are the views from the bottom. Be sure to stop along each level and take pics. Overall we had a great time here. There is so much to learn and see here, with technically no fees or admission costs. That being said, be generous and donate or spend some $$ at the gift shop. Enjoy!"
"My birthplace is filled with beautiful churches. ¬†St. Joseph's Oratory is one of the best! ¬†This Catholic Church is one of the ""must visit"" destinations in Montreal. ¬†I took my wife here during the off peak season so it was not crowded. ¬†Most of the time I have been here, there have been busloads on f people.If you start your self-tour at the bottom of the hill, then you will be burning some calories. ¬†Better have some comfortable walking shoes. ¬†We were amazed to see some people going up the long staircase on their knees (stopping to say a prayer on each step). ¬†St. Joseph's Oratory is a pilgrimage site for many Catholics. ¬†There are a couple of chapels here. ¬†A mass was being conducted in French at one of these chapels. ¬†The Church is truly impressive both inside and outside. ¬†It is massive. ¬†Plenty of photo ops here. ¬†Make sure to grab one of the pamphlets that gives more information and details about St. Joseph's. ¬†There is so much to see and admire here. ¬†Unfortunately, we did not see the Gardens Of The Way Of The Cross. ¬†It was closed for the season. ¬†My wife and I are Catholic so we really loved our trip here! ¬†It was an awesome 4 hours spent here for us. ¬†Does not matter if you are religious or not, one can still find something to admire."
Beautiful settingLocated near Mont Royal. St. Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal sit on top of a hill.It is the largest shrine dedicated to Saint Joseph in the world.
"One of the joys of living in CDN is the close proximity to one of Montreal's iconic sites, L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph, perched along the southwestern side of Mont-Royal. If you are a senseless running enthusiast like myself and wish to torture yourself trying to run up those steps, be forewarned. That said, the reward at the top is worth it. On occasion I've ventured into the actual church itself, which is lovely. I'm somewhat of a recovering catholic, but still know my Our Fathers and Hail Marys, and can probably recite the Apostle's Creed on cue. On a non-mass day, sitting in a pew in the spacious Basilica offers perhaps one of Montreal's most peaceful settings. Speaking of which, there is a prayer garden outside (only open during the warmer months) where one might venture into to seek inner peace. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the candle hall, where visitors can light a candle and offer a prayer (for a small fee). But the best feature of Saint-Joseph's is of course the view. On warmer days, I've sat on the steps just outside the Basilica and seen the most beautiful Montreal sunsets. Even this winter day, I still got to enjoy the view from the snow-covered stairs. If you do come during the colder times, definitely bring proper winter gear because that wind will slap you across the face like a scorned grandmother."
"We took a taxi to the top then called a taxi for pickup at the top. The place has lots of levels(5?)which are accessible via stairs, escalator and elevator. The church view is from the street outside. They have a gift shop and a restaurant which served limited but good food at a good price. The basilica is free to enter. The church have stained windows I think and the front is OK but not as good as the basilica in downtown."
"My family travelled all the way to Noryhern America , found this place, ¬†and not disappointed. Very nice basilica ! If you are a catholic, you'll be happy to know that Saint Andr√© 's tomb, who was canonized in 2010 is here. In here, you have a scenic view of Montreal . Parking is quite confusing because it is not on what's in GOS. We ask the locals and they directed us the the right spot. Montreal traffic is horrible! Small streets and lots of constructions."
"Skip this church and spend your time at Notre Dame instead. It's free, but what a letdown. It's so dreary, dim, and depressing inside!!! There's wooden statues of the twelve apostles, and that's prettyyyy much it. I felt like I was in a scene of the Da Vinci Code without the interesting stuff. There was a small organ ""concert,"" but it was just a few notes playing. View of the city was cool, but not worth making the trek here."
"This was like a pilgrimage.On a gigantic hill sits a large church with a museum dedicated to a priest named Brother Andre.They have his waxed likeness, like the wax museum, but even creepier they even have his mummified heart in a jar with a prayer that you can say for a blessing.This church is beautiful, and there are plenty of candles to light with a fee of course.Along the was are crutches and canes from those who have been healed.A great destination for anyone who's religious or is just interested in churches and buildings in general.And for all of you lazy people who don't want to walk a half a mile uphill there's a free shuttle!"
"Loved going to this place as a kid, when I grew up in Montreal! Every time I make it a point to go! Love this place!"
"Amazing structure!! ¬†Definitely worth a visit. ¬†There are buses, elevators and escalators to take you to the basilica, but if your up to it, take the stairs all the way. ¬†Don't forget to check out the blessed sacrament to the rear of the pulpit. ¬†Very special place, even for non-Catholics. And the views are picturesque."
"I've seen the Oratory all my life but never visited it until my friend from BC came into town for a few days and wanted to visit it. It truly felt like a genuine pilgrimage. Located near the base of Mont-Royal, you have to continuously climb up halfway up the hill and at some points it's pretty steep! Parking isn't free but there's a lot of available spots.... at least on a cloudy day that I visited it. The church is really beautiful and it holds a special place for the local population with ""Frere Andre"", a local saint reputed to heal the sick and crippled. The design of the Oratory is pretty on the outside as well as inside and the view from the Oratory towards Montreal is very pretty. There are more beautiful churches in the world but nonetheless visiting is free of cost with many smaller places to visit such as ""Frere Andre"" old home. I recommend to visit, to attend a service if you're the religious type and most importantly enjoy the sights."
"This was a great highlight on the city of Montreal! Beautifully designed on the mountain making it a must see for sure! The other top attraction of the Oratory is the garden outside of it telling the story of Jesus Christ, the crucifixion and the resurrection! Leaves you speechless! Even in the rain it is well worth the stop. It can be a lot of walking but there are several benches along the way if you need a break."
Great attraction in city Montreal. Inner design was fantastic and beautiful. Worth to visit this place
"What a beautiful, majestic church! This is Canada's largest church and a pilgrimage site that was built in a span of 60 years following the vision of Saint Andr√© Bessette, C.S.C., who healed thousands of people during his life and to whom at least 2 million pilgrims still offer up thir prayers every year.The basilica is up on a hill and there is a beautiful and scenic stairway completely worth the walk to the top. Many pilgrims climb the stairs on their knees.This is the world's largest church dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother Andr√© credited all his reported miracles. There is a huge display wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the Oratoire and were healed, at the point that Brother Andr√© in 1982 was canonized saint a few years ago. The visit takes a few hours as there is a lot to see. There is a room with thousands of candles and a museum dedicated to Brother Andr√©, where it is possible to see his heart, which he requested as a protection for the basilica. I felt in awe at seeing so many people paying their respects.The view from the top is breathtaking but I would suggest getting here very early in the morning, since there are always too many visitors."
It was .so amazing..to finally found one if my dream destination.So grabd so lovely so Holy..one of a kind. Felt so blessed and comforted and embraced.During my visit I LOST MY WALLET....with all my card..credit card..big amount of money..my most precious wallet..may prayer books..my ID pictures...I felt so down and so lost....worried that even some church guards cant speak english....how am I gonna tell them I LOST my wallet. Even lost and wanna cry....I told God! Sorry for not being so careful...I thought the House of God is my refuge....YES it is ! No question.I am still thankful that those I lost I am able to recover hopefully soon!Pls guys be extra carefull with your belongings!God bless us all
A beautiful and inspiring church with multiple spiritual areas to experience. ¬†Don't miss out on the less obvious areas to explore. ¬†The climb looks daunting but well worth the effort.
This is an amazing basilica and I highly recommend visiting. ¬†I think all visitors will enjoy it regardless of faith.
"Worth visiting for the view alone. If you're so inclined, attend service. Be sure to leave a donation, and light a candle.Even though I'm not terribly religious - I jive spiritual - there's something about the art that sends chills up my spine. This place is designed to make one feel small, and very, very mortal, and it does a good job of it.Visit the gardens, toss a coin into the pool, and meditate on that mortality."
"Qu√©bec Providence has many beautiful Roman Catholic Churches on the North America East Coast.Brother Andr√© Tomb and Heart are located on the premises for public viewing. ¬†Blessed Brother Andr√© is the founder of Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount-Royal. ¬†The Basilica houses concerts, communal prayers in addition to Mass. ¬†There were no Mass in session when our bus tour group came for a very brief visit of half-hour. ¬†I was able to achieve inner peace after this week's hardships and struggles of both my professional and personal life through the power of prayer.There is plentiful supply of Holy Water open to the public upon worshipper's entrance and departure."
"This was a great site to see. It was very ethereal there and we went on a sunday afternoon and there was mass going on which was lovely to participate in even if you aren't catholic. The view for the Oratoire Saint Joseph was phenomenal. The view is beautiful and you can see all of montreal with an unobstructed view from the terrace. If you are visiting montreal, this place is a must visit.Inside you can see the tomb of Joseph and light vigil candles and pray for the saints."
"The church itself and the famous view make for a great visit - but make sure to take the time to walk through the outdoor garden/ Passion statues, that was actually the most memorable part for me."
"The church was really out of the way and looked mediocre in photos so I wasn't expecting much. When I arrived, I was blown away by how beautiful and HUGE it was. There was a band playing music on the steps, pretty sunset, and perfect atmosphere. If you can't afford a trip to Europe, just come to Montreal for this church. Made me fall in love with Montreal, I can't wait to go back."
"I hate exercise. Okay, that's a lie. I hate LONG PERIODS OF EXERCISE. So I have no idea why I thought huffing and puffing my way up Mount Royal on a blisteringly warm May day was a splendid idea. But i'm glad I did.After finally reaching the top, I decided to pop into mass - it was fantastic. ¬†Everyone is going to say that the interior of the church is dull or whatever, and I can understand that. It isn't incredibly ornate, but it is still worth a trip inside considering how large the church is. A man inside (who felt the need to call me ""sugar lips"") said it was the largest church in Canada. The so-called observation deck is the highlight. You can get a fantastic view of the city up there. Montreal doesn't have the ~best~ skyline, but I was in awe of the city."
"It was -16C, we could see the building from a far. It was tall and grand. We passed through the vast garden. Walked through some steps. We enter via side entrance. So far it looked like modern building with all the elevators.Finally we see the inside of the Oratory. The building is huge, gigantic, when we walked in, we felt as if we were two dwarves because of the extremely high ceiling, art deco influences, straight clean lines, minimal ornament, cold stark feeling.It seems like the designer was trying to impose a grand religious aura, but with tourist wandering and clicking their camera, children running around, buzzing sound from cleaning machine, this place of worship turn into some tourist attraction instead.It's free and for those who prefer not to climb those steps, there is free shuttle that takes you right to the entrance."
"Location: On Queen Mary, east of D√©carie Boulevard. The closest subway stops are C√¥te-des-Neiges (Orange) and Snowdown (Blue).The Place: Even if you're not religious, this is still worth a visit. Situated at the top of Mount Royal, you can see the dome from a distance on a sunny day - but when you're actually AT the Oratory, the view of the city from the lookout is spectacular. Architecturally, this is a beautiful place. The church itself is nothing special to look at compared to Notre-Dame or some of the churches I saw in Italy, but the energetic pull of the place is something else. You will see many a devout person attending mass here, lighting candles for a loved one or, more importantly, making their pilgrimage to the oratory, from the bottom of the parking lot, up the stairs, on their knees. No, I'm not kidding. St. Joseph's Oratory was home to the now famous Fr√®re Andr√©, who was known to heal the crippled, the paralyzed - you name it. You will find walls filled with crutches inside the church, as a testament to all those he healed. You can also visit his teeny tiny home, and see the sacred room where his heart is kept. No, I'm not kidding. Additional info: They have a large gift shop for those who want to buy rosaries and other religious goods, including holy water.Price point: I personally don't remember ever having to pay to access the oratory."
"Avoid coming on Sundays - it's incredibly busy! On another note, beautiful views, has both modern yet traditional architecture which makes it very beautiful! You usually have to pay for parking, so be prepared."
We were here over the Thanksgiving weekend(American) and we got chills just staring at the building. It is gigantic and beautiful!! We arrived too late so we did not have enough time to see each floor however during our 1 hour 30 mins stay it was just breath taking. No words can describe how beautiful this place is. You must visit this place when you are in Montreal. Also the view from this place is spectacular.
"After seeing the Olympic Stadium, Old Town Montreal, and now there is the one historic church of Montreal, Canada that... I ¬†thought that, I would not see this old historic church and it was a part of our Montreal tour which the day fell on a Sunday... When, I first walked inside to the St Joseph's Oratory... I have to say that this church is really really old with the old traditional style brick settings in some areas inside of the St Joseph's Oratory... If I was to go back and revisit Montreal...The St Joseph's Oratory is the one place that... I don't mind revisiting again and a very historical landmark of Montreal, Canada!!!"
It's a really old Catholic Church with a phenomenal view of the city. I walked here from my Neiges (neighborhood) Airbnb. Worth the trip for a panoramic view of city.
"We took a short walk here from the place we were staying around 11 at night. Wow! It was incredible. Neither my boyfriend or I are religious, but we wanted to see the oratory as it is touted to be one of the largest churches in the world. It was beautiful. Would have been nice to see it in the daylight but our evening stroll up to the top was pretty magical and we enjoyed being the only ones there. There was something very special about the night there. We would have liked to have been able to see inside, but wouldn't trade our private night time stroll on the grounds - very cool! I would highly recommend checking this place out, it's quite humbling."
"Looks very impressive from the outside, but I was disappointed on the interior of the main part. Very blah. Go down to look at the heart of the guy that started it. Creepy!Also, we were approached by people outside asking for money. One guy had a whole story about his wife having cancer and how he needed help. I wanted to tell him to go to the church and ask for help. I think he was just looking to scam tourists.There are much better churches to visit in the area including Christ Church Cathedral."
"Last weekend was my first visit to St Joseph's even though I've been coming to Montreal since I was a kid. I'm not a religious person so this place didn't have the same effect on my as it would for say, a practicing Catholic. The architecture is nice and seemed very modern on the inside considering it was built in the late 20's. It's a very large building with lots of different chapels. There's always a mass going in one of them somewhere. The main cathedral is over-the-top big and I'm assuming is supposed to make you feel small compared to the hugeness of the catholic mafia... err I mean, god.Since we went in winter, the gardens and other outdoor areas were closed for the season so I didn't get to see all of it. Overall, for me, it was a nice building and I took nice photos.Oh and don't miss the hardcore pilgrims climbing the stairs on their knees! Crazy!"
"St. Joseph's Oratory is a breathtaking sanctuary built by the newly canonized Saint in the Catholic Church, Brother Andre, in dedication to St. Joseph. I've visited the Oratory many times, and each time the grand splendour of the building grasped me. Many stairs are to be climbed in order to enter, or you can drive up- the Oratory is placed in a high hill. Inside, the atmosphere is quiet & spiritual. Pilgrims are in prayers and Catholic Mass is held within the crypt of the church many times a day. There is an info desk where you can pick up an ""arrow guide book""- $2, in order to give yourself a tour without getting lost.What you'll find in the Oratory:The Lamp Hallway- This is a warm, dim-lighted hallway with over thousands of vigil lights that you can light for $1. This hallway has many people in prayer.Brother Andre's Tomb- Connected to the lamp hallway, rests the remains of Brother Andre who died on Jan 6, 1937. Here also, people are silent in prayer and veneration towards the newly canonized saint.The Crypt Church- Simple yet beautiful, this is the main place where the services are held throughout the day. I couldn't help but notice the beautiful statue of the main alter of St. Joseph and the marble and oak used in the crypt, very beautiful.Terrance on the Roof- The Oratory has a huge terrance that allows people to have a panoramic view of all the North-Western area of Montreal. You can see the Laurentian Mountains, lake St. Louis and St. Lawrence River. This is a must see and is breathtaking!Brother Andre Wax Display- There is an exhibit showcasing Brother Andre's doorkeeper's lodge, office, hospital, and his preserved heart!The Way of the Cross Garden- A beautiful garden on a hill shows off the natural environment and beauty. As you climb the hill, you see marble religious statues depicting each station of the cross. This garden is outside but attached to the Oratory.The Museum- For around $4 (adult fare) you can see the museum that has an impressive collection of religious art from the Renaissance period, and so much more.There is so much more: Brother Andre's room, original chapel, the souvenir shop (great variety of religious articles, medals and more for very reasonable prices), the cafeteria (offers full course meals), and the Carillion- largest church bells in North America. I had the opportunity to hear them before Mass, the quality and sound of the bells is outstanding!The entire Oratory staff is kind and helpful. The grounds and Oratory itself are maintained very well. I can't wait to come back here again!St. Joseph's Oratory is visited by pilgrims around the world in the thousands each year. This is truly a must see in Montreal!"
"We took advantage of UA's weekend special to visit Montreal over the weekend. ¬†The weather got bad after we book the trip and hotel. ¬†It was raining most the days we are in Montreal. ¬†After taking the bus tour to Quebec in the rain on Sunday, we planned out two different trips for Monday. ¬†One for rain one for no-rain.No rain when we got up so we walked from our hotel and took bus 165 from Guy street to go to the St. Joseph's Oratory. ¬† I used Google map to plan out the bus/walk trip. ¬†It was a lot nicer to walk on Rue Sherbrooke because you pass by a lot of museum and hotels than Boul De Maisonneuve. ¬†The bus ride was not bad. ¬†We met other people who also on their way to the Oratory. ¬†The bus driver told us when to get off and how to walk to the Oratory. ¬†You can also see the tall Oratory when you get off the bus. ¬†Bus 165 did not drop you off in front of the Oratory. ¬†Bus 166 and 51 are the one in the front of the Oratory.When we took the 3.5 hours Montreal bus tour on Saturday afternoon, the tour guide told us there were a lot of steps to go up to the Oratory and it is not recommended. ¬†We had choice between Oratory ($5) and the Botanical Garden ($17.75). ¬†Since it may rain so I picked Oratory. ¬† I learned from past touring experiences it is better to take the ""road"" for car not the stairs for people from our Quebec trip. ¬†I saw the ""shuttle"" sign as soon as you got into the gate at the Oratory next to the info center so we took the shuttle up to the Oratory so I did not have to walk any steps!The Oratory only had 3-guided tour ($5) per day, one at 10 and one at 13:30. ¬†We got there at 10:40 so we paid $2 for a self-guided book. ¬†You can also get a free map if you don't want to buy the book. ¬†I paid $0.50 for a bottle for the holy water near the entrance where the shuttle dropped you off. The inside is a little dark so you cannot really read the book. ¬†We ended up just walk around where we wanted to go without using the map or the guide book. ¬† We found #9 The Way of the Cross and the Gardens of the Oratory right the way. ¬†This was a total surprised since we only expected to see a church not a garden for our trip. ¬†The pool/fountain was closed for cleaning. ¬†A lot of up hill walking, no steps! ¬†I was so happy we took the shuttle so I saved my legs for the garden.My daughter loved #7 The terrace on the roof. ¬†She was able to take a lot of different photos of Montreal with her fancy camera. ¬†This is a good place to read the guide book so you will not miss any exhibits and learned about the history. ¬†I made the mistake until we got home and read the book.Warning - #8 Display-Brother Andre because they have ""The heart of Brother Andre"" on display there! ¬†We were glade we missed this.We took the ""road"" and ""steps"" on our way down so it was not so bad on my legs. ¬†We took bus 51 across the street from the Oratory and got off at the Metro stop to take the orange line (Montmorency direction) to Old Montreal - Place-D'Armes.This experience is very different from Notre Dame. ¬†This was my favorite place to visit in Montreal so don't be scared off by the tour guide about the 100 steps to the Oratory!"
"Driving in from the south, the imposing dome of St. Joseph's is visible from 20 km out - the first visual confirmation that you're getting close to Montreal. For a tourist, this hulking presence is almost impossible to resist, and all the guidebooks confirm that the church is a Top 10 attraction, so of course you make time for a visit. As you pull into the parking lot, picking your way through tour buses packed with pilgrims, you're struck again by the sheer mass of the building perched atop one of the highest points in the city. As you climb the interminable stairs up the side of the mountain, you start to anticipate the architectural beauties that await you at the summit. Several hundred calories later, you finally enter the sanctuary, ready for a payoff that never really comes. Turns out the ooh's and ah's of St. Joseph's are mostly generated down below. At the top, the views are endless, but not especially awe-inspiring, because you're looking away from the Montreal skyline. And the inside of the church is nearly Spartan in its simplicity, with very little to distract your eye from the huge dome overhead. What little effort is made at decoration tends toward a monochromatic, slightly depressing style with a nod to Chagall."
"Feeling pain in those knees? Can't walk straight due to back pain? There's a room in the oratory covered with crutches from the thousands of people who have made pilgrimages and was purportedly cured. But if making your way up 100 steps on your knees is not your thing, take the escalator and enjoy the view from this gorgeous basilica. The church museum has a display of nativity scenes from all over the world....France is ultra modern, Martinique was all coconuts and China looked like it belonged in a fish tank. There's also a display of select scenes from the life of St. Joseph and the reliquary houses the heart of Brother Andre. And you thought the occult was weird."
Loved this place! I went Saturday night and couldn't go all the way to the basilica since it was already closed but liked it so much that I came back on Sunday and was so lucky to be there at mass!I jus loved the place and the feeling of being there! Beautiful and magnificent place! Definitely a must!
"A staggering work of architecture, it would be worth climbing up the stairs on your knees to see it... which you can do, actually.The Oratory has a commanding view of Montreal, a beautiful secluded path that guides you through the Stations of the Cross, and a well-manicured series of gardens. ¬†Even if you are not there to appreciate it on a religious level, you'll find something aesthetically moving.The interior is not nearly as impressive as the external architecture, with grand, flat walls instead of the ornately carved ones you may find in a similar cathedral in France or Italy. ¬†Still, the sheer size of the place when you're under the dome is enough to give you the kind of goosebumps you'd expect.Regardless of the length of your stay in the city, find a way to get to the Oratory, particularly if you're a religious type."
"My vacation pictures can be categorized into three categories: - Pictures of Fountains- Pictures of Statues- Pictures of ChurchesIts almost a Pavlovic response when I'm in a foreign city and I see one of the above (I automatically take my camera out and snap, another one for my collection). ¬†St Joseph's is not a well known attraction in Montreal, but it should be. ¬†It reminded me of Sacre Coeur in Paris - its a large domed church on a hill with a nice view. ¬†Parking is $5 and admission inside the church is free (as it should be). ¬†Admission to the church museum is $4, but it did not seem interesting. ¬†There are a lot of places to explore and take great pictures (inside the church, garden, view from the top, view from the bottom, etc). ¬†If you look carefully on the premises, you can find my vacation picture trifecta: church, statute, and fountain."
"Grand cathedral way up a high perch on Mont Royale. ¬†Being Canada's largest church, I guess I was expecting something a bit more ornate inside. ¬†Completed in 1967, it's a modern basilica and it completely feels that way. ¬†The exterior is impressive. ¬†The inside completely has a modern feel to it. ¬†Getting to this landmark isn't easy either. ¬†It's far from downtown by metro or bus. ¬†You can take the 165, 166 or the 51. ¬†By metro you take the blue line to C√¥te des Neiges. ¬†Once in front if the cathedral, you'll panic once you see how high up it is. ¬†Don't worry, there's a shuttle that'll take you up to the entrance. ¬†Once inside, there are escalators and elevators so it's well equipped for all persons. ¬†The shrine of St. Joseph is awesome. ¬†The prayer candles light up the room and they're absolutely my favorite part of the cathedral. ¬†Then there's the Votive Chapel, Tomb of St. Brother Andr√©, Crypt church and the basilica. ¬†Again, it's modern but still very beautiful. ¬†Once outside, there are the gardens but since it's on top of a huge hill, it's very steep. ¬†Admission is free unless you're doing a guided tour which is only $5. ¬†This is definitely worth a stop over when in Montreal."
"A completely different experience from Notre-Dame in the old section of the city near the port, but also a must-see destination in Montreal.This church was inspired by now sainted Andre Bessette who was a poor and not well-educated humble French-Canadian priest who devoted his life to helping the poor and the ill. ¬†Many came to see him to be cured of their ailments. ¬†Bessette started his work from a small wooden chapel, which is still there, and donations came in which allowed the Oratory to be built.The Oratory is in Cote-des-Neiges, slightly northwest of Centre-Ville, and it essentially shares the mountain in the middle of the city with Parc Mont-Royal. ¬†It is an imposing structure, atop a big flight of stairs. ¬†However, the parking (no longer free, so no Oratory visit last time) also climbs up to the sides of the complex and there are ways to get into the complex at grade, without stairs. ¬†Its cupola is reportedly the 3rd largest umbrella dome in the world, and maybe the largest cupola in Canada. ¬†The place holds some kind of record in Canada. The interior of the main church is solemn and the simple geometric beveling inside indicates an art deco style (not as in Miami Beach, but just art deco). ¬†The main church is extremely tall, somewhat plain, and very quiet. ¬†For a more intimate experience, the crypt church below is where most Masses are celebrated and it's a lot less ominous because of the much lower ceiling. ¬†Masses are held in, at the very least, French and English. ¬†There are some interesting things here, such as the huge staircase of candles in one of the wings, the museum, and the models of the church.As for the non-religious aspects, there are incredible views from the various terraces of the church. ¬†Mind you, the mountain blocks the view toward the city, but one can look at the northern half of Montreal and all its northern suburbs beyond. ¬†From up there, everything seems very quiet and still. ¬†Generally, I don't like church gift shops, but this one is airy and has a lot of good tourist and/or religious articles you might buy. ¬†There is also a cafeteria on site and, thankfully, it is very low-key and informal. ¬†In general, the feeling here is very peaceful, so it's a shame they started charging for parking because a visit to the Oratory while in Montreal was always calming."
"St. Joseph's Oratory is quite a sight to see in person. It's massive and spectacular. The best place I truly enjoy here is the hallway with lit candles. The many crutches hanging on both sides of this hallway has some significant meaning, The views of Montreal from the upper levels is amazing and a great photo opportunity.The downside of this place is that over the years with so much popularity, it has become more commercialized and seem to capitalize on visitors for money. But this is a religious free location and everyone is welcome to visit."
"Beautiful catholic building with amazing views. I've seen it a handful of times in the past when younger, but this visit I finally discovered the escalator and elevator. The votive chapel was solemn and we got holy water from the visitor's center. Purchased some items from the gift shop that were nice and I've never seen before."
"St. Joseph's is a massive, gorgeous church. Aesthetically beautiful and a must-go tourist spot. Climb the bazillion stairs if you dare but you won't be sorry. Views from the top are exquisite. Also, definitely make sure you tour through the Garden of the Stations of the Cross. Breathtaking even for nonreligious heathens like me. Definitely go inside and tour the basilica too if you can. Lovely and what a sight to see!"
"This is only a three star for me. I'm not religious, so I didn't have the spiritual connection that some of the other visitors might of had. Also, this felt like a smaller version of the Basilica of the Sacr√© C≈ìur in Montmartre, Paris.With that being said, this basilica offers a fantastic view of Montreal. Definitely take a gander at Brother Andre's heart that is on display. I think that was the first time I've seen a human heart D:"
"You can spot this monument from miles away when you drive into MontrealYet, it remained elusive for me, and I got there late in the afternoon, my journey there was longer than required, I should have taken a train to Station Cote-des-neiges. but ended up walking 1/2 an hour more than I needed toWhen I got there, the view of the Oratory was amazing from up close as much as it loomed over the skyline driving into the city"
"Fantastic view of Montreal from St Joseph's...make sure you climb up to the terraces and explore the huge church. ¬†I'm not religious so I mostly visit churches for historical or architectural curiosity, and this church falls into that category. ¬†The area with all the canes and crutches (from those who had visited and were healed) is a bit awe inspiring. ¬†This church is a little farther from all the touristy parts of Montreal, but it's just a couple blocks away from the subway so it's convenient to get to."
"AMAZING! Free attraction you MUST see, No matter the religion! Gorgeous views from the top floors. Make sure you walk through the gardens. It is breathtaking."
"Perhaps it should be called St. Andre's Oratorio now that he has been canonized but I'm sure he would be too humble to want this. ¬†While not especially old, there is a lot to see at this religious site. ¬†In general, I find the interior of the main church actually is the least interesting part - it is beautiful but quite plain. ¬†If you go, take in the other portions, or do so on several visits. ¬† These include the charming little chapel that Brother Andre originally set up; a museum of religious art (changing exhibits), a crypt church which was obviously completed before the main one and has more traditional stained glass; a hauntingly beautiful hall of votive candles; a way of the cross; a grotto and a carillon. ¬†On top of everything, the view is spectacular.While I am an atheist I did find this to be a very impressive place. ¬†I would withhold five stars simply because I do believe that as far as Catholic churches in North America go, I'd rank both the basilica of St. Anne-de-Beaupre and the Cathedral of St. Louis (in St. Louis, MO) as just a bit more impressive from an artistic standpoint."
One more star than I gave Notre Dame Basilica because I felt like this place was much more impressive. It's HUGE and you have a lot of freedom to explore and look at everything. The pilgrims going up the steps on their knees is something I've never seen before. Definitely worth a trip out to see if you're visiting Montreal.
"Ahhh...what an amazing view of the city. ¬†I am in montreal a lot for work but only got to see this site at night...but still, what an amazing view of montreal. ¬†Definitely a must in the summer, day or night.Can't wait to see the oratory too :)It has become one of my favourite current, and must do visit to montreal :)Ryan"
"Recently on a pleasant April Saturday,I visited the Oratory of Saint Joseph.This holy site was originally built in 1904 under the auspices of Brother Andre,but ¬†completed many years later.This house of worship has magnificent exterior and interior architecture.On the premises,there is a small museum featuring devotional theme art.I appreciated the fine dioramas there by Joseph Guardo,a 20th Century.artist.I also saw at the small devotional theme art museum a fine Tenebrist painting by Belgian Master,Pieter Van Schendel and a ¬†more recent fine artistic creation made of aluminum by Lucy Blanchette(""Oratory of Saint Joseph"").For those of us without cars,the Cotes Des Neiges Metro Station is very close to this holy site."
"This was the first place I visited while in Montreal. ¬†I didn't grow up Catholic or attend a church with a giant building so every time I visit churches like these, I'm at least a little amazed. ¬†We did a lot of random exploring throughout the church. ¬†I'm not going into detail about each place that we went to, but I think it's definitely worth exploring the entire building. ¬†As I've been looking at attractions in Montreal, this definitely should be a lot higher on the list. The view of the city from here is absolutely beautiful especially at sunset. ¬†For any visitor to Montreal, I definitely think this place is worth the visit."
"Calm, serene, quiet, beautiful. Lots of steps which can be challenging in winter (my wife and I went on a day that it was below zero outside following the largest snowfall in MTL in around 40 years) but it was well, well worth it."
"Hailing from a strict catholic background, I've seen my fair share of grande churches. I clearly had an expectation upon the drive to St. Joseph's Oratory. Let me say that I was indeed impressed by what stood before me. It is a magnificent work of architecture only minds ahead of their time dream up. ¬†There are many ins and outs, floors, rooms and grottos located within its majestic walls. ¬†Masses, concerts and prayer celebrations are held here as well. ¬†It also houses the tomb and heart (literally) of Brother Andre. In their candlelit quarters, you come upon the Stations of the Cross. From the upper levels you can catch an awe inspiring view of Montreal. You realize this is a truly beautiful city sparked by so much history.I could think of adjectives all day to expound on how magnificent the Oratory is, inside and outside of its great walls, but I think you catch my drift..."
"What an absolutely beautiful and gigantic place! St. Joseph's Oratory is a gorgeous church that's built upon Mount Royal and is Canada's largest church. It basically has three sections. The first section (the one closest to ground level) is a very simple church, though it's quite long. There is a very nice section off to the left of the church where there are large areas of candles for offerings. The second level of the church houses a museum (which requires a fee) and a nice (free) section dedicated to (Saint) Brother Andre. The top level is the basilica, and it's the most massive church I have ever been in; you truly can't appreciate the size until you walk through it. From the top level, you can walk outside and visit the small chapel of Brother Andre as well.The church is very peaceful and the view from the top of the church, looking over all of Montreal, is quite amazing. It's definitely a place you have to visit while you're in Montreal, whether you're religious or not."
"Really enjoyed this venue. ¬†It is a large and spectacular basilica. ¬†Enjoyed it more than Notre Dame in the old Montreal. ¬†They have a great garden to walk through and they only request $5 for parking as opposed to charging entry per person like Notre Dame. ¬†The view here is also spectacular and honestly, we are so over the gaudy gold alters of other churches. ¬†This is more humble and has its own qualities. ¬†There is also a separate chapel that Frere Andre built next to the large basilica to see and when we went, it wasn't crowded at all. ¬†Very much worth the trip."
"This is a huge church. ¬†I'm told it's the biggest Catholic church in North America. ¬†We stopped by just for a visit and walked around. ¬†It's humongosaur. ¬†Definitely not as fancy and elaborate as all the churches I've seen in Europe, but it's definitely one of the biggest. ¬†There are a ton of stairs to climb up, which we bypassed because we drove up to the top. Up the stairs inside the church they have Brother Andre's heart housed in a glass case across from scenes of St. Joseph's life."
"Surely one of the largest and most spectacular religious structures in North America. Situated atop Mont Royal, it boasts a gorgeous view. Fascinating stories about Brother Andre (now canonized) -- I wonder what he'd think of his tiny chapel now. ¬† It's a stunningly contemporary design inside, and the organ is amazing. The votive chapel is lovely, and directly behind it is Brother Andre's tomb (his heart's located elsewhere in the building) and a glimpse at the part of Mont Royal the oratiry was built into. The lame crawl up the stairs to the oratory, and the crutches and canes displayed in the votive chapel attest to the faith of those visitors."
"The Oratoire Saint Joseph is quite a landmark, as it can be seen from incredibly far away across Montreal. But Getting up there can be a hassle if you're a pedestrian, and once you do make it up, the chapel inside is very lean. There is nothing to see. No art, no decorations, nothing at all except high white walls and dark wooden seats. I'm sure they're impressive in their own way, but being European I must admit that after having done the climb once, I was massively disappointed! They do have a very popular Christmas service, but I haven't been to it as I am not Catholic. On the other hand, the view from above the observatory is delightful, and a place I would definitely go visit again. To get there you need a car and a very good knowledge of the back streets of the Mount Royal, but it's definitely worth it."
"A wonderful place to visit. The grounds are lovely and there's a great view from the church. We didn't find the steps to be bad, but we are in good physical shape. Free to visit. The inside of the church is beautiful and quite different from some of the other notable churches in Montreal (such as Basilique Notre Dame). There is also a lovely stations of the cross garden that is worth seeing as well. We had a great visit and I would highly recommend visiting."
"Several years ago I visited the Oratory. ¬†I heard mass in the crypt church, lit a candle among thousands in the hallway, enjoyed the mural to St. Joseph patron of Canada, visited the different exhibits (including the nativity scenes and miraculous sites in Quebec). ¬†I also purchased holy oil from the store, and, enjoyed lunch in the cafeteria, ¬†I loved the view of Montreal. ¬†I was overwhelmed by the large sanctuary. ¬†I was thrilled to hear that Brother Andre had been canonized. ¬†This is a place every person should see, religious or not. ¬†They will benefit in some way.Gail OsburnWashington, D.C."
"Let me start off by saying I'm a former militant Catholic (Bible-carrying, judging other people, celibate, thinking I'm better than others, the whole nine yards) and a current bitter, cynical atheist (being an asshole, judging other people, thinking I'm better than others, being celibate but not on purpose, the whole nine yards). ¬†Reading the other reviews, I can see that most people have a religious or non-religious bias, which is understandable. ¬†I'm here to tell you that I've been to both sides, and as biased as it's going to be anyway, I will tell you about this place straight up for what it is.First off, this is one of the most underrated tourist attractions in Montreal. ¬†I don't know why the hell people don't flock to this place like crazy. ¬†When you first see it, the utter immensity of it hits you straight in the skull. ¬†The sheer manpower it took to construct this beautiful piece of art is just jaw-dropping. ¬†The first time I went I actually had to pick up my jaw off the floor. ¬†OFF THE FLOOR. ¬†It took 12 hours to surgically re-attach it at the Jewish General Hospital afterwards. ¬†THAT'S HOW HUGE AND POWERFUL IT IS.All joking aside, this place will have an impact on you. ¬†I've been to it over 50 times. ¬†This is not an exaggeration. ¬†Go on a Sunday morning, when pilgrims from many different countries (as well as from here) go up the steps on their knees, praying at each step. ¬†Whether or not you are Catholic or believe in God, you can witness the power of religion and its positive effect on people here. ¬†You will see a beautiful view of the northern part of the city from the top. ¬†Inside you will see beautiful architecture and can get a tour of the grounds and insides. ¬†There's a small little ""tunnel"" in the back where the ventilation vents out, and it smells like Bibles. ¬†Go ahead and check it out. ¬†You'll know exactly what I mean.It's interesting to see the old church Saint Andre built before the Oratory was constructed as well. ¬†Although St-Joseph's Oratory is closed at night, you can walk around and/or go up the stairs for a mind-blowing view at anytime. ¬†I would, in fact, recommend doing that at least once. ¬†It is one peaceful place."
"Please let me preface with saying that St. Joseph is one of my favorite saints, the other being St. Michael the Archangel. That being said, the Oratory was my Disneyland! My boyfriend-now-husband Floyd surprised me by planning a visit up here from Boston, where we both lived at the time. We're both very active Catholics and spent hours exploring the Oratory. I've visited many basilicas in Italy and of course the Oratory doesn't compare, but it is still a very special place for me.One of the first things we noticed was the four flights of stairs and three pedestrian crosswalks in between each set leading to the Oratory, which I believe is the highest point in Montreal and the second largest dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The middle set of wooden stairs was reserved for pilgrims climbing up on their knees. We both looked forward to attempting the stair climb at the end of our visit.After the Way of the Cross in the garden (Floyd made me pose and take photos next to each station, saying ""It's like each station is a prize on Wheel of Fortune...""), the multiple chapels, and other sites within and around the Oratory, hours passed and Floyd wanted to climb the stairs before sunset. He insisted I stay at the top to take pictures of him, with the excuse that I was in a dress and would hurt my knees. I agreed and Floyd made his way down. As he climbed up, I noticed Floyd clasping his hands, and I assumed it was in act of reverence and prayer. Tourists started staring as he neared the top, and with Floyd beginning to struggle in the heat, I encouraged him to climb the last set of stairs. Upon the last step, after my congratulatory remarks, Floyd urged me to come close. We embraced and Floyd whispered plenty of sweet nothings, including that he would try his best to ""be your St. Joseph, and there'd be nothing more lovely than to have you as my Mother Mary."" He exposed the ring he held in his hands the way up the stairs, asked me for my hand in marriage, and naturally, I beamed and exclaimed, ""Yes!"" We rushed back in, just in time to have one of the priests bless my engagement ring before he left for the day and light a few candles, especially the one for St. Joseph, Head of the Holy Family. It was the most beautiful, fitting proposal, and I will always fondly remember the Oratory as the place we got engaged. I definitely would love to visit again for one of our future anniversaries. Even if I hadn't gotten engaged here, this place is a must-visit for both Catholics and non-Catholics who can appreciate such beauty."
Hands down of my favourite places in Montreal! I attend mass over here! The building is huge! Great view as well! Its definitely a must!
"I really have a hard time believing I am the first to review this. This was an exceptional place to visit. Built in the 1960s, it's a shrine dedicated to Jesus' father, Saint Joseph, by the Brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. ¬†It seems one of the monks, Brother Andre (who dreamed of this place) also was known for his curative miracles and people from all over Canada and the world make the pilgrimage here yearly. ¬†It's got four chapels and the basilica (chapels is a loose term-the largest holds upwards of 1000 people) all of which are available for self-guided tour. ¬†There is also the tomb of Brother Andre, a permanent exhibit dedicated to his life, a museum on the history of the holy family, and (seasonally) the shrine gardens for viewing. ¬†The museum is known for its' permanent exhibit of nativity creches from around the world. Guided tours are given and probably the best way to see most of the Oratory quickly, but you can do just a well picking up a brochure at the visitor's center and taking the complex at your own pace. Personally, I think most impressive features are the Crypt Church with its' stained glass windows, the 300 steps (or 99 kneeling steps for pilgrims) to the basilica, and the Votive Chapel where previous grantees of Brother Andre's miracles left their crutches and canes. ¬†Although not impressive at all (as it should be), the chapel of Brother Andre is the original site of his miracles and is located away from the grandeur of the basilica. A word of caution, the Oratory, being built in the mid-1900s, is modern and doesn't have quite the ornamentation of older pre-1900 churches, but nonetheless, it is just as impressive. ¬†It also features a carillon (bell tower) that gives performances most days of the week and a world renown Boys' Choir (Petits Chanteurs du Mont-Royal) which tours internationally in the summer. ¬†I think they are almost as good as Vienna's Boys' Choir.The shrine does have a touristy side with a gift shop and cafe, but at least the Oratory hasn't started charging admission, although they do ask for a donation to view the museum. ¬†There also is a small hostel for pilgrims to the shrine who will be staying overnight. ¬†I did the entire thing in several hours, but you can probably get through it in a hour or less if you want to. ¬†Being a shrine of medical miracles, the place is definitely wheelchair accessible, but to walk the Oratory is a bit of hike. ¬†The basilica sits on the western part of Parc du Mont-Royal and the dome can be seen all over Montreal (I think it's actually the highest point in Montreal.) ¬†The closest Metro stop is Cote des Neiges, but it still a long walk from the Metro station. ¬†I suspect you can catch a bus from the Metro station though. ¬†Also check the website for additional information such as open times.It's a must see in my opinion that definitely doesn't break the bank (READ: Free!)"
"We tried to visit the oratory in August, 2013. We were a group of six elderly Americans eagerly climbing the hill to visit the church that we had read had no entrance fee. A very mean lady stopped us and told us we would have to pay the fee for guided tour groups. When we told her we were just a group of tourists she threatened to call security and rudely insisted that we leave immediately. This was a terrible experience for us. Had we walked in alone or by twos we would have walked right in to visit what we read is a beautiful structure!"
"I would put 4-5 stars if I was religious. From a esthetic point of view, all tourist will visit at the very least one Catholic Church. I'd suggest this one if you want to see an amazingly huge church. Last time I went, we climbed the stair like lot of curious people wanting to push theirselve to the maximum. There's about 200-300 stairs easy. for Elder/ Disable / Inactive people not so interested by it, there's an Elevetor from the very bottom. There's also in Christmas time some nice Cr√®che (In English? Nativity Scene... I dunno) ¬†expositions. There's som guided Tour or simply follow your instinct and walk all over the place. There's some Choir for pretty much every Mess and ¬†it's one of the best panorama you'll have from Montreal. It's not really the same view as ¬†Plateau Mont-Royal. I'd also suggest tourist to discover Cote-Des-Neiges area. Over 100 different cultural community, lot of nice little market/store. Just 10 minutes walk from Cimetary Cote-des-Neige the most beautiful Cimetary, worth visiting for the nice walk after Saint-Joseph Oratory."
"St. Jospeh's Oratory stands atop of Mount Royal. It's an impressive Catholic ¬†church and an imposing basilica with an imposing sea green dome top. There are many steps to get up to the top, but once you do, you'll have an impressive view of Montreal."
"The botanical garden is just a beautiful sight to see, the flowers are all more impressive than the others and the colours are definitely mesmerizing. I recommend going there on a sunny day, so you can really capture the beauty of it. It takes about 1-3 hours to walk around and appreciate the different gardens but it's definitely worth every penny!!Don't forget to go inside as well, the plants are also impressive"
"Um, in a time when I can't travel---the memories of being here in January lift me up so, so much! I spent a few hours at the Botanical Gardens in Montreal and so enjoyed it! My favorite was seeing all the coffee trees (I'm obv a coffee fanatic) and the tropical fruit trees. Also for things like mandarin/banana trees, it was so tempting to take some of that fresh picked fruit, but obviously I had to be a good samaritan and not touch it as the signs indicated. All in all - my experience at the botanical gardens was amaaazing and I think it should definitely be on your list of places to visit when in Montreal!"
"What a breathtakingly beautiful place with all types of colorful blooming flowers, green grassy areas, blue bodies of water and more! My favorite gardens were Chinese Garden, Rose Garden, and Flowery Brook. Upon entering, you are privy to Reception Gardens which are tall trees, flowers and a walkway leading to a fountain and the stately, impressive library on the grounds. My friends and I then started off going through the greenhouse exhibition grounds, which was my least favorite portion because I'm not really a fan of greenhouses. Most of it was warm, tropical with cactuses and green plants. I did like the orchids, bridge, and pond though. We continued on to the Rose Garden and Aquatic Garden. Roses are my favorite flowers, so I enjoyed this garden immensely. There were pinkish-yellow, red, orange, pale pink, purple, yellow-colored roses, as well as a pretty arch and statue of a joyful young girl. The Aquatic Garden were different pools of water with little fountains. It was very calming and refreshing to walk through it. Next was the Chinese Garden which was incredibly impressive! The entrance was through a foresty bunch of trees with red and gold lanterns hanging up above. There was also a red and black pagoda and inside the pavilion, crystal blue clear water with lantern art of fishermen and boats, orange and blue fishes, a huge bird, etc. All of this is surrounded by lush green grass, lilacs, pandas and bamboo lantern art display, rocks, Chinese style buildings, and a natural-looking waterfall on a rocky cliff. After that, we checked out the Japanese Garden which was not all that compared to what I just experienced in the Chinese Garden. There was a bonsai display, lantern art of cranes in the grass and a small cultural center. Then there was the Shrub Garden and Alpine Garden. The Shrub one was a little boring for me, but the Alpine Garden had this wild, unbridled beauty with all the rocks, bodies of water and different types of trees. We also saw the Lilacs and Flowery Brook, which boasted all kinds of flowers of red, pink, purple, white, orange, along with leaves of purple, yellow, green and more. It was truly a sight to behold and there was a large body of water with lily pads and marsh-like atmosphere.There were arboretum trails that we did not get a chance to check out, but I was very happy with what we experienced."
"As of August 2019, the Biodome and Insectarium are closed for renovation. I believe the insectarium is supposed to re-open in August 2020. That being said, they don't really have any other exhibits if that's what you're interested in. They have different garden areas for different groups of flowers/plants (i.e. roses, lilacs). My favorite was probably the poisonous plants because it was interesting to read about them. Although they're not really blocked off so if you're bringing children there, you should probably keep an eye on them. I saw one little girl wandering into the bushes as the mom just looked on. Questionable, but not my place to say anything. Anyway, there's also a Japanese and a Chinese garden which were a bit lame.Overall, I'm not sure it was worth the price for what we saw. The price for an adult is $20.50. If you have a student ID, it's $15. I believe they have a parking lot for $12, but we were able to find street parking nearby. Just be mindful of the street cleaning/rush hour signs and you should be fine.Tip - allot yourself at least 2.5 to 3 hours to see everything. The park is huge, and that was already with us skipping some gardens. They have a golf cart that can take you across the park, with several stops - but it doesn't come very often and it's usually packed."
"Montr√©al's Botanical Garden is not something to be taken lightly. I recommend that you come here earlier in the day because it takes several hours to complete the entire garden. I think it took us about 3 and a half hours before we exited on the opposite side. For $20 a ticket, you definitely get your money's worth here. They have a nice handful of little gardens which are very pleasant to the eye. Our absolute favorite was the Chinese garden that is pictured in my review. It really was a beauty seeing all the dragons and pagodas and boats in this section. We spent a good amount of time here taking pictures of everything we could. If you start off from the side by the Olympic Stadium and Science Center, the garden will become less and less vibrant as you go on until you finally exit on Sherbrooke. If you start the either way, all the good stuff will be towards the end. I would definitely recommend that any tourist make a trip here!"
"Not the most breathtaking botanic garden that I've ever been to, but a nice visit in good weather nonetheless. We were one of the last ones to leave, around 8pm. Bring your student IDs for the discount.The assortment of greenhouse/hothouse plants was typical, nothing extraordinary.Sheep grazing the open pastures (part of the garden that had the trails) was a surprising sight!The best part was the Chinese garden: it was the most picturesque part of our experience. Take tons of photos! Really brings you to a serene, meditative place as you appreciate the beauty of nature around you."
"Photos by me.I went with two tweens and two males over 30.So the four of them made my visit unpleasant. And they were ready to go after the golf carted tour. Maybe 1.5 hours. I was so upset I left them to mill around the entrance and walked the ground by myself. Many of the attractions were still under construction and closed to the public. That combined with the fact that I had left four restless people made me marathon visit the gardens and wrap it up..... so: Information from Tripadvisor.com: Along with the Biodome, the Insectarium and the Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium, the Botanical Garden is part of the Montreal Space for Life, Canada's largest natural museum science complex and Montreal's top must see attraction.The Montreal Botanical Garden, one of the city's jewels, is recognized as one of the world's greatest botanical gardens. It offers a colourful program of events, exhibitions and activities all year long. With its collection of 22,000 plant species and cultivars, 10 exhibition greenhouses, Frederic Back Tree House, and more than 20 thematic gardens spread out over 75 hectares, it's also a perfect place to enjoy fresh air and natural beauty. Located just minutes from downtown Montreal, right near the Biodome and Olympic Park, the Montreal Botanical Garden is a living museum of plants from all over the world. You can also enjoy the Insectarium which is on the Garden's site."
"I hadn't been to the botanical gardens since I had gone for a field trip many years ago with elementary school. I finally went back recently for the garden of light and it was quite beautiful. 16$ entry fee and definitely book your tickets for your timeslot in advance (online) if you're planning to go on the weekend , also keep an eye on the weather as it's all outside , it likely won't be as enjoyable in the cold or in the rain. The Chinese garden was very pretty , you almost feel like you're no longer in montreal. Definitely worth checking this out , I would curious to see some of their other exhibits. They do special ones for Halloween and various other holidays/themes. family friendly but also a nice idea for a date :)"
"I am a HUGE fan of botanical gardens so this was a must for our trip to Montreal.We spent quite a few hours here and probably would have spent more if it hadn't been such a hot day.The gardens are beautiful! I'll say it again for those in the back - Beautiful!There are lots of different sections - a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, a shady garden, shrubs, beautiful flowers, goes on and on.There are also little ponds and lakes here and there, adding to the overall beauty of this place.If botanical gardens are your thing then you have to come here and plan on being here a few hours at least.Loved it and I'd love to go back!"
"I came here with my sister and we were impressed at the variety in flowers and plants there were! It was very easy to follow the map I was provided with. However, I was upset that the insecatrium was closed until 2021! I was really looking forward to visiting that area of the garden."
"I actually was going to not visit this place during my time in Montreal. I'm really glad that I managed to stop by in my last day because this was absolutely beautiful. I'm pretty convinced that their prettiest views are in the beginning of the garden -- the lovely flower gardens, Japanese garden, and the cacti area. This botanical garden is huge. In addition to the three main attractions that I loved, there were so much more to explore. Although subjectively not as pretty, it was a good leisure walk through all the nature. Also, they sell your typical vanilla ice cream by the front of the gardens if you're craving a little treat."
"Jardin Botanique is an excellent botanical gardens and absolutely beautiful with many thematic garden areas. If you're coming from downtown Montreal, take the green metro line toward Honor√©-Beaugrand and get off at the Pie-IX station. Upon exiting the station, go straight down Boulevard PIe-IX (R) up about a quarter mile to the entry of the gardens. ¬†If you take a counter-clockwise route through the themed gardens, you will be able to experience first the Rose Garden, followed by the Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, Aquatic Garden, Shade Garden, Lesley Hancock Garden, Shrub Garden, Toxic plants, Medicinal plants, Quebec Corner, Monastery Garden, and many others. ¬†There is also a nice gift shop at the exit point. We spent about three hours in duration and it was very relaxing, breezy, great weather and an all-around great experience. The garden is very well kept and very clean."
"Food: N/AService: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor & Style: 4/5The Japanese/Asian architecture were amazing. Most of it was actually authentic; they had to break it down from the Orient, bring it to Montreal and re-build it! Are you kidding me?! Worth seeing if you are in Montreal for a few days. In terms of the gardens were were slightly disappointed because we thought we would be seeing the Sculptures that you see all over Yelp, Google, and the internet. However, the as the staff member told us, the sculptures are a competition event and they travel the world so therefore it is unknown when (if ever) they will return to the Montreal Gardens. Overall we had a good time here and the bug museum was interesting!"
"Updating because after 20+ years of living in Montr√©al I finally went to the Butterflies Go Free exhibit at the Botanical Gardens. Honestly even crowded with annoying people and squawking teens this is totally magic and you should go. Try to go on a weekday morning if you can.You wander through desert cacti, spectacular ferns, ¬†beautiful bonsai, and the warmth and smells just make the snowy melting grey outside go away. At the end of the wing you get to a greenhouse full of delicious smelling, butterfly-friendly flowers and the beautiful fluttering delicate otherworldly creatures are everywhere. It's magic. Definitely go."
"I have been to many botanical gardens, in multiple countries. And this is probably the most diverse, largest, and exciting gardens I have been to. There's so much variety in their gardens... From tree gardens to shade gardens to Chinese and Japanese gardens and children's gardens... It was all very beautiful. There are also lots of places to sit.... Including hammocks!! Which who doesn't like a hammock?!?! Also... There are sheep! Sheep! In the garden! Also... There are two separate entrances. So keep that in mind when you are looking for parking."
"This place is super cool. If you're looking for a way to spend an entire day in Montreal, you can walk around the gardens for hours. Plus, you can go to the other attractions in the Olympic venue. They even offer ice cream with chocolate covered ants on it. I think the picture speaks for itself (this might be the best picture I've ever taken). Disclaimer: I am not a photographer so if it's not good let me think it is"
"I'm normally not one for botanical gardens or botany, but these expansive, beautiful and lush gardens left me in awe and smiling. ¬†The acres and upon acres of greenery and unique flora and choreographed landscapes are all well put together I hadn't planned on spending more than an hour here, but actually spent close to 2 hours and would've stayed longer had I more time. ¬†Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk. No mosquitoes. ¬†The on site cafe has creative and healthy food for reasonable prices. ¬† Words can't really describe this place, so go look at the photos!$20 for adults, $10 for kids, but I had a 72 hours Montreal Passeport($99) which covered entry. ¬†Worth it either way!"
The highlight of our recent visit to Montreal. Especially appreciated how all of the gardens were split up into different types and geographic areas around the world. Learned so much and experienced much beauty.Be sure to budget a full day for this wonderful place.
"While I visited Montreal, I discovered the Magic of the Lanterns and I loved it. I enjoyed Chinese fishing traditions and tales through colorful and magical lanterns. This interactive event will please both adults and children. The ticket also includes the botanical garden and the Insectarium. ¬†A must see!Discover more on my personal blog (daydreamunderthestars.co‚Ä¶)."
"Unfortunately I can't say that this was the best botanical garden I've been to. The Bloedel Conservatory in Vancouver still takes the top spot for me.I was fully aware that the Chinese gardens were closed for renovations (they warn you of this before you buy your ticket), but what they should really warn you is that the Garden Sculptures are no longer there, unlike what the pictures proliferating on Pinterest tell you.The remaining gardens were on the lackluster side for me, and the map was a bit confusing but I guess breathing in some fresh air is a positive either way. The Insectarium was a fun side trip inside the gardens. Seeing the leaf-cutter ants haul food back into their nest was a neat treat. My favorite was the Greenhouse, which was actually a long chain of connected greenhouses, taking you through the various climates and displaying the plants that thrive in them.Overall, not the best botanic garden out there, but worth a stop if you have kids or loads of time to kill. ¬†3.75"
"Montreal's secret Garden- an escape from city life - Admission was 16$ with a 4$ discount if you're a local. Fare includes entry into the insectarium. I would recommend buying the tickets online to save the walk to the ticketing booth.There were several gardens to tour including the First Nations, Alpine, Japanese, etc.. Chinese garden is currently under construction. Every park was breathtaking! Zen by the pond and waterfalls. There were benches tucked away in every spot for your reading or relaxing pleasure. There were more shaded trails for those wanting to hide from the sun! The summer 2017 lineup includes live musical performances every Sunday - gets pretty packed as people bring their lawn chairs and picnic mats. Good for the family.A 2 hour tour will usually cover the whole Park!"
The botanical garden is absolutely beautiful! I was upset to miss the tulips but the gardens were really gorgeous and had tons of different areas to check out. As the morning went on the place got busier and more crowded. I'd recommend arriving at opening for a more peaceful experience. I spent almost 3 hours here just wandering around. It's near the Olympic stadium area (about a 10 minute walk) so you can find activities nearby to keep you busy for most of the day. The gift shop has some unique and fun gifts or souvenirs.
"We were on our weeklong trip around Montr√©al and wanted to hit up as many touristy spots as we could. Naturally, we found ourselves here on a Free Day. I feel for the people that paid to enter here; my expectations for this place may have been raised if I had to pay for admission. It's a cool place to take photos, so my friends Rafael and Mehek came prepared with their fancy cameras.For a place with free admission, it was surprisingly thorough and well worth the visit. The greenhouse featured several exquisite plant specimens from all over the world. Outside appeared to be several stands offering their plant goods. Maybe that's why admission was free on that day, in order to support these various businesses. That's just my guess, so don't quote me on that.There was also an insectarium clearly meant for children, with free admission as well. It's a neat place to stop into if you like bugs!Try to get in on a Free Day!"
"Jardin Botanique de Montr√©al is an eye opening attraction of Montreal! Sadly Spring of 2017 when I visit there was a lot of numerous constructions and a few of the parks of the garden was closed.The have a large range of indoor plants and a lot of them are from different parts of the world which was pretty cool. The indoor garden was very clean and there was barely any bugs or flies. There is also a lot of nice bonsai trees.The outside was very nice too, there was random flowers here and there. I was kind of upset that gardens was not open, it would of made my experience so much better. Even though I came in the end of May, there was still lots of cherry blossom trees so it was really nice to take pictures."
"This is a MUST VISIT if you are in Montreal during a nice sunny day. ¬†The garden is HUGE! ¬†They have acres of beautiful plants, trees and lush foilage. ¬†The highlights were the chinese garden which was only partially opened since they are redoing some of the walking paths. ¬†Other attractions at the gardens are the japanese garden and the greenhouse which has like 20+ types of environments from a tropical rain forest to a dry desert with numerous cactus plants. ¬† Make sure you wear some comfy shoes and maybe pack some snacks for a picnic in the lush grounds."
"I think botanical gardens is the best park we have in Montreal. Its huge first of all and its peaceful!! Like most parks this one isn't free (16 $ i believe) which gives you access to the other parts as well. You can buy them online but if the parks empty and you park close you are good to go. I usually bring a blanket to lay down and relax, last time i seen a bunch of baby fox running around and was super close to taking one home ( just kidding but no really they're adorable)they have the lantern festival which is a great way to kick your fall off! They have pumpkins to look at as well if you're in to that and i mean who isnt!"
"When visiting Montreal, this was high on the list of places I wanted to visit, and our family spent most of a day exploring it. ¬†There are several really beautiful areas, while a couple of others were underwhelming. ¬†I think if we had been able to visit during a special exhibition or event, it would have been amazing! ¬†The map also seemed to be incomplete or at least unclear on where a few things were located, so it would be helpful if the map had more complete information. ¬†Overall though, this is definitely worth a visit."
We absolutely loved it here. Between the insectarium and the gardens anticipate like 4+ hrs with lightly walking around the park. Do come with water as others said and sunscreen on hot days.
This is such a beautiful botanical garden in such a pretty city. It's huge. Check out the Lion de la Feuill√©e. Part of the 1976 Olympics were held here.
"I honestly did not want to leave this place. This place is wonderful and probably better than the ones back home. My boyfriend did a wonderful job of picking this place to visit while we were in town. They have a 'butterflies go free"" section and it is very interactive. They have many different zones with many different places and very informative. Also a cute little gift shop just before entering the Botanical. We got the residence of Quebec discount for the 2 o'clock showing for $32 and parking is $12."
"I came to the Botanical Gardens and the Insectarium because I had seen a sign for the butterfly exhibit. Although it was mobbed with rude children and their equally rude parents, it was an afternoon filled with pretty things.I was incredibly sad to see that the staff working here did not protect the butterflies from all the visitors trying to pick them up or touch them. I had a minor confrontation with a gentleman because I saw him scooping up butterflies on several occasions. Aren't people aware that touching them damages their wings which eventually kill them sooner? Given the number of butterflies with ragged wings, I guess not.The green houses are beautiful. I worked really hard not to take a photo every single plant.The Insectarium was something new for me as I've never been to one before. I rather enjoyed looking at all the creepy crawlies. Plus the crowds were more modest."
"The gardens are amazing, the Chinese and Japanese gardens were undergoing renovations (see photos). Lots of beautiful trees, flowers and water fountains. They had many signs with explanations of the flowers and trees. There's a trolley at the exit that will take you around for free. On our way out we decided to jump on and take a ride to the tree house which isn't what you would expect. I thought I was going to see a house in the trees. Nope we arrived at building made of wood with a balcony and just explained about treehouses. Took all of 3mins to explore, the trolley waits 10mins and then takes people back to the exit. It's a one trip stop, I guess you can't expect more for a free ride.If you plan on doing The large tower ride, The Biodome and The Botanical gardens buy the package. The more you do the more you'll dig into your pockets. I believe we paid $35CAD for two sites each."
"Beautiful and expansive botanical garden. There are multiple variations of gardens within the garden and if you take the time to read the signage, you can learn a lot. My favorite sub-gardens were the Toxic Garden and the Japanese Garden. Unfortunate the Chinese Garden is closed for reservations but there was still plenty to see and enjoy.**If you are a student, bring you ID for a discounted rate."
"This is a beautiful garden no matter the time of the year. I was just there and it was stunning even in April. But don't be fooled! The beautiful sculptures that pop up when this garden is searched happened 6 years ago and are no longer there. Still, there is a beautiful Chinese exhibit and the planetarium is close and very fun."
"That's the truth ,about Jardin de boutanque Montreal ¬†you have to go there its quite an friendly experience"
"This is a large and beautiful place to visit in the middle of a busy city. The day we visited it was warmer than usual and we had less time than we would have liked, but it was still a very nice way to spend the day. The food options were great at the restaurant. The portions were large for lunch, and lots of variety. The staff were all friendly even though our French is limited."
"Wish we knew the Chinese garden was still shut down for renovation. It's one of the main exhibits and you can't see much of it unless you're peeking through a fence here and there. they also no longer have the large mossy sculptural exhibits anymore.Like other reviewers said, there aren't clear signs so getting from one part of the garden to the next was a little frustrating.In terms of the flowers, there were some pretty sections, but it was overall underwhelming. The entrance was a little embarrassing. Really sad, sparse looking flower beds. I wouldn't go back."
This botanical garden is so big compare to NY Brooklyn botanical garden. There's a lot to see. Great for educational trip for kids or just exercise/ scenery seeing. The new Chinese garden section is very big and pretty detail with plants and buildings. I enjoy my 2hrs stay there.
"Note: I visited the garden in July of 2016. The Chinese garden was closed and they where doing major renovation. So we heard chainsaw throughout our visit.As a local, I know how superb this place can be. Opulent flowers, gorgeous trees, zen garden everything to feast your eyes on.But I was so disappointed! Only the green houses exhibition where good."
"This is a pretty nice botanical garden. You get to visit the Japanese and Chinese gardens for a single price. The insectarium is also located within the garden and requires another ticket to enter. They are remodeling the Chinese garden so they drained the lake. Bummer. I'm sure with the water in, the garden is stunning. Right now it's land locked."
"Our last visit, a number of years ago, was too late in the season to have enjoyed most of the gardens. ¬†This trip was almost perfect. ¬†I say ""almost"" only because the Chinese gardens were undergoing a major rehabilitation with nothing available to view.But the rest of the entire botanical garden was open and absolutely beautiful in mid June.Your ticket to the gardens also includes access to the Insectarium. ¬†In addition to being an air conditioned and dry space to be valued on a hot or rainy day, it is also educational and very green inside. ¬†Both children and adults will enjoy it."
"This is my third time visiting the botanic gardens here. Because the day was an overcast April afternoon, my wife and I stayed inside and took in the Butterflies Go Free exhibit. Parking was $12. ¬†We spent a couple hours here, and it was definitely worth it. The tropical indoor gardens weren't crowded at all, so we were able to take pictures without needing to wait on others. My wife loved the flowers and the butterfly exhibit because the tropical flowers and plants reminded her of Brazil. The flowers are gorgeous and who doesn't like to see hundreds of butterflies floating through the air in a tropical garden?"
"What we liked best about Jardin Botanique de Montreal is that it was nicely organized by theme or type of plant. My favorites were the edible plants and the Japanese Gardens. I was also a big fan of the houses such as the insect house and a conservatory.The conservatory in particular (and it might actually be called something else) had informative videos and interactive exhibits that taught me about pollution, suffering wildlife species, and the environment. I could have stayed there a lot longer than I did!There were nice paths and plenty of places to relax. I would have preferred better descriptions of the plants or sections. There were only signs with the name of the plants but no additional detail.There were also roads and grassy expanses that seemed incongruous with the rest of the botanical gardens. Something about that seemed incomplete."
"Montreal has several areas with notable attractions with only one of major import being east of Centre-Ville. ¬†That would be the Olympic Village. ¬†The first things that people notice and may want to see are the Inclined Tower and the stadium, nicknamed the ""Big Ow"" for its final price tag. ¬†I've reviewed the Inclined Tower. ¬†Also on the same side of the street and adjacent to the stadium and the tower are the Biodome, a natatorium, and a few other points of interest. ¬†The Biodome is worth visiting at least once. ¬†I've also reviewed it.Because it was across the street and because one is conditioned to usually having a city's botanical garden be free of charge, it took a while longer to finally get over and see it across various trips to this unique city. ¬†It costs somewhere in the $20 CDN range and I believe there was a discount for holders of the AAA/CAA card, as was the case at the Inclined Tower. ¬†Once you get into the Botanical Garden, you really understand how large it is and the care and maintenance that it requires. ¬†And you're glad you went in and paid that tab.  The grounds are laid out according to themes, sometimes with areas of where the plants come from geographically, sometimes as formal gardens, and sometimes according to the season in which they bloom. ¬†About the bloom schedule, this sort of information is available, is sort of consistent across the years, and, if this is a key factor of how to time your visit to Montreal and the Botanical Garden, then you will need to work around that to see the types of plants and flowers you'd like to see. ¬†For most people, I would assume that a visit to Montreal is based on other things, such as autumn color change, summer weather, a music festival, or a sporting event. ¬†Two gardens or exhibits are especially interesting, yet very different from each other. ¬† There is a Japanese pavilion with the more restrained horticulture and art you'd expect to see. ¬†On the other hand, the Chinese exhibit and garden is larger and a lot more elaborate, with a pond, foot bridges, and structures which, to most people, would appear to be authentically Chinese in their inspiration. ¬†There is also an insectarium with (interactive) displays at the Botanical Garden, and it is included with admission. ¬†And, in the middle of it all is a lake with lawns around it.The Botanical Garden can be reached by car, and there is an ample sized parking lot, and it can also be reached by transit, either by the Metro or by bus, both of which stop practically next to it. ¬†It can be visited in conjunction with a visit to the other attractions across the street or by itself. ¬†Of all the attractions in and around the Olympic complex, my nod goes to the Inclined Tower, followed by this - the Botanical Garden - followed by the Biodome. ¬†The Botanical Garden is beautiful but, because of it being different during various parts of the year, will present you with an experience that will please you more ... or less, relative to another visit. ¬†Regardless, I'd be willing to go back and shell out almost $20 CDN at the ""right"" time of year. ¬†I enjoyed it."
"so I came here because there was a picture of this garden where it looked like tafiti from moana but after going through the entire garden, we found out the exhibit had finished (which was upsetting) but overall the garden was absolutely beautiful . there are so many different sections and even a free insectarium that you can honestly spend hours here. my family and I really enjoyed it, there are shuttles that takes you from one end of the garden to the other so make sure you coordinate the timing because otherwise you'll be stuck walking the entire park to get to your car haha. only down side aside from that is that the price of the park is pretty pricey so if you can come with a family to get the family discount or the other discounts that are offered online, do that!"
"I normally wouldn't visit a garden in November, but it was open and I've enjoyed visiting in the past.Unfortunately, many major areas were completely closed, including the entire Japanese Pavilion. Maintenance staff were everywhere, often driving vehicles around and operating loud machinery. Very few flowers were on display.And yet, I was charged the full price of a ticket.Frankly, they have no business charging admission during this time of the year. After buying my tickets, I was dismayed to see that no one was actually at the gate to check tickets; people were just walking in for free. I felt severely ripped off."
"Reviewing this long after a day spent here it's gotta be said if you haven't been here whether you're a local or out of towner you must go here. If you're gardener or have even a slight interest in plant life you must go. There are countless species of plants in the world, I'm certain a large portion of them are here and what's great is so many of the plants and gardens are not native to the region and some not even the continent giving you a chance to to see jungle, desert and mountain Flora and fauna and much more. A day could easily be spent here and you could write a review about it spanning pages. Inside and out there are many exhibits to see and learn about. Out on the grounds there is much to explore too - dozens of flowers, an insect exhibit, even weeds and poisonous plants it's all here. I'd recommend to the old and young, local and foreign. Great experience."
"If you are into botanical gardens, this one is stellar. They say allot 2-3 hours for your visit. I would say 3-4 if you're photographing lots of flowers and plants and want to take the tram through the Arbor."
"TEN STARS. If you enjoy lots of walking and enjoying nature, flowers & animals- we spent the entire day here with family!When it started to rain, we kept dry in the Insectarium...which was absolutely AMAZING.(If you only have a few hours and are in a rush- I don't recommend this place, because there is just too much goodness to soak in. BUT, if you must, go to the Insectarium, the greenhouse and at least the rose garden.)The food at the restaurant, we had soup and sandwiches, was delicious. No complaints whatsoever."
"We decided to visit despite being warned by the hotel concierge that she had gone a week or two before and many of the exhibits were under construction. We got there at about 2:30 PM on a Sunday. Parking is a flat fee of $12. You pay at a multimeter and then place the paid ticket in the dash of your vehicle. There was a fairly short line to get tickets and 3 tellers, but it took forever!!! 2 out of the 3 people that were being tended to were getting tickets for large groups and practically arguing with the garden staff as to their discounts... We finally got our tickets after about 20-25 minutes in line. The ticket person was very nice and accepted my AAA discount. The 1 site rate is $20 CDA for adults and $10 CDA for children. The AAA discount takes off about $1-2. After getting our tickets we started walking through the gardens. The gardens are very big. One thing that seemed to pop up when googling the garden is a few large sculptures, the most notable being a large one with a large head, hand and waterfall. We were later told by staff that that had been taken down a while ago. So mush of the garden seemed to but under construction or incomplete. One thing that saved the trip was the insectarium which is located within the garden grounds and included in the price of the garden admission. It was very informative and interesting. I'm not sure if I could recommend this place in its current condition...maybe after renovations/construction is complete."
"We had the pleasure of visiting earlier this week (mid-June), taking the Metro in, which dropped us only a couple of blocks away. I've been to several botanical gardens and this is one of the best. In particular, ¬†the perennial garden and alpine garden (forest?) were outstanding. In a couple of weeks, ¬†even more plants will be in bloom, ¬†but many were already in color and impressive. Beyond the perennial beds, ¬†when you get near the ponds (water lilies, ¬†etc) there is an area lush with peonies, irises and other beauties and is not to be missed. In two weeks or so, ¬†the roses will all be blooming and should be spectacular. ¬†The onsite restaurant food was surprisingly good and not terribly overpriced. The greenhouses had a wide variety of flowers, ¬†ferns, desert plants and an impressive bonsai exhibit. Great photo opportunities at every turn. ¬†Glad we read several reviews and ignored those who talked about empty beds, etc... Just saw so many wonderful sights here, ¬†we were impressed! Easily, you could spend three or more hours here and not touch all the bases. Bring a camera - we're very pleased with some awesome shots of plants and flowers, and some cool shots of bees in action!"
Really expensive place to see some insect or chinese lanterns . But overall it's really beautiful .
"I think we said ""Oooh, look at that"" maybe once or twice throughout the botanical gardens. This is clearly not a garden meant to cater to all season. We came on July 20th and most flowering plants were either dead dead or just plain wilted. The ground are just okay overall.We were particularly upset that it cost money to park ($12) AND you HAVE to pay ($20) per adult with zero discount offers. We tried to explain to the insectarium ticket people we only wished to walk the garden, but they said you must buy a ticket for the insect museum that is included with park entry. We felt like we wasted our money overall. We spent maybe 10 minutes in the insectarium and 20 minutes in the gardens because it was boring, underwhelming, and just not set up very well to guide you point to point. The park looked nothing like past visitors' photos. I would not recommend this park to any of my friends or family visiting the area in the future unless they like being disappointed and throwing away their money. I have had much better free garden experiences than this one."
"So nicely maintained and thoughtful. We enjoyed strolling through and especially liked the different areas with various themes like the Alpine area and Japanese garden. Perfect activity for the whole family. Huge bonus were the playground for the kids, and ice cream and beer in the same location for a nice break from walking around."
"It is open from 11 AM- 9 PM. Buy a combo tickets for 4 attractions:1. botanical garden, 2. Bio-dome, 3. Insectarium & 4. Planetarium. With this Combo you get 2 times entries to gardens and Insectarium.Reach there by 10:45 AM, else you wont be able to cover all and have difficulties finding parking. Its huge.After buying tickets first go to Biodome, Insectarium in 2 hours then keep 3-4 hours for garden its-self.Food is basic and you will find only one cafeteria in the centre of garden.Be ready to walk a lot , wear best walking shoes. If rain is expected carry raincoats! Only enter from either Gardens side or Insectarium, do not park else where. Do not move towards tree house after gardens as there is 20 mins walk to tree house and in between there is nothing to see. Instead after covering other places drive to backside of garden and in 10 mins you can cover tree house.On the entry they stamp your hand , take care , they check it many times inside :)Carry water with you!Garden are open from April till sept end.Enjoy the beautiful work of art !"
"Honestly, this place is a tourist trap! We only got in the garden for 20 min and it starts raining. We saw the japanese garden which was not all that great. This place is for people that really love trees. Once you pay $20.50 to get in, you can go in and out for the day but not the next day. It would have been nice if we got a refund or an option to come back the next day. Im disapponted and will never go back. We also paid $12 to park and there was no signs or walkway to get to the Garden was easily."
"Before our trip to Montreal, we learned about the Chinese Lantern exhibit in the botanical garden and listed it as a ""Must See"". ¬†Gorgeous handmade lanterns travel from China to Montreal for display in their ""Garden of Lights"". Admission was $15/person but worth every dime and the Metro will dump you within walking distance.We had a difficult time finding the ""Garden of Lights"" within the Botanical Garden because of the French language barrier and probably because some of the Canadians behave like rude French folks. ¬†(Yes I said, ""French"" and ""folks"" in the same phrase). ¬†But once we got our bearings (and Hubby peed behind a tree--it was THAT dark) we were off on an amazing path to loveliness. At one point, we were all lost from each other due to the crowd of people and children in strollers (they should really have an adult only night.) My one criticism is to have lights along the path so you don't trip or step in Hubby's pee."
"Crazy road construction around the garden made it super hard for us to figure out how to get into the park. And once in, we walked all around trying to figure out how to get tickets and our bearings. Had we known there was a dedicated parking lot we would have opted for it but we actually parked in a nearby neighborhood and walked in the pedestrian entrance.But once in, we had a good time. The botanical gardens was very nice, with many sections to see, among tropical fruit trees, ferns, succulents, all in lush settings. The insectarium was small, a bit odd of a building, but our daughter enjoyed it a lot. Behind the insectarium is a good playground. From there, we went to the japanese garden, which was really nice, but the the chinese gardens were shut down for renovations.We didn't use the tram nor did anyone tell us about it when we bought our ticket so we walked everywhere. Even so, we were able to comfortably see all these things in about two hours."
"The Jardin Botanique de Montr√©al is one of my favorite spot in town. It is not very far from the metro (Pie IX) and the purchase of a general admission gives you access to the Insectarium as well. There's not a specific time of the year that I would recommend visiting the Botanical garden, as each season brings a different magical landscape. There are many areas to explore and my kids enjoy it all the time. The greenhouses and different gardens are very well organized and beautiful. It is definitely a must do when visiting Montreal!"
"Botanical garden has exhibition greenhouses; various garden such as Japanese and Chinese gardens; beautiful ponds, water fountains and waterfalls. ¬†Japanese garden is currently under renovation, but tourists and patrons can visit other parts of Japanese garden. ¬†There are 3 (three) entrances and ticket counters; caf√©s and restaurants available throughout the property. ¬†We spent C$39.50 for 2(two) visitors; visited gardens of light which illuminates at night. ¬†Live music & costume dressing for photographs @ Chinese garden. ¬†Great light shows at Japanese gardens. ¬†Bontanical center provides informative and inspiring messages for everyone to respect, conserve and preserve natural resources and the environment."
"The Montreal Botanical Garden is truly a clean, well organized, and beautiful place. ¬†Overly signs are clear, parking is practical(not free) and easy access from the metro station. With a short walking distance. Due to a short spring/summer period that Montreal has, the gardens are not open for long. Yet throughout the year, they will have many beautiful things to see indoors. One setback from all this? The rates! They differer from children to senior, or from Quebec resident to non-residents. Having said this. A family of four with their regular rates, will be spending around $100. Do I think it's worth the high cost? Absolutely! Yet, if you are a family. Do keep in mind that prices at the Botanical Garden do add up, quickly."
"One of the best botanical gardens, really world class. The Japanese and Chinese gardens are two of my favorite spots to visit and there is a shaded walk way through the woods that is just spectacular. If you chance to visit Montreal mid October, you can take in the Chinese lantern festival after dark, the back drop of night, the vivid colors of lanterns and mythical figures is something to behold. It is such a beautiful well maintained Garden with ever changing garden and flower themes, there is always something new mixed in with the standard and familiar. Do not be remiss and overlook the vast resources and splendor of the Jardin Botanique on your visit to Montreal."
"This was on my to do list in Montreal but we were still iffy about it until I saw the lights decoration advertisement nearby our hotel. It's probably more worth it to see the garden with some kinda theme going on rather than seeing the garden itself only. PRICE$19.25 reg$14.25 with student ID$12 Parking- Wear comfortable shoes. There's A LOT of walking going on- Bring water and snacks. They don't check your bag- Get a map before you enterThis is probably one of the biggest botanical garden I've been to. It is huge so I guess for the price you paid, it's worth it to check out. It's probably as big as Huntington Park or even bigger in California but with more stuff to check out. I like how each section has a theme to it so whatever you don't like, you can easily skip through it. It's been awhile but what stood out the most to me was Chinese & Japanese Garden. Maybe we went during the time they had lights decoration so it wasn't as plain. Japanese Garden has this beautiful cranes lit up at night and it was gorgeous. And that's where they offer free wifi too."
"Have been here twice in the winter to visit the indoor gardens. It's a nice, warm, beautiful spot on a cold, winter day. They had a butterfly exhibit the second time there. It was cool, but packed! Hard to navigate. Would love to visit the outdoor gardens in the summer."
"Forget everything that you've known about visiting a botanical garden. The visit alone will change your experience and knowledge of plants and flowers. The ticket price is worth every cent from the beautiful sculptors and displays in addition to the lovely exhibits and attractions that the garden covers. Unfortunately, Hub and I were not able to visit and cover every section of the garden since we did all the attractions on the same day. We skipped the Tree House and Leslie-Hancock Garden and the Youth Gardens that was located all the way at the end of the museum. The botanical garden would take at least 3 hours to cover the entire premise for your visit. For those who need more time to venture and explore, no worries the admission is good for 2 days. Our fav area is definitely the popular Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The layout of the landscape design is literally covered in blooms, pavilion, and waterfalls. In terms of variation, the Chinese garden is known for the architecture and history of the Dynasty while the Japanese garden is known for combining all elements of the garden to create art and zen state of mind. As for the horticulturist-artists work, all of the mosaics were breathtaking. However, the work of the Mother Earth is a stunning and unforgettable creation. I can't even begin to describe the striking visual of the intricate shape of the hands opening up a waterfall and the other hand to a deer. Just by a glance tells you, not only does the sculpture look tedious but it definitely took hours of labor and toll to complete the piece of art. ¬†And, you get to vote on your favorite work/sculpture at the International Hub to win a trip for 2 to Doha, Qatar until the end of this year. ¬†For those who are into the whole garden scenery, the Insectarium might be more of your cup of tea. There are numerous collections and exhibits on the diverse insects. There's even a live demonstration for those brave enough to hold a scorpion. The leafcutter ants are pretty amazing. Each ant picks and cuts leafs to feed and harvest fungus where they feed and maintain their nest and defend their colony. Have fun on your visit. Enjoy!"
"Visited this garden in the winter, snow was all over, the walkways were pretty clean, Highly recommended. Walk the grounds for a breath of fresher air, and a great place for kids to have a good time, I highly recommend it."
"Exceptionally beautiful botanical Garden, probably the bet I've ever been too. Photographers and wannabe photographers will have a great time here as their are endless pictures opportunities."
"Garden of Lights event was beautiful in the Chinese Garden but not as exciting in the other gardens especially at night when not much is visible. The indoor exhibits and greenhouse are great though, many many displays of what each plant is and additional information!"
"As a local resident, I've been to the Botanical gardens dozens of times and I truly recommend visitors of this city to spend a whole day visiting these gardens.Firstly, make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes as this place is HUGE and you'll be walking a lot.There are many other things to watch and view but I'll cover the more important features of this place.If you've read some other reviews, the most famous garden is the Chinese Garden which gets even nicer at night particularly during the Light Festivals in Autumn.The Japanese Gardens are excellent as well. Particularly during a very special week (that changes from year to year depending on climate) during Spring to watch the cherry blossoms trees bloom.The insectarium is very interesting as well though it took a huge step back for me when they no longer had the bee hives exposition. However, the ant exposition is very cool.The price tag can be somewhat expensive, I suggest checking online for coupons/deals to shave off a few dollars. Also, if you have a friend or relative in Quebec, drag them with you, you'll get a significant rebate."
"WARNING:It's VERY cold in Montreal between Oct and Feb. This garden is really big and you will NOT have places to hide from the cold! Dress warmly!!WHEN TO GO:- end of Feb - April = butterflies flying around!!!!!!!! ""Butterflies Go Free / Papillons en libert√©""- Sept - Oct = lunar festival, lights in the Chinese garden ""Gardens of Light / Jardins de Lumin√®re""- Sept - Dec = the ANTS will walk around, FINALLY NOT HIBERNATING (Insectarium)Your ticket to Jardin Bontanique includes Insectarium.It's $20 regular (and $15.50 for QC residents) which covers the costs of keeping the plants and insects so happy and beautiful.The garden is soooooooooooooooo big. If you drank coffee, tough luck!! I drank coffee! I was pretty lost once I went deeper only to realize I was circling!! The map told me to keep going and I did and it doesn't end. Every step just opened up a new area to explore. Until ""Oh it's this. Again. Ok let's turn left this time.""Do note that a lot of trees lose their leafs by fall. Summer is Jardin Botanique's peak season. But I really really want you to know that this garden is beautiful all year round because trees are always beautiful.I love this place!!!! There are many happy squirrels."
"To preface my review, I think your perception of this botanical garden really depends on which season you visit. When I went, in mid-April, it was still quite cold and the garden wasn't even charging admission in the outer exhibits. The feature was pretty much just the insectarium and the butterflies. I mean...the former was kinda good (but very small) and the latter could've been experienced for free at Changi airport in Singapore. Sure, there were a lot of butterflies, but it was kind of overkill. The line to see them was way too long and it was a bit underwhelming. I think it would've been cool to see the Chinese and Japanese gardens but they were unfortunately closed. Eh."
"Absolutely beautiful. If you are visiting Montreal in the summer this is a must see. What a great day we had there even with just the basic pass into the gardens you get to see everything in the gardens and also the insectarium which was pretty wild. Prepare to do a lot of walking unless you take the little electric train around the gardens but you don't really get to enjoy everything while speeding through it on a cart.I was only diappointed that i didnt get to see the shrubs cut into animals and crazy things. When you search this on google these are the first pictures that come up and i was sold on going here because of those! it turns out those are two years old and they dont exist anymore, sad. Nevertheless it was a great expereince."
"Wow! I wish I had more time, energy to have spend longer here. It was pretty amazing. I especially enjoyed the koi fish in the pond and all the beautiful flowers and interesting trees! I definitely need to come back and take a really good long look, hopefully next april when the butterflies are out and about!"
"I was expecting more. The Chinese garden as others mentioned is the high light. We went during the day, not for the light show at night. The first national garden section is kind of awful to look at and is a let down. I was expecting to see manicured and well cared for flowers arranged in beautiful settings and grouped by colors into amazing designs. No. Just some flower groupings with some flower species not doing all that great in early September. The shade garden was in better shape than the flowers that lead into the Chinese garden. Did not have time for the green houses but also was just so over the underwhelming experience and already tired from walking without much reward that we were ready to go. Maybe at night is better?"
My favorite exhibit was the Chinese exhibit. I loved all the lighted displays and the lilly pond and architecture. ¬†The food at the deli was JUST OK.I wished it was more organized. I really wanted to grab a drink at the restaurant but there was an opera going on and there was a long line at 5 PM and they close at 6 PM. ¬†I would recommend bringing water because the walk from the train station or the biodome is uphill and a bit of a walk for a hot summer day. ¬†It was nice to stroll around the park. ¬†There were a few wedding photographer and parties there. ¬†The exits and entries are very confusing.
You could make a whole day out of this which is awesome. Beautiful gardens and I almost died when I got to the Chinese garden. When I walked through the wall I thought I had instantly had been transported to China. Keep note they have different things going on in the teahouse so maybe plan your visit around an event as I missed one I would've enjoyed. We sat down in the teahouse and was shown how to do tea and had cookies with it for $10 and well worth it. Japanese garden had a house full of kimono and impressive bonsai as well as many friendly Koi in the pond. Loved every second here
"If you are a tourist from out of town, the admission comes out to be about $19.00 per person with tax. A ticket gives you access to the Insectarium de Montreal and the train and shuttles that go throughout the garden. Here are some quick tips when coming here for a day trip:- Parking: If you want to park on the premises, it is $12 for the entire day. We are out of towners and didn't want to deal with trying to find street parking. You can park here and walk to the BioDome to save some money.- Gardens: There are a wide variety of gardens to go to. The China Garden, Japanese Garden, and Rose Garden. They even had a Natives Garden which was pretty unique. My only gripe is that the flowers were not exactly in bloom in the month of August. Most of the living things that we saw were plants. Even the rose garden was pretty sparse. Upkeep of the Chinese and Japanese structures were also pretty limited. The Chinese structures had cobwebs and didn't look well maintained.- Asian Friendly: I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I feel that my parents got a really good kick out of the gardens - mainly because they were able to reminisce on good times in Asia when walking through the Chinese gardens. They even have tea where you can sit on the porch of the gardens, drink tea, and chat as you look out into the koi pond area. The signs say not to feed the Koi fishes but the Koi fishes follow you around, which shows me that people do it anyway.- Mini Train: For those who can't walk very far, there is a mini train that takes you on a 15 minute tour of the entire garden area. There is also a free shuttle that takes you to different stops throughout the gardens.Bottom Line: A little expensive and not as well maintained as I thought it would be. It is definitely lower on the list of things to see in Montreal."
"+++Expensive but worth every penny, even with reduced winter/night time accessWiFiChinese Garden at night is a sight to behold++Great family or date fun,Insectarium is insanely creepy but educational and interesting (I was fascinated watching the ant exhibit) and a great way to get a respite from the cold-LONG waiting line, esp in cold weatherReduced winter access, we only were able to do Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, Insectarium...with that said, we still spent about two hours perusingJapanese garden was a disappointmentThey took out the sculpture garden :(TIPS:Buy tickets online if you canThey sell hot tea in the Chinese gardenDress Warm!!!Don't forget your student ID"
"Please wait for an overcast to visit. The sun can be blazing with lack of shape you will not make it through the whole garden. If enter before noon there no line, after noon the line wraps around. The Japanese exhibit was very small and disappointing."
"I have been coming to Botanical Garden for years, and it is a place filled of plenty of great memories that happen in different seasons and different periods of my life. The most recent visit is to come to see the tulip festival, since I won't be able to make it for the one in Ottawa, but honestly the one in Montreal really stunned me! It was splendid and the way how the tulips are planted is so different from the way how they arrange the tulips in Ottawa, which makes the Montreal tulip festival super cool and mesmerizing! In spring, we can see a lot of cherry blossom, lilac, peony, and so on in the garden; in summer, roses, lotus, hydrangeas, lilies are in full bloom; in fall, the magical lantern festival in the Chinese garden also amaze visitors, and even in winter, the Christmas garden sparkles and dazzles. There are so many things to do in the Botanical Garden and I always have a great time here!"
"Beautiful place to spend a day. On the expensive side, especially for non-Quebec residents. If you're a Montrealer, they have an Early Bird Card that costs $8 (!) that grants you access for ONE YEAR to the grounds between 6 and 9 AM. Great for runners and/or people who live in the area.The gardens are organized by type (e.g., rose, shrub, etc.), function (e.g., medicinal, edible, toxic), and theme (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Native). The gardens and paths are well maintained and there are lots of labels to tell you what's what. About half of the grounds (towards Rosemont) comprise the arboretum. A few notes about specific gardens... The Chinese gardens were undergoing renovations when we went, so the buildings were closed, but the gardens were otherwise open. There was a lot of construction fencing as well, which detracted from the garden's serenity, but it was still quite nice. There was a special exhibition at the Japanese gardens that featured some stunning works of art from survivors of Hiroshima. I would highly recommend spending some time there.They have a lantern festival every autumn, which I hear is quite spectacular."
"This place is full of people, but I can see why. Unlike many touristy spots, the Botanical Garden is full of rich cultural sections that not only have unique plants and information in a vast park - but very unique and well-planned architecture that makes you feel like you're engulfed in a completely different place.The Chinese garden is probably the most impressive. On the day that we went, we saw two separate wedding photo shoots on location, along with a mix of several park visitors that were soaking up the views.The Japanese garden and the greenhouse are two other locations that I would recommend visiting. The greenhouse has several different segments that have plants from tropical locations to the desert (you will feel the climate variances as you walk through each electric door opening).Do yourself a favor and visit this place - you will definitely find satisfaction."
"This is a must go to and a must see on any Montrealer worthy of being called one, love the events whether in the summer or fall it's a great place to be and take pictures or draw or walk around or for a quiet time with friends or family! K loved going for the Asian inspired events! One was called mosaiculture or something! All this to say it was nice"
First time here. Guessing I came atvtgecwrong tome un tge season. A lot of flowers weren't blooming and construction being done in certain areas. So far the botanical gardens in new york is still the best.
"Oh my heavens. What a gift to the world that garden is. I just wandered around for 7 hours... 10000 steps... and I only covered half of the hectares. Ok, I did take a 20 minute nap in a comfy chair under a tree. And I did sit and have a delicious vegetarian lunch overlooking a flower garden and surrounded by sparrows. But still. Seven hours of beauty and biodiversity and a smattering of people (not crowded, not empty) enjoying the great outdoors. So, so grateful. Thank you Montr√©al!"
We came here the weekend of April 23 2016. The dumb thing was we had purchased the tickets for both Bio Dome & Botanical Garden (Individual tickets $19 or $34 for both) at the same time. Turns out no one was checking for tickets when we arrived at the garden. Mostly because nothing had bloomed yet. It will be so beautiful in the warm summer months (late May to early Sept). The garden is absolutely serene and stunning even though nothing was out yet. My favourite was likely the Chinese garden. They finally scanned our tickets when we got inside the building to look at the green house plants. The area was a little tight and those who do not have the courtesy to move over to the side while admiring the plants held up the line. That was my major pet peeve. Loved the butterfly garden.
We wanted to do something besides walking around in the city so we went here. It's big to cross from one place to the next. I think my favorite part was the Asian gardens and the insect place. The insects there were so different granted I've seen ¬†these bug on tv but to see them in real life was different. Great most the the bug display are dead so nothing is going jump at you. It was the coolest part of the garden. I took the path to the right of the purchase booth but I wish I went right because they have a trolly that can drop you to different parts of the park so you would have to walk so far from one place to the next
Great day in the park. Beautiful place to visit whether you are a tourist or live in Montreal. The green houses were very cool. To see a banana tree growing in a greenhouse was a new thing for me. My only complaint is that there's too much to see in one trip!
The night show was my favorite part. I loved how they decorated the Chinese garden with several eliminated animals throughout. It was very beautiful! The daytime experience is just as nice. I would say that the ticket price is definitely worth it especially if you intend on seeing the night show as well.
"Lucked out with good weather ! Got off of train at station PIE- IX. Walked right up the hill one block. Huge amount of construction going on but there was police to redirect. The Olympique Stadium was on the opposite side of the road from the Jardin de Botanique. We took some pics along the way. Can't miss the entrance to Jardin de Botanique and there's a huge parking lot. There's information booths with a friendly receptionist that speaks both English and French. Multiple passes to choose from with different rates. If you are a student or resident - you get a discount. We chose Tix 1 where we got the Jardins and Insectorium. Right at the entrance there's a Boutique to buy garden stuff :). You walk in at hit the green houses and Bioderm area. Once again everything was English / French and staff were extremely friendly. We got there about Lunch time so before we ventured to through the gardens we decided to go for lunch at their restaurant. Pricey but did not disappoint. We had fresh roast chicken, salad and brown rice- with a glass of wine. Most people were just enjoying a small pastry and coffee - visiting and reading on their own. We then walked around - first garden the restaurant had a terrace - great for snapping shots. However that was the first one! So be prepared to do a lot of walking. You do have the option to trolley to the end and it's quite the distance so ask about it at the ticket area. There's specific stops and they don't do random stops. Insectorium is a small bug museum - if u like bugs. This place was catering to parties, museums and they do evening festivities. Look it up before you go. Take some bug spray and sunscreen. Also it was unfortunate the Chinese garden was closed and some of the flowers yet to bloom. But overall it was a day to be leisurely and enjoy the greenery!"
Great tourist attraction! The Jardin is home to a numerous number of both plants and insects. It's a great place to bring the family and enjoy a leisurely stroll through nature and learn about nature. The insectarium is both fun and a bit creepy but it was great learning about the different types of bugs. The Jardin has a beautiful Chinese garden and has spots for both medicinal and toxic plants. On Saturday they have great activities such as taking part in a tea party. Would recommend to any enthusiast! They gave plenty of cafes and bathrooms too! Bring water and stay hydrated.
"What a beautiful place to spend the day! ¬†So many different plants, flowers, and landscaping structures! ¬†Located on the grounds of the Space For Life Museum. ¬†Mostly outdoor but also quite a lot of indoor plants and flowers. ¬†Well worth to price of admission."
"A total of 30 incredible theme park form the main attraction to this site. The most famous of which is the Chinese Garden, which is dedicated to showcasing some bonsai features beautiful water. Snow falls in November and April, but the greenhouse complex remains open, and from February to April there is the exhibition ""Butterflies Go Free"", where thousands of butterflies and moths live tropical released into the greenhouse.My favorites were the Rose garden, Chinese garden, Japanese garden, Greenhouse, Edible vegetable, Alpine forest, etc.. ¬† Great place to spend a day ! !"
Just a beautiful park to spend the day... So many relaxing places just to sit and enjoy the peaceful view. ¬†Love the rose garden and Japanese Garden.
Absolutely gorgeous! ¬†Plan at least a day here as each garden is more wonderful than the next.
Had a wonderful time visiting the botanical garden in Montreal! We arrived before the sunset and beat the crowd that were here to see the garden of lights. I recommend you purchase your tickets online and show them on your phone to avoid long lines. We were in and out in 30 minutes.
**NOTE**When using google to search for Botanical Gardens the first images that come up are some large garden sculptures of sea creatures and all types of animals ¬†-- those have not been there for a very long time and were a temporary exhibit so don't make the mistake we made expecting to see those**A ticket for adult entry is $20. You get to see some amazing flowers and gardens. It's quite a bit of walking so wear comfortable shoes. Makes for a very relaxing day of site seeing. Definitely worth the trip.
"Beautiful, very large botanical gardens near the Olympic Stadium and Biodome. ¬†They have a nice selection of gardens including a rose, Alpine, Chinese, native, Japanese and lake which were all very well maintained and lush. ¬†Just note part of the Chinese garden are under renovations. ¬†The green house is nicely done as well. ¬†Feel like being grossed out, they have a large insectarium. It's a bit pricey for admission, I recommend doing the combined ticket for $33.50 which also includes the Biodome."
"My favorite botanical garden is in San Francisco, when you wander down into the wood, surrounded by redwoods and a creek, with nary a city sound whispering through the pines. But this is a close second. To me, a botanical garden is an escape from the city. I'm not really a plant person, despite my love of the botanical garden, but I love the opportunity to wander into my own quiet, and to have a nice view while I do so. This garden did not disappoint. The Chinese garden is a superb example, calming, and almost like I was transported miles and miles east. And its examples of bonzai were phenomenal. Not only did I learn a ton about the work that goes into bonzai, but I simply have to respect a 270 tree that is smaller than a toddler.I also fell in love with the English vertical crevasse garden. Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously some people, but not me. And now I want one. Thanks a lot, Jardin botanique.When I'm back in Montreal I'll definitely visit again. Sure, my spouse might be left in peaceful repose on a chaise somewhere, but that's okay, I'll get my own city escape, all to myself."
"Hands down my favorite botanical garden and I've visited every one I have been able to wherever I travel. You have to spend time in the Japanese Gardens -- beautiful! I spent at least 2 hours in the gardens and saw maybe 25% of them. I will definitely visit this again and will set aside at least 4+ hours to walk through. The insectarium is small and has a couple really cool parts -- one being the ant farm. The ant farm shows ants taking food to their habitat -- you can see the ants carrying the pieces of food back and forth. Highly worth a visit (See my Insectarium review for more information).If you come to Montreal (or live in Montreal), this is a must see! Try to make it a cooler day if possible, otherwise wear very comfortable and cool clothes. Although I had the Montreal museum pass (well worth it if you plan on visiting multiple museums), I believe the Insectarium is part of the cost for the Botanical Gardens as the Insectarium is within the gardens.The Gardens are in the same area of the Olympic Stadium, Planetarium, Biodome, and a couple other activities. If you need to ""give up"" something, it shouldn't be the Botanical Gardens."
"Possibly all the reviews slamming the lack of blooming plants are more about people not understanding that seasons act differently in different zones. Remember that you're above the 44th parallel here, so more than likely things will be blooming later than where you live.That said, this is a fantastic place to visit. Yes, the Chinese Garden won't reopen until 2017, but the Japanese Garden is worth spending some contemplative time in. The Lilacs were in bloom while we were there; the Native American space is worth an amble through."
"Tips - wear comfortable shoes and clothes. ¬†You will walk and walk and walk - you get the picture. I would take a blanket and a picnic lunch and a refillable water bottle is a must.Give yourself 4-6 hours to look around - all day if you want to see the entire park.I LOVED the insectorium!We were there for the lantern show which was a nice little bonus, although it was a bit crowded.Easy walk from metro Pie IX"
This probably the best part of the area. ¬†It seems to be the only area that is still being properly upkeep. ¬†The surrounding area of the olympic is very desolate. ¬†Depending on the time of the year you might not be able to see too much. ¬†But if you come during the right time it is beautiful.
"I visited Montreal for the first time in over ten years over the summer and I had to be one of the most amazing trips I have ever taken. The Botanical Gardens were the highlight of my trip. It is so relaxing just walking around and enjoying nature. The views are absolutely breathtaking! There is also quaint little outdoor cafe that serves fantastic cocktails and a few small plates! They gardens are located near many of Montreal's other attractions including the Biodome, Planetarium, Insectarium, and Olympic Stadium. You easily can, and should, make a day out of it!!!"
"I would recommend visiting here if one is in Montreal. I would suggest taking the subway there because parking is limited. The garden is so large that the admission ticket is good for 2 days. When I was there, there was a special exhibit going on called Mosaicultures, which was the most impressive topiary exhibit I have ever seen. The Chinese garden also has many lanterns in various forms, shaped like animals or people, which are lit up at night. There are also many greenhouses with different types of plants inside. There are also a Japanese garden, a First Nations garden, and a big collection of bonsai trees."
"Best greenhouses we have ever visited. ¬†We didn't even go outside to the outdoor section because it was probably 5 degrees F outside. ¬†The beauty of the greenhouses is unmatched by any I have seen previous - the people who work here really know their stuff. ¬†The selection and placement of plants is astounding. ¬†I think it's easy to overlook all of the planning and work that goes into creating and maintaining a collection such as this. ¬†It's just phenomenal.There was an exhibition titled ""1000 jours"" (1000 days), which summarizes the collective human footprint upon the planet. ¬†The theme is sustainability, and there were a number of different exhibits within this area that promoted sustainability and responsible living. ¬†Some of the more impactful ones centered around the world's imperiled amphibian populations. ¬†Others were about our high demand for products such as shark fins and sea turtle eggs. ¬†There was video of sharks being caught, de-finned, and tossed back into the ocean to die slow deaths. ¬†The practice of collecting endangered sea turtle eggs for human consumption was also shown, with touching stories of individuals and organizations trying to make changes. ¬†It makes you think and want to act. ¬†We are very happy we went here.The price of admission includes visits to the Insectarium, so be sure to visit both!"
"We decided to walk here after visiting the Biodome. The problem? It was a 90-something degree day and the walk isn't as close as tourist sites will have you believe. If you have trouble walking, please take the mini train! If you're just parking at the Biodome, then it will be a slightly closer walk because the garage is a little closer. The admission for 2 adults was about $40, which we thought was quite high just to view gardens. We are from Boston and our Arboretum is completely free. We visited in August (with what seemed like half the world), and hardly any flowers were in bloom. The green plants were there, but you can only look at so much greenery before you're bored.The best part, in my opinion, were the structures of China in the Chinese garden and the animals sculptures throughout the park. Were they worth the $40? Heck no... I think there should be a discount during the months where flowers are nowhere to be found.*Tip: Go during a festival time where there is more to see. That will make the price tag more worth it."
"Horrible experience, in may there is nothing to see... NOTHING!you pay 20 bucks to walk around and see a couple of Chinese gazeboes, pounds and tree...NO EXHIBITIONS... NOTHING...the bars were closed...It was pretty hard to find the fountains were to drink, even using the map.I felt like they stole my money..."
"What a remarkable site. We saw things here that we've never seen anywhere else.The edible garden was my favorite, so many varieties of herbs, vegetables and the like, perfectly organized, it's mind boggling.It seems like every piece of the property was well thought out, they built some rolling hills to accentuate the various flowers and shrubbery. The bug display inside was really cool too.Definitely worth checking out!"
"I was very disappointed to find out the main attraction I came to see was no longer in exhibit. If you are like me who checked out their site to see pictures of the landscape art on the main page but didn't get an opportunity to see in person while here I feel bad for you too. But, you're in luck, the entire gardens were beautiful and breathtaking! I wish I could have stayed all day here. I felt very relaxed and blissful while walking around and seeing so many pretty flowers and greenery. My fondest memory is sitting in lawn chairs with my bf now fianc√© and just enjoying the moment. I will never forget. Try to purchase tickets in advance so you can just walk in and enjoy all the scenery!"
This was a disappointing experience. Major sections are closed off for renovation or removed for the season. They should be charging discounted rates until the renovation is done.
"Went there in early spring so they just started planting everything so I won't hold that against them. What they did have was very nice. The tulips were beautiful, the trees were flowering everywhere. The Chinese garden with all the bonsai trees was spectacular.Not very expensive and we found a 2 for 1 coupon which made it even cheaper. Also if you want to see the bio-dome, get your tickets here, then you can skip the very long line over there."
"Ok I'm a really bad person and don't love flowers so much in general, so this review isn't totally fair. The issue was why don't they have little snack bars set up around this place? I almost starved to death at one point but fortunately my wife had half a protein bar left in her bag.They could just set up a few stands along the way with some cookies or hot dogs or whatever."
"Highly recommend to those visiting Montreal. Very pricey, but getting lost in the gardens was one of the highlights of my trip this summer.Grounds are gorgeous and sections are themed by areas of the world. Japanese gardens in particular were stunning. My little sister loved the Native American section where they had a legit teepee and wigwam.TREEBEARD was undoubtedly the coolest part.PLEASE take note: the massive hedge sculptures were a temporary exhibit. Hopefully this will save you from having a melt down at the entrance like I did.Still worth the visit."
"Absolutely breathtaking and fantastic! Great place for a date (trust me) and one of the biggest and most comprehensive insectarium I've ever seen! From the giant green sculptures to the serene Asian inspired gardens, this place was worth every penny.Stop reading and come here! It's a must see!ps: bring your student ID if you have one!"
"This review is based on my visit in fall when most of the plants were in hibernation and my personal views as an adult visitor. ¬†I would rate this 4 stars if I took children here.My friend and I visited the Jardin Botanique during the 2015 lantern festival. Most of the shrubbery had gone into hibernation due to the cool weather. I think this is why the Jardin Botanique holds the lantern festival.We were excited to here about the Chinese/Japanese lantern festival. Even though a lot of effort went into putting it together (it's a 1-year process), we thought the displays and the lights were tacky. Many other adults and all of the children loved the display. ¬†What can I say? My friend and I are jaded and have travelled internationally and prefer the real thing.There was a good demonstration of chinese shadow puppetry and the person who talked about it was very knowledgeable. ¬†I would rate that part of the visit 5 stars.I enjoyed looking at the bonsai trees in the Japanese Garden. For some reason, I thought there would be many more bonsais than what I saw there. I found the Japanese Garden to be my favorite part of the gardens in the month of October given that many garden plants go into hibernation when autumn hits Montreal.If I had children, I would rate this as 4-stars. If you're not a child, it's not necessary to visit this attraction if you're short on time and can occupy yourself with other things to do. This attraction was relatively easy to get to using public transit as it is very close to the subway/metro."
Love this place every season. Be ready to walk around this complex. So many things to see. Still haven't checked out their sky stadium
"Exquisite gardens - don't miss anything (spend all day there) or come back many times! The cafe had the yummiest, healthiest ""Bol Buddha"" salad I've ever tasted."
Loved walking these gorgeous grounds! The staff was very friendly and super helpful (had bandaids and fixed up our 5-year old daughter in two minutes). Absolutely loved the artists installments but I was a little bummed to have missed the sculptures that you always see on Pinterest and the Chinese gardens. The Japanese gardens are a must see!
"Breathtaking. The gardens are absolutely beautiful. I wasn't able to see much, but it was absolutely stunning. The gardens are well cared for very photogenic. I spent majority of the time in the greenhouses and the Chinese Garden before closing. The Chinese garden felt like looking at China though a looking glass. The buildings were of traditional Chinese architecture and it was fun taking photos with it. We also saw a bit of the Japanese garden, but were a bit disappointed because it was rather small and didn't feel like taking a glimpse of Japan as I felt like when in the Chinese garden."
The Botanical Gardens is a gem for the sites in that area. ¬†Worth only visiting here. ¬†The quality and variety of the plants was mind boggling. ¬†There were so many places to just sit and enjoy. ¬†We had a picnic in the park. ¬†We also took advantage of the Insectarium which was interesting but not as amazing as the park itself.
One of the most beautiful botanical gardens I have visited. What a peaceful morning I had there.
I thought it was just a huge garden but it turned out to be like an amusement park for the kids. If you are resident get an Access Montreal card and the entrance will be free.
$18.50 for adults/$14 for students for both the garden and insectariumI was here 2nd week of May 2014. The place is massive. The Chinese garden was lovely and way prettier than the Japanese garden. The Japanese garden seems like a good place for a picnic. There was a Japanese show/performance when we visited on a Sunday afternoon. The flowers weren't in full bloom though so that was quite disappointing. I find the insecatarium very boring as well.
"I visited the Montr√©al Botanical Garden during the beginning/warm part of fall. On its 75 hectares, it features numerous distinct gardens. Some of my favorite gardens were the arid/desert, Chinese, and Japanese. I also really enjoyed the plants that were grown into the shapes of animals, such as a horse, duck, gorilla, and panda. The paths around the gardens were very crowded with people, so I had some difficulty with seeing around/over people and walking. Overall, this garden is huge and has many pretty plants to see. I recommend visiting during a time of year that is less crowded with people."
"My friends and I were excited to visit this botanical garden. We researched so many things before going to Montreal and this place was always recommended. So we gave it a shot. Once we got there we realized that their grass is not taken care of whatsoever. There's a lot of weeds. That was the first thing we saw that was bothering. Botanical garden can't even take care of their grass?! Come on bro! Second, practically all the exhibitions were closed that day. We didn't even get a warning at the ticket booth/entrance. A lot of exhibitions were under renovation or just closed. Third, there was confusion getting back inside the greenhouse. The security didn't let us back in through, so we had to go through another main entrance. Overall, this botanical garden sucked."
"This place is just fantastic. ¬†I would come back here again on my next trip to Montreal. ¬†A little pricey to get in ($29.50 for regular adult, $22.50 for student), but I was definitely oh-ing and ah-ing the whole way through. ¬†But, I think a lot of this is due to the International Mosaicultures event that was exhibiting while I was there. ¬†Of course, there were a ton of tourists and it was crowded as heck, but I guess if anything, it's just a validation of the fact that you probably came to the right place to sight-see.The jardin definitely seems huge and I didn't get to go through the whole place, but I would like to go back to do so and maybe see whatever new exhibits they have going on. ¬†I will say that the bug exhibit is super awesome. ¬†It's definitely a bit disgusting, but man, I never knew so many different kinds of amazing looking insects exist! ¬†It's really extraordinary and I think that's the vibe of this whole place. ¬†It makes you realize how beautiful our world is and how much we messed it all up. ¬†It's awesome that a lot of the beauty that our world has to offer has been encapsulated and curated so that we could enjoy it for years to come.Now that I think about it, while the price is steep, it's more than worth it to take a peek at what our natural world looks like undisturbed. ¬†Awesome."
I visited in a few botanical gardens in the world and this one is not very impressing. Of you are on a tight schedule I would skip that experience.
"We came late in the day just as the clouds had broken. The sun glistening on the droplets, the flowers in full bloom, my love by my side. What better time time to ask..."
"The Montreal botanical gardens are rapidly becoming one of my favorite places in the city to visit. ¬† It's one part of the Montreal Space for Life which also includes the Biodome, Insectarium and the Planetarium. It's a 75 hectare National Historic Site of Canada and is considered one of the most important botanical gardens in the world. ¬†Just a short walk from the Pie-IX metro station it's open year round. Containing 22,000 species spread throughout 10 greenhouses and 30 gardens many of which are located outside the place is huge. Montrealers can check out the outside stuff for free.There're special events and exhibitions all year and many of them are actually quite good. ¬†Walk amongst thousands of butterflies in the ""Butterflies Go Free"" exhibit held annually ¬†from February to April. Gardeners will be interested in the annual plant sale held in May. It's worth checking out their website to see all the stuff going on.Open all year, continually changing, educational and family friendly, the only real downside is that tickets can be steep. ¬†Starting at $15 for Quebecers, special events sometimes cost a bit more. The gardens are big enough though that it will take hours to get through just a portion. The International Mosaicultures event currently on until the end of September 2013 runs $25 but the ticket is actually valid for two visits. Of course, the outside bits won't cost you a dime.It's a fun and educational outing that breaks up the monotony of city life and breaks you out of the rut of cocktails, live music, performance art hipster routine."
"If you are visiting Montreal, definitely make this one of your places to visit. Parking here is $10/day. If you can, take the metro. The gardens are a short walk from the Pie-IX metro stop. We went during a Saturday afternoon, probably around 3-4pm. The line to get in was huge! They have free wifi near the ticket booths, so use your smart phone to go to their website to purchase tickets - it'll save you about 30 minutes in wait time! Then just show your phone when you go to walk in. Jardin Botanique accepts student ID's from the US so we were able to get ¬†in at discounted rates.There are clean bathrooms and drinking fountains throughout many of the buildings within the gardens. Save your money and skip out on buying a water bottle at one of the stands.The gardens are absolutely wonderful. You must make it a point to see the Chinese and Japanese gardens - two of my favorite areas within this place."
"What a beautiful garden. My husband and I decided ¬†at Christmas last year that we were going to Montreal for a vacation. He also had a few surprises up his sleeve, tickets for arcade fire at parc jean drapeau. I'm such a lucky lady.  ¬† Anyhow, the afternoon of the concert we had a few hours to spare so we headed to the gardens for a lovely afternoon of sightseeing. The entrance fee was a bit steep, but if you have a AAA you will receive a discount. The ticket cost also included the insectarium, which I opted out of because I'm a wimp that does not care for insects.  ¬†The garden is massive, and features many different styles, even featuring desiduous plants native to my hubs home state of Colorado. I would have to say my favorite areas were the lake, the Asian gardens and the tree troll. The troll was a lot more difficult to find than I thought it would be. I wish we had more time to enjoy the park, maybe with a picnic of assorted french cheeses and a nice bottle of wine.  ¬† I hope to return in the future and spent more time in the park, it was so lovely and I will remember it until my dieing day. I only wish that I had been fortunate enough to see the temporary topiary show that was at the garden last summer, but all in all I was not disappointed. It is a must see for all, tourists and natives alike."
The Montreal Botanical Garden is beautiful. I'm glad I was able to walk around through the various gardens and appreciate all the flowers in bloom. They have an extensive collection of glass houses filled with exotic plants from all over the world. Quite magnificent. I really loved being able to walk around in nature and take photos. Highly recommend if you are a nature lover. This is next to the Biodome as well - so why not kill 2 birds with one stone if you have the time. (Note: Don't confuse this with the little garden next to the Biosphere which is a different museum. It happens to the best of us!)
"It is a true gem. I have been coming here since I was a baby and I just cannot get tired of it because they always update, change, add new features, and have special events on the regular basis (like the pumpkins for Halloween, the Chinese lanterns in the fall, the ice sculptures in the winter). If you live in Montreal and own an Acc√®s Montreal card, you get in for free (and the card is just 8$, cheaper than a single ticket to get in). This summer, they had a rich series of concerts at various places around the garden on the weekends: Jazz, tango, classical, pop... Then you just have to sit back in the grass and relax while listening and enjoying the view. These were magic moments. Besides that, the food at the restaurant is very decent but it is on the longer side to wait in line (it is cafeteria style). That being said, when you go spend time there, it usually is because you are not in a rush and ready to take your time, so in that mindset, it is ok to wait. Little kids will enjoy the shuttle ride around the garden and the park near the insectarium. Parents will be happy to find a breastfeeding/ baby feeding/ diaper changing room in the main pavilion near the ticket booths, and changing stations in most bathrooms all around the garden. Easy to access by bus or metro; there is a parking too ($). Thank you city of Montreal for maintaining ¬†this amazing place."
"The most beautiful lily garden I have seen in my life. It was spectacular. The biggest problems with the botanic garden: 1) confusing signage, 2) poor public transit options to the gardens and 3) not enough time to tour the gardens! Otherwise, it's a place not to be missed. Truly lovely gardens."
"This is, by far the most amazing botanical gardens I have ever been to. The flowers are incredible, the landscapes are so complex and interesting, and the Japanese garden is amazing in the fall with all of the lanterns. If you are planning a trip to Montreal, make sure this is a stop on your way and hopefully you'll be here in the fall for the lanterns. Bringing a picnic lunch and a book to read can be the best decision of your vacation."
"Me: Good morning, admission for two.Attendant: Oh, you're here to see the butterflies?Me: What butterflies?The attendant throws two tickets at me as if she was folding a bad poker hand.Our last day in Montreal was spent at the Botanical Garden and we arrived just in time for their butterfly exhibit. ¬†Imagine hundreds of butterflies flying in a room, landing on people's unsuspecting shoulders, and settling on fruit laid out so you can photograph them. ¬†Unfortunately, we went in early spring and the outside gardens had not bloomed yet and the Japanese gardens / Insectorium were closed. ¬†Their main building had an impressive collection of bonzi trees and were educational about spices (cardamom pods, vanilla, cinnamon, etc). ¬†The Chinese gardens were impressive and a picturesque setting. ¬†Remember, if the ticket attendant asks if you are there for something, just agree so you won't have to pick your tickets up from the ground."
"Visited here for the 2nd time. Very large park with an extensive variety of plants from all over the world. Many areas to explore. There are plenty of spots to stop and sit on benches and chairs. Since it is still late spring, many plants were not in bloom yet. However, we managed spending 3 hours here and enjoyed our visit. Highly recommended."
Visit the Chinese Garden the architecture was pretty amazing :-) I would suggest visiting during the warmer months since more exhibitions are open. It looks like they take advantage of the colder months to renovate and fix things up.
"Decided to fork out the quite pricey admission fee to visit during the Mosaicultures International and the Garden of Lights. Both of these events are well worth seeing as they are very beautiful displays. The Mosaicultures which ends by the 29th of Sept is made up of about 40 sculptures made from plants basically. Some of them are huge and they are all amazing to view. The Bird Tree took them like 6 years to make, thats how much effort goes in to these. The Garden of Lights is an annual nightly event through the Fall where the Chinese Garden is filled with Lanterns of all different things from animals to warriors and the Japanese Gardens is also lit up. This is also very nice to see. Admission during this time allows you two visits if you were not visiting at a time to see them both or I just passed the ticket on to someone else.Admission also includes entry to the Insectarium which is interesting but didn't take me more than 30mins to explore. During the year when these events are not on, admission is cheaper but still a little expensive so you would really have to appreciate the gardens to pay the fee. The Gardens are quite big and you could spend a few hrs just wandering the paths all the way to the other end where the Tree House and arboretum is and the green houses are quite good.Overall, if you're going during these events be prepared for lots of people but otherwise pick a nice day and enjoy the gardens."
"This is the first botanical garden i have ever been to :)....and i must say...i wasnt dissapointed...We didnt see the entire garden...from what i saw...i liked the chinese garden, Japanese garden and the greenhouse the most...Rose garden was lame...we could practically count the roses in the garden...the insectarium which is part of this establishment was good...though it did not have many live species...it did keep us on our toes with the few live ones...its a nice learning experience..."
"Botanical garden was a nice stroll for the family. We took the tram to tree center. They Chinese garden was closed but we saw some of the pretty lantern outside. It was a shame that it was closed. We also went to the Japanese garden but nothing to compared to the Chinese garden. We also liked the insectarium, got to hold a cucaracha. ¬†Saw so many different bug species. The roses and water lilies were beautiful. It was a warm day but they had water fountain everywhere to keep hydrated."
"Maybe I just lucked up, but I was able to walk right up to the cashier and get a ticket to go in (it was during the week, to be fair). Talk about HUGE. Here I thought Atlanta had a pretty decent-sized garden for being stuck in the middle of a city, but leave it to Canada to show us up in all the right ways. The Japanese and Chinese gardens here were highly impressive - you almost feel like you're walking through an Asian festival with all of the lanterns and artwork! The other areas were nice as well, and there's really quite a lot to see. If it's a plant or flower known to science, it's bound to be here somewhere. Between all of the paths, green houses, and gazebos, it's easy to get lost and lose track of time in this nature wonderland stuck between the concrete jungle outside.I remember it being a little expensive, but it certainly was worth every penny. I didn't even get to see the entire thing (I walked a good 3/4 of the place though) and would love to come back and experience the rest in the spring versus the fall when I went. Very nice collection, great way to get exercise, and a real fun spot for any nature lover. Good job, Montr√©al!"
A botanical garden of immense beauty. We were there for the butterfly expo where you are surrounded by butterflies going all over the place. Pretty awesome.
"We were strolling in the park one, in the very merry month of May. It was a little bit overcast and a little bit rainy, but it wasn't crowded at all. The Chinese gardens were probably the most beautiful part of the park, and we could have easily spent the whole day here, but since we were only in Montreal for a week we had to move quickly, especially since we slept in and half of the day was already over. The park is huge and it has indoor greenhouse gardens that are loaded with beautiful flowers. The BF is a bit of a queer *cough* I mean gardener, so he was pointing out the flowers by all their Latin names and throwing random factoids at me about what makes each plant so special which was like being back in biology 101. Annuals, semi-annuals, bulbs... I don't care as long as they look pretty! On special occasions I am required to buy him flowers! How does that work?! If you have the time, you should definitely check out the Jardin Botanique de Montreal. If you are travelling, there is a train station (Pie IX) very close to the gardens, and it is also very close to the old Olympic site and Biodome."
"If you hate nature and walking around for long periods of time this is not the place for you, otherwise it's a must see when visiting this beautiful city. The Montreal Botanical Gardens is HUGE so if you want to see everything expect to be there for about six hours. I am not exaggerating.My friend and I went last year during in the early fall when they had all the lanterns in the Chinese Gardens. It was absolutely beautiful. The Chinese Garden's themselves is quite a sight to see as well, and it is quite spacious. Another thing we enjoyed were the vegetable gardens. There was literally every kind of food that comes from the ground being grown there: vegetables, herbs, fruits... we were tempted to swipe an onion to include with our dinner feast later that night but there are signs all over telling us that they take vegetable theft very seriously so we ended up not doing it. I recommend that anyone visiting (or living in) Montreal go check this out at least once, as kit was one of the more pleasurable non-nightlife experiences on my trip.*Tip* Wear comfortable shoes. You will end up being there for much longer than you planned and there is A LOT of walking involved."
"I recently visited for the Chinese Lanterns. Although I did not get to visit the entire place, the Chinese Lanterns were breathtaking. ¬†If you want to get great photos, of course your first thought is to go when it's dark out. ¬†This is true, somewhat. ¬†The perfect time is to go right before the sun sets. ¬†Comparing the photos I took, the images when it was still somewhat light out came out much better than the night ones (although I did get some nice ones).There was also a ""Little Monsters"" section for the kids. Of course, I am a kid at heart and ran through myself.The rating lacks 2 stars because I was a little mislead about the Chinese Lanterns. ¬†One the website and the brochure, it mentions ""The Lanterns in Music"". ¬†When reading that, I expected to see was the story of the Emperor (the theme this year) told to music....instead, after waiting around for 45 minutes, we found out that it was just music in one of the little areas....NOTHING to do with the actual lanterns. Major bummer."
"Beautiful !!!..didn't have enough time to see the entire place, but everything we saw was beautiful. It felt so relaxing and peaceful, it has that old French Country feel. It is definitely a must when visiting Montreal. If I lived here I definitely would get a pass."
"Insane long wait to get in, 4 cashiers for 200 people when we got there, each person taking 2-3 minutes to pay to enter. ¬†I supervised tickets at the stampede, it usually takes 10 sec per person, if the computers are out maybe 30 sec, this took 2-3 min per person.I'd fire the person in charge of the entrance gates, it's insanely slow to get in. ¬† 2 hour wait. ¬†If the day was hot people would be passing out from heat strokes. ¬†Bonus: we didn't get a map of the gardens..."
"Lovely gardens near the Olympic Stadium in Montreal. They're quite large (takes 15 min tk just walk from one end of the grounds to the other!) and have a variety of climates and garden themes, from tropical to poisonous to my favorite, the decades old potted trees from East Asia. Very popular spot with families, as there were many children running through the exhibits."
Quebec residents get discount and rarely ask for proof only postal code. CAA members extra 2 dollars off.
"This site is incredibly beautiful and huge! ¬†The botanical gardens are well worth a visit if you are in or near Montreal. ¬†The Chinese Garden was particularly captivating. ¬†Plus, while you are there, you can wander across the street to check out the Olympic Park. ¬†My advise: ¬†Plan to spend a lot of time here. ¬†There is a lot to see and you do not want to be rushed. ¬†There is a decent amount of cultural information presented in addition to gardens. ¬†Definitely wear comfortable shoes.You need to pay to see the indoor gardens. ¬†They were neat, but perhaps unnecessary, as the outdoor gardens were so extensive. ¬†I am unsure whether or not you need to pay to go outside. ¬†Our tickets were not checked as we went in, the information on the website is inconclusive, and another reviewer mentioned outside being free. ¬†If you are planning a trip here, I would inquire about what the ticket price covers before paying."
"Absolutely beautiful! There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when we went to visit, and while we didn't get to see any of the landscaping, festive lights, or seasonal decorations, we did see beautiful, well maintained trees and fresh snow everywhere. ¬†We took a long walk through the park, ended up standing on top of a frozen lake (on purpose) and got to enjoy the cool breeze without many other visitors."
"This is a beautiful place, but it all depends on the season. I've been here three times over the last 8 years or so and each time different areas are in bloom or look prettier than others. But areas that don't disappoint are: The Chinese and Japanese gardens as well as the greenhouses. My advice is to pick a few areas and enjoy them fully, rather than rushing and trying to see the whole park."
"These are some gorgeous gardens. More than half of the grounds are an arboretum, so bring your walking shoes ¬†(as suggested in other posts). My favorite is the alpine garden - plants from every mountain range in the world. Little known fact - the outdoor gardens are actually free until April 30. Not a whole lot is blooming, but the grass is green and the trees are budding. A great, 2 hour walk."
The best botanical gardens I have ever been to. ¬†Just absolutely and completely the best. ¬†And it is huge!! ¬†Go check it out...you will be glad you did!
"We typically wouldn't go to the botanical gardens, but we planned to meet a friend there. They had a few special exhibits going on (Halloween and Chinese lanterns). I've only been to the Phipps Conservatory before, and relatively speaking, this one lacked the same amount of creativity. However, there was a ton to look at across the property. We were also told that you could get discounted tickets for the biodome if you buy them the same day. The Chinese lantern display was very well done and we didn't even get to see it at night."
"Our mistake was going too early in the season. Most areas (rose garden, chinese garden) were not ready... And we were still charged the full price for entry. Insectarium was small and nothing special. The greenhouses were the only saving grace. If you have to do one thing, I would recommend the Biodome over the Botanical Garden in the Spring. I'm sure it's lovely in the summer."
"Absolutely beautiful...but...it's huge. Which is wonderful if you have lots of time to kill and lots of energy stored, but if you're tired and it's terribly sunny and you forgot your sunglasses at the hotel, you kind of wanna just curl up on a bench in the shade and nap. Student discount :) When you first walk in, there are a bunch of interconnected greenhouses. It's pretty nice, nothing too crazy. I liked the section with all the fruits and spices from around the world. Walking around, there are all these amazing thematic gardens. Everybody seems to love the Chinese Garden and it was very pretty, but it was sooo overrun with people that I couldn't really enjoy it. My fav was the Alpine garden. Very quiet and simple. All the gardens are well maintained and gorgeous. Wish I went there with more energy but after covering only about a third of the park, I was craving poutine and a beer :)Worth it if you can appreciate the hard work put into making these beautiful gardens and have the time and energy to see the whole place."
"We came here while visiting Montreal on a tour. ¬†We ventured on our own time. ¬†It was well worth the money and time to spend a few hours here. ¬†The gardens were beautiful, but the best spot was the Japanese Garden and the Chinese Garden. ¬†Very peaceful and gorgeous!"
"I'm not a nature-lover by any means - I'll take the concrete jungle and the great indoors over green grass and open air any day. ¬†The Montreal botanical garden was really nice and gave me a tad more appreciation for the outdoors. ¬†There are many photo opps from the Chinese garden to the weeping willows of the Arboretum to the koi pond and crooked bridge of the Japanese Garden. ¬†Parts of it are really artificial like the stone mountain but this is a family/tourist attraction so I'll let it go. ¬†There's so much to see with each specialty garden, green house and plant collection."
"I am just getting to my yelp reviews..I went to Montreal for the jazz fest in July...a friend told me to go to the gardens...but just said ""it was nice""...it was splendid...so peaceful. I sat in an area of flowers and felt like I was in a Monet impressionism painting...the Asian area was so meditative...it was worth what ever the fee was if you like this sort of thing. Easy to get to on the subway."
"4.5 stars!Second time coming here. The first time was in March and the weather was too cold for the outside gardens. We had an amazing time exploring the different plants and flowers indoors, as well as attending the ""Butterflies Go Free"" events, it was crowded (long line) but worth the wait. The butterflies were beautiful are released in the greenhouse and would sometimes land on your clothes. Second visit was this past weekend (mid of July), we mainly visited the gardens outside and the Insectarium (which was closed for renovation the last time we came). It's rose season and it's absolutely gorgeous in the gardens, all types of flowers were blossoming. The gardens all have their little theme - Rose garden, Chinese garden, Japanese garden, Alphine garden, First nations garden. It's a great relaxing hike in the Arboretum area when not too hot and plenty of people relaxes on the grass next to the water and otherwise. It's quite stunning and you really could spend many hours here exploring the different types of flora and plants. The Insectarium is relatively small, but fun, I got to hold an insect resembling a leaf (harmless) while the staff taught us interesting facts. The beef hive (clear glass) was very interesting as well. They also have a wall calendar in the front lobby where they indicate the types of plants and flowers blossoming for each month. A combination of ticket is offered with Insectarium, Biodome (also quite special) and the Olympic tower. Worth a visit with plenty to explore and re-explore."
"The price is a little high but the gardens are lovely and very well maintained! I am delighted that we went and wish that we had allowed more time to enjoy the gardens. A couple of hours was not nearly enough and we didn't get around to all of the areas. That was a miscalculation on our part, for sure. The Chinese garden was particularly lovely and the lotus flowers were enchanting. We also really enjoyed the tour of the Japanese Tea Garden. You have to wait around for the guides your of this section because it isn't open to the public. It is very peaceful and the guide gives lots of interesting information."
"Came to see Le Magie des Lanterns....let me tell you it was spectacular! Came on the last day, Halloween, at night. All the lanterns were beautifully lit and it just made the Chinese gardens even more splendid. The bonsai plants were truly amazing. Also the Insectarium was really cool! A lot of live bugs and it was truly creepy and definitely Halloween. Walking through the greenhouses made the chilly night warm and see the Citrouille decorated (that's pumpkins!) just made it feel perfect. All in all, Montreal you are blessed with this place!"
"This place is a great place to walk if you are into plants, flowers, or manicured grounds. The Montreal Botanical Garden (French: Jardin botanique de Montr√©al) is a large botanical garden in Montreal, Quebec, Canada comprising 185 acres of thematic gardens and greenhouses.There is a Japanese, Chinese Garden. First Nations Garden which is populated with Canadian plants; the maple, birch, and pine trees shade its paths. It has several totem poles and exhibits demonstrating traditional Native American artwork and construction methods. ¬†The Alpine Garden has several paths winding over a rocky outcrop which is covered with tiny, delicate alpine plants.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a nice peaceful place to stroll, even if you are not into flowers or plants."
"Unfortunately, I, as of yet, haven't been able to make it into the actual botanical gardens. I did, however get to go out onto the non-ticketed patio and order a drink. Long line and it takes a while to get one, but the waitstaff were friendly enough. There was live jazz music that provided a nice ambience. The patio was very crowded, though. I had to take a seat on a bench in the back, so perhaps I should've made it there a bit earlier.What I was really there for was to enjoy the ambience along with a red wine. I ordered the Illuminati Riparosso Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 2009. Definitely not the best. Not really that good at all, but it was bearable. 5$ per glass, so not that big a loss. Nice menu, otherwise, though, and they had some interesting non-alcoholic drinks on there, too."
"We headed here to have some photos taken after our wedding.The price is a little steep compared to other Botanical Gardens (roughly $17 plus taxes) plus parking (another $10) and not all customer service reps are bilingual, which was a little difficult for tourists like me. No photo permit was needed for the professional photos, you just pay the admission of the photographers.We only had time to explore the Chinese, Japanese and Native American gardens, but they were completely stunning. You could easily spend the entire day exploring this place, it is truly breath-taking. Bring a water bottle (there are fountains where you can refill it), comfy shoes, sunscreen and your camera!"
I adored these gardens!! This year (2013) is the mosaicultures internationales montreal (MIM) - basically the Olympics of gardening. This only happens every four years and each time in a different country so if you ever want to go to the gardens it should be now! The gardens from each country were very beautiful and full of meaning... we had a guide (can get a free guide in the morning) but the plaques near each garden tell the stories of each garden well. It is more busy on the weekend so go on the weekday if you can and either go early or in the later afternoon. Also - your entry fee gets you into the insectarium which you can visit on a separate day - my 2.5 yr old nephew really loved both the gardens and the insectarium so it was well worth it! Also - cheaper if you have an access montreal pass (need to be a MTL resident) or if you are a student.
"Beautiful!These gardens are wonderful with lots to take in, This is definately a place to visit if you are visiting Montreal. My only advice is to allow an entire day for this tourist attraction. If you have kids make sure you seek out the kid attractions such as the tree house and the native garden."
"It's a gorgeous summer day and you're looking for a place to catch a break and get away...to avoid the crushing crowds of the First Friday food truck crowds, to read a book at one of the dozens of adirondack chairs hiding under the beautiful trees, to be able to stop and smell the (many many varieties of lovely) roses (literally)....then this is your place. ¬†It'll set you back about $20 CD, but well worth it. ¬†The highlights: the Chinese garden, friendly and helpful staff, foxes roaming the grounds (they come out when things start to shut down), and just the peaceful and quiet beauty and happy, relaxed people visiting (oh, and you're one of them!) :) Didn't have time to check out the insectarium or greenhouse....but saving that for my next visit. ¬†Definitely worth spending some time here. ¬†(Note on the foxes: just don't feed 'em and don't get too comfortable with 'em, one looked a little too tame and got a little bit bold with a kid at one of the playgrounds, approaching him awfully closely...no harm done, but still, they're wild...)"
"Alright, not in LA, but still this place was amazing! I was here a few years ago and I just have to say I want to go back. Montreal is an amazing city with amazing places to go and see. To be honest, the Gardens, hell I could have spent all week there. I still didn't get my fill of there Japanese Garden which was lovely, and so much better than the ones at Huntington or Descanso. They also had this artist there that made the most interesting kind of art. I just hope I get to go back one day to really enjoy the place."
"My favorite part was learning about the origin of tofu. ¬†Did you know that it was the military that gave us the most versatile food product? ¬†How awesome would it be if the brave soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan came home with something delicious that they invented?It's a great place to go with people if you'd like some level of control over your interaction with him/her/them. ¬†May secluded spots where you can make out, wide open spaces where you can yell at each other, and lots of plants, shrubs, ponds, etc., in between so you can get over it and later make up.Flowers are pretty, but after an hour or so, they start to look pretty much the same to my ignorant eyes, so I took more pictures of the architecture than the plants. ¬†The trunk of the tree ""born"" in the 1700s was awe-inspiring. ¬†The trolley was cool but would have been better with an entertaining and knowledgeable (not necessarily in that order) tour guide. ¬†Here's the Chinese garden, and there's the Japanese garden, so how come no Korean garden?"
"We visited here in the winter with our handy Museum pass. There are 10 greenhouses to tour (although one was closed getting ready for a butterfly exhibit). Overall I thought the collection was very nice, especially the bonzai area.But what really made this place shine is the lovely accomodating cashier. My husband and I had purchased the Montreal Museum pass the day before for $50 a piece. They get you into pretty much anything in the city. Well, my husband, managed to lose his. He ended up retracing our steps (in the bitter cold) only to end up empty-handed. So I used my pass and had my cash out for him. We mentioned our misfortune and the guy worked his magic and let my husband in for free saving us roughly $13. After thanking him profusely we walked through at a leisurely pace happy to see some green in the middle of winter."
"So sad we didn't have enough time (or energy) to explore more! It's a lot of walking and can get pretty tiring - just make sure to wear comfortable shoes. I'd also recommend reserving at least 2-3 hours to explore this expansive botanical garden, which is the second largest in the world. And yes, the Chinese Garden is beautiful. You really do feel as if you've been transported elsewhere."
"As a botanical garden, this place was quite lovely, but the main reason we stopped was because it was the last day of the Mosaicultures Internationalle and it didn't disappoint. ¬†Just check out the last page and change of the photos and you'll see why we decided that this was a must visit location when in town. ¬†I'm sure it's quite lovely all year round, but the topiary work that was on display was exceptionally innovative.And also note that admission purchased on-line was substantially less expensive than at the gate. ¬†You also get instant entry with a printed or digital display of the PDF ticket receipt."
"The Botanical Garden is a place I like to return to often and spend countless hours in relative silence.Check out the First Nations Garden, the gardens along Pie IX (section 6), the Chinese garden, Japanese garden and the Rose garden. Wander through their greenhouses and be amazed at the beauty of the collection.The setting is lovely and the plants, surprisingly, don't rush you around. There's no better place to release your inner misanthrope and spend some precious time in peace and the company of silent beautiful friends with fancy Latin names. When to visit: during the Lantern festival in October. Spend the afternoon wandering the gardens, then at nightfall stroll to the Chinese garden and see Chinese lantern art at its best.When not to visit: when it's still too soon after winter. I don't think anything gets going before mid-April at least."
"Very expansive set of gardens not far from the city center.Don't miss:- Senses garden (primarily meant for kids) invites you to touch and smell various plants.- Poisonous plant garden- Chinese garden (incredibly beautiful and has exhibits on Chinese crafts and snacks for sale!)This is a great place to be on a sunny day, but be prepared to do a lot of walking!"
"One of the very best botanical gardens I've ever seen. ¬†I love bonsai, and the collection here is superb. ¬†What a fabulous way to spend an afternoon in Montreal!"
"This is truly a beautiful garden to stop at, especially in summer. It displays a delightful Japanese Garden among many others. During various times of the year, you can also view special events such as a Butterfly Exhibit and Chinese Lantern Festival. The Buttterfly Exhibit is an enjoyable and rare experience to observe hundreds of species fluttering about in absolute glory and wander. It's particularly a photographer's paradise! Besides, if you have a full day at leisure, you can combine this visit with a trip to the Biodome right next door."
"This is a beautiful botanical garden. ¬†When we were here w/ friends several years ago there was a tram that took us around so we saw a lot more of it than we did yesterday because there was no tram. ¬†Last time we walked through the Chinese Garden and the Japanese Garden plus saw beautiful and interesting plants and trees from the tram. ¬†Yesterday we walked to and through the Chinese Garden, admiring the roses in bloom along the way. ¬†Currently there is a special annual lantern festival that will be open until the end of the month. ¬†This is its 19th year and it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Chinese Garden. ¬†The spectacle takes months to plan, w/ the plans being drawn up in Montreal and sent to Singapore, where the lanterns are fabricated. ¬†The completed lanterns are sent back to Montreal, where they are assembled, wired and put in place. ¬†The theme of this year's display is the reign of the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi and his cavalry, but there are also mythical, magical creatures like dragons amid the foliage. ¬†Lanterns are set up throughout the Chinese Garden, in the ponds and amongst the plants. ¬†The Botanical Garden stays open later, until 9PM, for the occasion and I would imagine the lanterns are even more impressive after dark than they were in the daylight. ¬†There are bilingual signs explaining the significance of the display and the items in it. ¬†The Garden itself is lovely and tranquil w/o the lanterns, w/ stone ""windows"" set in the walls looking out of the garden and walkways paved in intricate patterns of pebbles and stones. ¬†As we left the Chinese Garden I could smell the roses, even though they weren't visible from the gateway. ¬†There is much more to see than we saw this time but it is a beautiful garden that is worth several hours time, regardless of the season. ¬†Just wear comfortable walking shoes, take your camera and wear sunscreen."
"Close to the metro, so easy to access. Yesterday was at Jardin Botanique with my girlfriend for the Mosa√Øcultures. Honestly, that was special, very beautiful. I will be back next year. Tourists always like Jardin Botanique!"
"This is a beautiful garden. I wish I had known to enter through the greenhouse, see all of the inside and exhibit gardens (including the poisonous plant exhibit) and then wander over to the Chinese, Japanese and shade gardens. I only had three hours and I would have preferred to spend the majority of it on the exhibit side. The outdoor gardens are open to the public after 1800 without a fee, according to the garden's website. The lilac and stream garden area was absolutely stunning this week with many lilies blooming in profusion. The bromeliad hothouse area is very artistic and obviously crafted with a talented and loving eye/hand."
I really enjoyed my time there! If you haven't gone yet...I don't know what you are waiting for..
"I can be very careful with giving out 5 stars, too...but why don't people give this place 5?!?! ¬†It's spectacular! ¬†We had read and heard about it, but didn't necessarily plan to go. ¬†But, one day we were walking around the Olympic Stadium and saw it across the street. ¬†We asked a ""local"" about it and he told us that aside from being magnificent, it's free at night during the summer. ¬†So, we checked it out and were glad we did. ¬†We strolled for an hour or two, or however long before darkness set in. ¬†There's so much to see in this place and it's amazing not only how well taken care of all the gardens are...but how much work must go in to taking care of this place."
"We came on 9/29, the initially planned last day they held their International Mosaicultures exhibit. They apparently extended the exhibit for a week because it was so popular in demand. It drew crowds of outrageous proportions; I don't know how people physically stood on the snaking ticketing line in the blazing sun for hours (My group had pre-purchased tickets online and were able to go on the express line, waiting only 5 minues). Once inside the garden, it was very hard to walk around and enjoy the works of art when there were so many people (there was literally no elbow room). They were beautiful works, though. For this particular day's experience, I would give it 3 stars, but I know that in essence, the garden deserves more respect. We saw half of the Mosaicultures works because the crowds tired us out, and did not get to see the Gardens of Light exhibit due to fatigue (it would've been nicer to view after dusk, anyway). The park is huge, which is maybe why the [high] admission price is good for 2 days."
"I love coming here whenever I'm in Montreal. Several specialty gardens, including a Chinese and a Japanese garden, plus a large arboretum. Admission also allows you to visit the Insectarium. Check it out!"
"This is an amazing place to visit. It's so relaxing and there are several different themed gardens to stroll through. I visited in July and loved the Japanese and Chinese Gardens. The staff truly does a wonderful job preserving these gardens. I recommend purchasing a ticket package and visit the Biodome in the morning, which is walking distance from the Botanical Gardens, with very well-marked signs along the way. Great places to bring kids as well."
"Visiting the Botanical Gardens was one of the highlights of my Montreal trip this August. The Chinese Garden is absolutely beautiful and features gorgeous architecture, waterfalls, rock formations, and a live crane. I spent over an hour wandering in this garden alone. The rose garden is also exquisite as are the lotuses and the bonsais in the Japanese garden. Make sure you charge your camera battery! This place is great for taking pics. The indoor gardens are gorgeous too with lots of exotic orchids and other beautiful tropical flowers. The staff is helpful and unobtrusive. The grounds are well maintained and many areas have bathrooms available. My only complaint is that the gift shop is rather small and really did not offer much in terms of souvenirs. I was hoping for more magnets or pictures of flowers or the grounds, but there's not much here aside from a few keychains, knick-knacks and maple syrup and candies. This place is definitely worth a visit, just up from the Pie IX metro stop."
"We were told that it was amazing at night when they had the chinese garden lit up. I wouldn't know because we never got in. They had 3 cashiers for a line that stretched at from one end of the park to the other and out into the parking lot (easily 1/2 mile, maybe more). Apparently, they have this issue judging from what people in line were saying. They should get some temporary cashiers for really busy times when they know they are going to be slammed."
"I actually really liked this attraction! Definitely worth the money (though it wasn't cheap. Approximately $20 a person plus $12 for all day parking --- but they offer a CAA discount so ask about that if you have CAA membership). Beautifully maintained, open, clean, signage EVERYWHERE so you cannot get lost... there are activities for the young and old. Free trolleys that will shuttle you from one end of the park to the other if it's too far of a walk. Plants of every type and variety... I particularly enjoyed the edible and poisonous plants, and the insectarium was included with our admission. There are some disgusting bugs out there, but fantastic to view. You can tell they invested a lot of money into the park. We went earlier in the morning so it wasn't busy, by the time we left there was a long line to get in... by then it was quite hot so I would recommend going earlier to avoid lines/busy crowds/heat. Will go again! Beautiful."
"a beautiful place to stroll around for a few hours and soak in all the nature around you. i couldn't stop taking pictures of all the scenery! the chinese and japanese gardens were really nicely done, and my mother couldn't stop raving about how accurate they were (she's asian and a perfectionist). it's a great place to go, and it'll make you love montreal even more!"
"this place really disappointed me and my fiancee.. sure we came at the beginning of autumn.. but the gardens itself really left us wanting more since it was devoid of ""pretty flowers"".. the chinese gardens with the lanterns was nice though.. nevertheless.. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
"We visited the special exhibit - at first we were doubting paying $30 each (though good for two entries, we only had time for one) to walk through gardens, no matter how pretty - SO glad we did! Unbelievable topiaries in the special exhibit, and I mean unbelievably big, varied, historical, unbelievably creative and beautiful. They are sponsored by various associations within Canada and by other countries. The Chinese garden especially was also beautiful, peaceful, and interesting. Beautiful bonsai in the Japanese garden (and in the Chinese, but called something different there). We easily spent several hours walking the circuit. Many people seemed to be picnicking. If you are into gardening there is much more to explore. They have a garden devoted to vegetables, an alpine garden, and one devoted to new plants on the commercial home market. You can combine entries to the Biodome, Olympic Tower, and/or Insectarium - look online to figure it out before you wait on line, and in fact buy your tickets ahead of time so you don't need to wait (though the line moved okay, for us). We didn't have time for add-ons (but Biodome sounded great)."
"a sprawling garden with over 20,000 plants--check out the space-age ""Big O"" (""Big Owe""), Olympic Stadium, as well as the rest of the futuristic 1976 Olympics complex, while you're in the vicinity"
"This is a very cool park it combines all my favourite things : water activities, relaxation area, kids playgrounds and a soccer field. Yes this part is not perfect since it doesnt have a huge picnic area like La Fountine or free wifi like other parks but if you have kids thisis the place to be in the summer. A big water/splash area park and next to it a challenging playground devices to kill all that extra energy. Trully a small kids paradise."
"Wonderful neighbourhood park with a little something for everybody.Dog parks (one for large dogs, one for dogs under 20 lbs), TONS of green space for picnics or sunbathing or playing, huge play area for children including sprinklers for the hot days, sports field, etc.Unfortunately it does have lots of teenagers at night but the kids have to go somewhere, I guess. ¬† ¬†I love this place for walking my dogs, I'm there a LOT!"
"We've had a family membership for just over 2 yrs now and we're very happy at Midtown. The group classes are great -- Andre, Carole, Kostas are amazing (the rest as well, but they are our favourites). Some classes get fuller than others, but we've never felt over crowded. ¬†The tennis courts are fantastic. We love having access to indoor courts through the winter. They can be hard to book, specially during evenings and weekends, but we usually manage to find an opening. Leon and Francois are really great trainers. The summer camp for kids is excellent. They just renovated the showers in the ladies change room, and in general the facilities are clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. Jean Christophe at the front office has always been very approachable and accommodating.The cafe serves good food and smoothies, but -- and this is the one thing I dislike about the club -- the service is always really slow. Expect 30 mins for your food, even if you're the only ones eating. We usually just head elsewhere, but in the summer the terrace is very enjoyable (as long as you don't mind waiting to eat). The free indoor parking is also a plus."
"I tried this gym out to see if I wanted to sign up. I've heard positive things, but after visiting, I have no idea what the hype is about. MOLD under all the mats in the women's locker room. Walls falling apart. It was not easy to find the spa. The women's locker room is a maze. I tried the 60 mins massage and the masseuse talked half of the time. I couldn't relax at all. It was not an enjoyable experience. And for the price, no thank you. Will not be returning. Do not recommend."
"Midtown athletic club considered a prestigious club in Quebec. I have to agree with the fitness classes. Great spinning class! A must try. The weight training and tennis courts are a pleasure to use. However my review is mainly based on my experience with the cafe and good service. There is a beautiful out door area to have a bite and take a dip in the sauna. I don't know why a prestigious club would have dirt scum bobbles in the water. You just feel like running in to the shower after going in. Can't say it was a relaxin experience. Once I sat down out side for brunch, the menu was quite pricy but we are at A prestigious club and if you can afford the membership costs them paying 11.00 for two sunny side up eggs and a few fruits is fine. Now you'd expect great service right ? Wrong ! ¬†It took 40 min to get out order and the place was empty. Then once we finally got the meal. I can't say anything about the food itself. It was sunny side up eggs hard to mess that up and the fruits were fresh. The bread was multigrain, maybTu pense que j ai pas de peine moi? Que je n ai pas de sensibilit√© ? Pourtant tu commence a me connaitre et a savoir comme je suis une personne sensibele that why the meal was an extra 5.00 ;) Having been in the pool and wearing a bathing suit I asked for more coffee and when she poured it, she didn't both moving or taking the cup. ¬†She poured the coffee me , not a drop it was a lot! On my leg and foot. All I got was a bag of ice and the she avoided to come back to offer anything else. The kicker is I got the bill with out any compensation. Wow I have to say the service here stinks! You mess up you fix it! Poor service and hight price = fail"
"I like the women room with all comodities, sauna, bain vapeur and jacuzzi, plenty of towels and showers; the club is big so you have to walk a lot to make all tour ( tennis, yoga, spinning, restaurant, indoors and outdoor pool ! Enjoy if you can afford it."
"This is probably by far the worst gym in Montreal in terms of management, employees and overall atmosphere in this target high end gym ¬†People are patronizing and their restaurant service under the M Caf√© banner, is indeed a blatant example. In the same way as other comments made up to now, some of the staff are being treated as much as their ¬†second home and categorized members and labelled them. Outrageous. Fiercely competitive environment. Some trainers do no fit Since there's no such thing as perfection, this is named a 220,00 price tag. Among other things, looker rooms are getting tired ..."
"5/5 for the gym. Hands down the best gym in the city; quality equipment, clean, and not too busy. The free indoor parking is also a big plus, especially for winter. I like the fact that the weight room always has a trainer present to help you if you have any questions or looking for a spot. The Midtown is the most complete gym experience in Montreal.Concerning the Midtown Bistro/Restaurants, ¬†the food is average and the service is awful - but I don't blame them, who goes to a gym to eat. If you looking for gains and you about that life, dont eat a salad... there's a McDonald's a few blocks down."
"Best gym in the city ! Huge variety of classes and services Spa in location with mani, pedi , massage and other services Awesome staff! Very clean ! Nothing beats it ! Nothing like it in Montreal."
"Club staff is so rude, ¬†and provided no customer service at all. ¬†Beautiful club with horrible service. Very disappointed:(Not friendly to children, although selling family membership. ¬†Pool always not available for kids, only 3 hours per week. ¬†Daycare for kids never open, and workers there are not professionals, not safe... ¬†Don't leave your stuff, it will be stolen:(About food, had 2 times gastro, after eating there:("
"The management with Jean Beno√Æt and Fran√ßois Leduc was a catastrophe, very unfriendly, after 8 years going with all my family , paying vip lockers and a lot of extras, I decided to quite because the rudeness of the staff and the management, they just told me ok you can leave LOL very professional !!!! There is much better places in Montreal that they value customers."
Very nice gym with very rude staff! Kid running around in the summer time with no parental supervision under the staff's uncaring eye! Very unfortunate that this place has such mediocre management! Not worth the money!
"It's a nice gym but with a TERRIBLE service and staff! Couple of us tried to have lunch outside and we ended up serving ourselves. From running after a waiter who did not came once to our table within 30 min to getting our own utensils and after running again after him to pay?! Up front they have two large water pitchers which are never filled w water anyway! Once I tried to ask the personnel to fill it up only to get an absolute rude answer that she is super busy. (There was no one at the bar btw). I understand staff could get overwhelmed, but if you consider yourself as a 5 star sports club-HIRE MORE PEOPLE! Anytime I try to order something it's like asking them for a HUGE favor, sorry to remind you but this is what's called your JOB. And on top of it, any orders takes FOREVER. Trainers at the club are such a gossipers! How can you feel at ease and relaxed when you can't even discuss your personals. The guy who registered me did not tell me about available programs, discounts and available specials as a new member. So the moral of the review is that for the money they charge they are not worth being paid half."
"Je participe r√©guli√®rement aux rencontres Yulbiz. Celle d'hier avait lieu au Midtown Le Sporting Club Sanctuaire. L'√©tablissement est certainement appr√©ci√© par ses membres qui s'y entra√Ænent mais j'ai √©t√© d√©√ßu par la salle de r√©ception o√π avait lieu notre activit√©. L'√©clairage y √©tait assez sombre pour qu'un coll√®gue compare le lieu √† un salon fun√©raire. Par ailleurs, pour un lieu qui re√ßoit des gens d'affaires, j'ai trouv√© cela amateur de ne pouvoir uniquement payer comptant et sans remise d'une facture."
"Don't waste your time with this gym. There only concern is making a sale with your membership and lack any customer service. I just dropped my membership after the first month and wasted my time and money. Staff is extremely rude, have no interest in helping you and I never get answers to my questions. The food is horrible and I had my items stolen twice with no care or concern. There only care is to sell you membership then you never here from them again. Don't waste your time here or get fooled by there phony claims on there website. Your better off going some where else in the city where they look at you as a human being and not dollar amount. Way over priced, horrible staff, money hungry, below standard facilities and they refuse to correspond to you via email. Also not do not share any personal information with this gym including your phone number, address or personal email. They will gather this information to harass you to join without asking you !!! avoid at all cost !!"
"Ideal for cycling, skating and running! They have lockers, indoor tables and coffee machines."
"I have discovered a deep vein of neglected yelping here for myself as I seem to have neglected a bunch of my favourite parks! Fun fact about me, I didn't learn to ride a bike properly until I was in my 20s, and only then did I finally get out to really explore some of the incredible bike paths in our city, which have only been getting more and more exceptional in recent years. One awesome ride is to connect the big downtown parks, looping around from the mountain, laurier, la fontaine and then our here to Maisonneuve. Maisonneuve is realllllllly fun to bike, it's a great big green expanse with gorgeous paths, you really feel simultaneously so free and quite protected from cars and things - perfect if you're still gaining comfort as a biker. You can get up close and personal with that weird icon of architecture, the Big O, and there's stadiums tucked near by where you can watch some of the best Roller Derby bouts (when they reopen, le sigh!) If you're out enjoying the parks, just maintain that 2 meter safety zone and bring your mask and we can all help each other feel a little more safe in these bonkers times."
"This is the giant park next to the old olympic stuff. ¬†It looks like they took all of that area and decided to turn it into green space. ¬†The only problem with this area is the parking. ¬†There really isn't any free parking to enjoy the park. ¬†So end up having to pay for parking. ¬†But once you have, there is a LOT of space for you you to hike and enjoy the outdoors."
"It's a great place to go jogging, biking or rollerblading or just to enjoy a beautiful summer day. ¬†There are separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians which is smart although sometimes someone ends up on the path they shouldn't be on. ¬†Overall though I love this place."
"Giant green space, some riding trails. ¬†Great place to be during a hot summer day."
"Nice neighborhood park for kids. Will be better soon when renovations to the park (new building, re-done baseball field, and children's play pool) are complete. When will that happen? It's Montreal, so you're guess us as good as mine. Despite reno work, there are still nice community events occasionally. Examples: movies in the park at night, a P√©tanque charity tournament that's great fun for adult and kids, etc.One caution: the (plain looking) park immediately west of this one (no border between) is, I'm sad to say, a bit sketchy. I'll leave it at that. Hopefully that gets addressed."
"What a nice discovery driving along the quiet area nearby. Was looking for a small park to play soccer with the kiddo and I stumbled upon this gorgeous super park that has recently been renovated with a beautiful new play ground and splash pad. The kid loved it. The whole play area is so great and innovating!There is free and very accessible parking.Park Charbonneau is going to be a family favorite. Lots of place to play games, soccer and volleyball areas. Even a small mountain during winter! There's the option to have a picnic too! You can also go near the water and feed the ducks!"
"Such a fabulous family park! ¬†Great summer time free fun for the kids. There is something for everyone and it's enclosed so super safe. ¬†There's a small kids playground, bigger kids playground, water splash area, small soccer field. ¬†There's also two other areas that I'm not sure what it's used for. ¬†Lawn bowling but on tiny pebbles? ¬†Haha. Sorry...I'll have to research that one. ¬†For you loungers...plenty of picnic tables, benches, and green space. Dog lovers beware: ¬†No dogs allowed. The sign says there's a $300 fine if your dog is there. Not cool for animal lovers but I get it. Last thing you want is for your kid to roll in the grass right onto some dog poop."
"My son loves this place - but I suspect he'll outgrow it quickly. The play structures and water setup are new and nice. The soccer field - while equally new - is terribly maintained (grass is too long in some places while entirely missing in other areas - for huge patches).I wish the playground had a basketball or tennis court instead of the ""gravel field"" in the parc's SE corner. I've NEVER seen that spot being used... and don't know what it's for!"
"I've never reviewed a park but since I have a 4 year old I might as well start. This is a new park south of the canal. Here's how the scene goes:-Some scattered young kids, mostly unattended, some as young as 7 years old with no parent in sight.-Some locals sitting on benches chatting-A few random people having a snack on a picnic table-Some 20 something dudes playing hackey sack-Old retired people going for a walk through the park-People walking home from workSo, as you can see from what I described, the main attraction is not the play structures, it's just a small green space that locals use.There are 2 play structures (one for big kids and one for toddlers) and a splash pad however the big kids play structure is in full sun so the slides are generally too hot to use on a real hot day but the toddler slides have some shade.Really, this is a great spot for locals but not worth driving to if you are not in walking distance as the play structures and splash pads are pretty generic. But, if you do insist on driving here anyway, there is free street parking if you're willing to drive around a bit to find it."
"I'm at this park dozens of times every year - my son's high school is next to it so I'm there daily for drop off and pick up.What a large, gorgeous, relaxed park full of nice walkways. ¬† ¬†It's very well maintained, has a dog park, an indoor gym in the middle of it, a lovely large play area for young kids, tons of benches all over the place for sitting and just taking in a breeze.Bring a blanket and a book and enjoy an hour under a tree there ¬†:-)"
"No protection for those walking through the park! Ice everywhere! Terrible! No salted paths. I even slipped and have 3 fractures! 8 weeks in a cast! BAD! #MakeSidewalksSafeAgainIn other news, I like the dog park and other facilities this place has to offer. Just can't understand why they go through the time and money to make a skating rink but not take care of the crazy dangerous walkways to get to the rink itself."
"Lovely park with loads of space to enjoy a picnic,a stroll or a small bike ride. They have a dog park for puppies to frolic. Nice playground for kids to play & a splash pad for them to cool down in the summer. Well maintained soccer pitch as well.They officially have an indoor volleyball court & rumour has it that the coach works you hard to get your skills up to speed."
"Always a treat to be in this lovely leafy parc in Little Italy, whether its for a BBQ, or a Triple Crown picnic, or a chat with a friend on a quiet bench, or watching the dancing lessons in the gazebo on a summer evening, but it's most especially lovely when Pop Montreal rolls around and the gazebo becomes a stage for all kinds of bands from all over the world and there's cheap beer and burgers to be had and its the best. Like right now! Yay reviews from mobile!!"
"Pleasant little park near where the start of little Italy lies. There are many large older trees to catch some shade on a sunny day. The park is one of Montreal's gem urban spaces. In a city where the action never stops, the horns and sirens honk and blare it's important to have green space as a sense of sanctuary for the people to relax in nature and find peace whether it's to have kids run around, a picnic or just chill under a tree. For those that see people dining in the park with picnic baskets its a clever idea from Triple Crown dinette. I'm actually surprised no other restaurants in the area have caught onto the idea also. It's rather ingenious. Sometimes a few creepy characters hanging around but if you mind your P's and Q's they shouldn't bother you. Otherwise a great place to go and chill or relax in Spring-Summer or Fall."
"Beautiful park. They have a casino, which is really interesting seeing as this is a family-friendly park. They have La Ronde which is essentially a smaller Six Flags amusement park but with longer lineups, very expensive tickets, and small rides. Been to La Ronde before and I have no desire to go back because I have Canada's Wonderland back home and although Wonderland is crap as well, still a bit better than Montr√©al. The science dome is incredible! Reasonable price, and great for kids and adults alike who love to learn about engineering, the world and other fascinating parts of our lives. They also have Osheaga and countless other festivals so this park is jammed packed all summer long. Easy subway route so it is always a great time there."
"This is a really nice park. I guess is less of a park and more like a big empty lot where things happen. We came in for a free winter festival. There were food trucks, activities for the kids, ice sculpting, performances, games, ice skating... the works I guess. ¬†It was nice and cold and at times snowing, exactly what we came to Montreal from South Florida for!! I had a great time. The Biosphere is there as well. I didn't enjoy that as much, but got some great pictures. Further down from where we were was a fare of some sort with some slides and ice relates rides. Pretty cool. I also saw an amusement park on the other side, but it only opens in the summer.Overall a great place to spend a whole day with the family. Even pets are welcomed. I had a great time."
One of the best parks I visited in Montreal. It's huge and located in the middle of the St. Lawrence River. I was here for Heavy Montreal and I felt like I wanted to explore the entire park . The park has its own train station which is a plus for tourists!
Wonderful place to stroll in the late afternoon! Although there is construction going on it is still gorgeous! Saw beavers and different kinds of birds. There is also a bridge you can cross. Worth going and quick access via metro.
"Best parc ever. The beach is amazing. We had fun at the beach with our friends, our music and food. Really a relaxing place where you can enjoy your time. Kids were playing and swimming safely too. Best ever in Montreal."
"So it's a park- on an island. Wouldn't know it unless you looked at a map. Very cool. Lots of events going on including electronic music, food festival and a Brazilian theme party made this park the go to place! Getting here by train is easy. It's a busy weekend, so keep your kiddies close, be patient and have fun. I'm impressed. Clean bathrooms- bicycle ¬†rentals and lots of big trees to rest under."
"We were here specifically for a music festival, so we didn't get time to wander the trails, sit on benches, or otherwise meander through the park itself. Still, I feel like we saw enough of it to be duly impressed.To start, the park is pretty massive. I hadn't realized, going in, that it would be quite so spread out. We took the metro in to the park's station, and I saw a lot of kids on board. I thought to myself, ""Those are some rad parents, bringing their kids to a festival like this, introducing them to good music!"" But a lot of the kids ended up going to the other end of the park upon leaving the metro station, which I found amusing. Sure, there were some kids that were at the festival (more than I had expected), but the ones from our train on the metro walked in the opposite direction from the festival grounds.And the festival grounds, themselves, were massive as well. The festival had two main stages and two side stages, and they were spread out enough that you didn't have to worry about a band from one stage overpowering the band on the other stage (side stages, that is; they didn't have the two main stages going at the same time, of course).There were a ton of little shaded areas where people could kick back in the shade, and the festival organizers had spiffed those spaces up with hammocks and WiFi hotspots, which was a nice touch.The paths between the main and side stages were dirt and rock, but that was manageable. It got a bit dusty with all the people walking to and fro, but again, it wasn't terrible. There were small patches of grass and picnic tables near the main stages, as well, which were nice for those who needed a place to rest during the day. I know we didn't experience everything the park has to offer, but we were there for twelve hours that day, and did a lot of walking. We could see the Biodome from our spot near the main stages, and were able to enjoy a nice view of trees and lush surroundings from that vantage point, as well.I think the thing that impressed me the most is what I touched on at the top of this review: that the park was able to handle a large festival while still keeping part of it open for families and kids to enjoy, without the two being on top of each other, is impressive. I would have liked to have gone back to explore the non-festival part of the park, but our schedules didn't allow for that, alas. Maybe next time."
"Fete des Neiges! A winter festival, for winter lovers like we! It was a bit G rated, for two hedonistic adults, but we found a lot to be amused by, and wandered for several hours.Vin Chard - mulled wine in a cute commemorative travel mugTraineaux du Cheins - dogsledding!! All the pups are rescue dogs, and look very happy.Maple taffy made in snow!This was a fun wander. Kids doing crafts was hilarious - hacking at snow blocks with screwdrivers and rasps - having a blast. Kids playing hockey, and a general enjoyment of winter."
This park is literally the center of attraction in summer. International festivals are taking place over two weekends and Piknic Electronik is pumpin' every Sunday. Let us ¬†it ignore the winter events hosted there also. Perfect place for walkers or runners. While wandering you will run into a few sculptures just to make your route a little more interesting.
It was relaxing until you have to pay 14 bucks for 2 hours parking or 20$ a day. Where the world you have to pay for parking to go to the park!!!!! This french government fucking suck!!!!
"This is a beautiful and serene location. ¬†It's a park on an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence River. ¬†And, from this smaller, though not small, island (Ile Sainte-Helene), one looks across at the much bigger island that is the Ile de Montreal.The whole layout is interesting. ¬†First, it is accessed by car from ramps from the Pont Jacques-Cartier, as the bridge changes form from a cantilevered structure to a simple bridge structure on the other side of this island as it connects with the south shore. ¬†Then, the Metro also services this park. ¬†As it crosses the river from Montreal to the south shore, it makes one intermediate stop on the island and the station is called Jean-Drapeau.I have only seen it during autumn colors, and it is mostly quiet, but it is a must-see attraction in Montreal. ¬†There are views at its perimeter, ponds, ducks, squirrels, water features, grassy knolls, forested areas, and some structures such as an aquatic complex, the Biosphere, and an expensive restaurant called Helene de Champlain. ¬†Also, from the Jean-Drapeau metro stop on the island, one can easily walk to the Casino de Montreal, on adjacent Ile de Notre-Dame, or take a hop on a city bus line which continuously shuttles between this metro stop and the casino. (That 3 day STM pass works for all of these treks).Calling this island Parc Jean-Drapeau is interesting and maybe slightly amusing. ¬†It is a commemoration of Montreal's late spendthrift mayor who brought Expo 67, the Metro, and the Olympics to the city. ¬†Jean-Drapeau's mark is everywhere. ¬†He even had a sense of humor. ¬†When questioned about Toronto's upstaging Montreal as the economic engine of Canada, he said: ¬†""Let Toronto become Milan, we will always be Rome."" ¬†That made for a good belly laugh."
"MEGA OUTDOOR DANCE PARTY!!! =) came for PikNik Electronica ($12 admission)Okay, not JUST for that, but it's the perfect spot. It overlooks the river and out to old Montreal and is home to the Biosphere and botanical garden. When not for a major party, this park is superb for its quaint walkways, water paths, and great views. How do you spot this beauty? You'll see a funky structure that looks like an elongated alien spaceship landing on the ""harbor"". =PReally easy to get here.. just get off at the Jean - Drapeau on the yellow line. If you need a bike..BIXI rentals are just outside the train station! Wish Cali had a park like this!"
Parking cost $6.50/h everywhere. Bad management team has stolen this place from Montrealers. ¬†You want to go to the pool with young children? ¬†Or maybe want to take a walk in the weekend with the kids? ¬†You have to go by car because there is no way to bring tired kids back home by the metro. ¬†They literally have deserted the park because of the parking fees.
"Loved the swimming area, amazing! Terrific lane swim. Fabulous shallow section, really happy I went. Not cheap ($7), I would still return yearly, city is lucky to have this. Unique."
"I'm going to review this island based on the two half-marathons I've done this year. I've been to LaRonde in the past and its ok, but lets talk about the island. For running (in a race or just to run), its super scenic. Theres amazing views of the water, the city, trees and even some trails. I really enjoy it and the races I did there (one in February when it was -33 and one in April when it was 12 outside) were both really good even though the weather was completely different. I recommend coming here for a run for sure!Its also nice and clean. Theres music festivals that happen here in the summer but theres so many people its insane!"
This gorgeous park is beautifully landscaped. I was visiting for F1 but found myself wandering through the park enjoying the shade and the fountains and the flowers! Several very romantic spots to hideaway and have a picnic. From the signs it also seems like there is a significant boat rental area as well. I think I need to come back during a non-race weekend!
Not only is this park pretty awesome but they also have the F1 race over here. ¬†It's a pretty large park with lots to do but honestly I've been here mostly for F1!!!I don't think there's anything more cooler than walking the track after the race. ¬†Someday I'll have to enjoy the rest of the park but when wandering the park for F1 it's massive and there's all kinds of things around it.
"Cold... Snow....Ice.....Everywhere is frozen at Parc Jean-Drapeau when I visit.. but this is winter... a Canadian Winter...Slippery walkways... please be prepare and wear the right shoes or just hold on to your love ones and fall together.If you are in winter sports, there are a couple of trails for cross country skiing or snow shoeing. Snow Village also set up inside the park.Or if you are like me that are not good in any winter activities, come back when all these snow melt..."
"This place was a real pleasure to walk around. There wasn't much to do since it wasn't summertime but it was still beautiful to get some gorgeous views of the river and the city, especially since it's conveniently located on the Metro line. My biggest complaint would be that there aren't enough clearly delineated sidewalks or roads for pedestrians. We were basically walking in the road for much of our time there, trying to avoid cars. Since the Biosphere was closed (closes at 5pm), the main attraction was the casino which was more fun than I expected. It looked like kind of a happening Saturday night date place for middle aged couples. There's a bus that takes you straight to the casino right next to the metro station which I thought was really nice. My favorite part was taking pictures from the bridge that connects both the islands. Can't wait to come back in the summertime when all of the festivals and events which take place here are in full effect."
"A clean and pleasant park that overlooks Montreal's downtown. ¬†We were there on a Monday morning in October and hardly saw another soul. ¬†The pool looked green and unkept, wondering if anyone had used it in the last year. Overall, I can tell that the park is kept in great condition and the bathrooms were very clean."
"What came out to be a short visit to the biosphere, turned out to be a memorable and long visit in the parc du jean drapeau. The f√™tes des neiges was on going which caught my eye...it was like a winer wonderland full of amazing things that I've only seen in movies and tv shows back at home. From ziplining to snow tubing, ferries wheels, Ice sliding, ice skating, concert, ice sculptures and many more. I loved it so much here and there is so much to do here. Not only that, but there's a variety of food trucks and eateries to choose from throughout the park. I purchased the acropass which I think is the best imaginable deal I've encountered in my lifetime!!! $16 for 4 weekends and unlimited access to on park amenities, rides, food discounts and free access to the biosphere and the museum in the outskirts if the island. I enjoyed myself so much with the snowtubing (1st time) took great pictures. The museum which is an old fort was awe inspiring and educational. I came here last Saturday and ended up back the following day :) I wish nyc had awesome festivals like this one. I highly recommend going to this for any visitors of the upcoming weekend. I believe it's the last one. Also now I have a little buddy hanging by my coats collar as memory...fyi the acropass is a souvenir polar bear..now that's awesome!!"
I came here for the Grand Prix and had a fantastic time. ¬†Another off season joy is that PJD is a wonderful place to come on the weekend when you want some solace and a quiet place to relax (just make sure no racing is scheduled). ¬†It's very accessible from the metro and easy to get in and out.
"Oh yes, this place brings back memories. Parc Jean-Drapeau is located on a beautiful little island on the St Lawrence River. You can get here using the metro or over the bridge. The thing I like most about Parc Jean-Drapeau is that it's one of the best running routes I've ever went on (and I've been to a few). The run there and back (to the city) is around a good 15km, but you get to see the beautiful river, the park, and all the industrial stuff on the south side too. I've been on this run several dozen times and I have just touched the surface of its beauty. Right next to the park is a race track. I haven't been there for any racing events, but I heard it get pretty crazy when there's a race. This is also where they host PikNik Electronic (during the summer). Never been there myself, but I heard it's pretty rad."
"I can't help but describe this as the Canadian twin to New York's own Flushing Meadows - Corona Park. and I mean that in a good way!both were developed for a World's Fair (Expo 67, just 3 years after NYC's), are a short walk from a subway line, are fairly well-maintained, and host to all sorts of events and activities that go above and beyond their original purpose.are you a history buff? go to the Stewart Museum.want to burn some calories off your fat ass after eating too much poutine? go swimming, hiking, biking, and more.like environmental sciences? visit the Biosphere.music fan? see a concert here. in fact, they were setting up for the Heavy MTL festival when we walked past (kinda wish I had gotten tickets but they were sold out by then) the outdoor concert field. Iron Maiden and Metallica have both played here -FUC yeah!into amusement parks? La Ronde (owned by Six Flags) is right there.this is a great park with something for everyone and kinda makes you forget you are in the hustle and bustle of a city!"
"The park itself is really nice has a great vibe. If you're trying to get to the beach, the signs don't point your way. If you know you're heading to Notre Dame island, then you've got a leg up, since there are no specific directions how to get to the beach, only the island.If you're staying in the parc, then everything is fine. But not so much if you want to go somewhere specific"
"Had a great time here for F1!The grounds are great, and it's really easy to get to by Metro or Bixi (in the Summer).While I spent most of my time at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve watching cars go really really (really!) fast, walking around the park was nice, and I will definitely be back."
"Ah, Parc Jean Drapeau, the memories...When just dating my hubby, we'd spend an hour everyday after work walking and talking, getting to know each other at this park.The beautiful trails, the vast places to sit and relax and all the events that occur there it's just a great Montreal landmark and for good reason.When you want to have a nice day outdoors and not leave the island just head out there and enjoy."
Music is cool. ¬†Live bands are fun. ¬†Summer concerts are nice. ¬†Once thing I've learned is life is more fun when you raise the stakes. ¬†If one wants to watch a concert on a tiny island (easily accessible by the Metro) on the Saint Lawrence where the backdrop is the cityscape of Centre-Ville (Downtown Montreal) then this is your spot. ¬†And this spot is legend. ¬†I caught Radiohead here do what they do best in 2003. ¬†It was one of the more majestic experiences of my life. ¬†This experience was nearly marred by a skanky pre-packaged Quebecois ham sandwich which featured some rotten mayo. ¬†Good thing that tragedy didn't kick in until after the concert at the club. ¬†I puked about eight times that night at Stereo. ¬†It was still an outstanding night.I want to go back to Parc Jean-Drapeau._C$
"Simply amazing venue! HUGE outdoor park area, incredibly beautiful, long gorgeous paths that snake around a lake and trees and nature and all that great outside stuff. I played the last show of the 2006 Warped Tour here. The only downside of that day was that our bus had to park literally a mile from the stage and it was mostly a gravel path. I had to make six trips total to get all my gear to the stage and back. But it was well worth it, biggest crowd of the tour and one of the most profitable days. There were well over 5,000 kids watching us that day. Hella mega tits!youtube.com/watch?v=lFeq‚Ä¶"
Have visited the last 2 years for Heavy MTL....amazing place for a slew of great Metal Bands ...his festival is a must go to at the park. A gathering of 20 or so amazing metal music . There are a ton of ¬†food vendors on site but with the amount of people expect long lines at them. The atmosphere is awesome with a gathering of many differnt types of metal fans. Great place.
"Lovely, scenic park that transformed nicely into a music festival venue. It was great to be out in nature, among dense trees and water, listening to musicians play their hearts out. Great, sprawling space."
"The more and more I visit this park, the more and more I enjoy it. I've been here quite a bit just to use the pool. Recently this summer I biked from Verdun to PJD (Parc Jean-Drapeau), and it was quite a nice ride. I also participated in the Light the Night Walk a couple weekends ago, and it was a really nice walk. There is so much to discover in this park, I look forward to exploring PJD some more."
"A cool park to checkout. Don't bother with Notre Dame, the second island. If you want to sight see, you can probably run through many things in a hour. However, on a nice day, you can certainly spend time laying, walking in the stream, or walkint through the trees. Not sure about admission."
"Park comprised of √éle Ste-H√©l√®ne and √éle Notre-Dame--check out the remains of Expo 67, as well as the last vestiges of Montreal's past as a garrison city--have a picnic--take in some beautiful views of the city--don't miss the beautifully anachronistic Moorish towers that grace the entrance to the park from the Jacques-Cartier Bridge"
"This is a cool park to checkout. If you're walking, don't bother with Notre Dame, the second island. If you want to sight see, you can probably run through what's worth seeing in a hour. However, on a nice day, you can certainly spend time laying, wadding in the stream, or strolling through the trees. We also saw what looked like a nice pool. Not sure about admission, since we were not looking to go in."
"This was such a cool find for us on our ¬†vacation to Montreal. I was so impressed with the amount of things to do in this park! We brought our skates and made a few trips around the race track, which was way cool. Who knew you could skate or bike or run on the same course as the Formula 1 cars? ¬†Going back today for the beach, this time riding our bikes to the island across the bridge, and will go back again for La Ronde, and probably once more for the Biosphere. I'm glad our condo is at the foot of the bridge!"
"The park is very beautiful, I especially like the events of F√™te des neiges et F√™te des anfants. My families visit these festivals every year, but since 2012, the F√™te des anfants is canceled, that is the reason why I can not give this park five stars."
"It was a sunny day and I was in the mood for a little urban exploration, so during my lunch break, I ended up near the Promenade Bonaventure. I first noticed the amazing structures which looked like trees, you can climb on them and get a different perspective of the neighborhood. ¬†Then as I kept on walking along the long path, I've noticed the play area for kids as well as a few coworkers (I guess) enjoying a game of ping pong on the permanent tables, there's also a trek fit space for outdoor training, lounge chairs as well as picnic tables and at the end, the amazing sculpture, Source, which was created for Montr√©al's 375th anniversary.Although I enjoyed my walk, I must say that as this park is replacing a former expressway, I could not avoid the car waltz and all that it implies, moreover, the trees of the Promenade Bonaventure being very young, it was impossible to find a point of shade by this sunny day."
"Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood is putting a lot of effort into making the lives of its residents a pleasant one, Morgan Park is one of those improvements, and honestly, what's not to like about that place? The beautiful fountain at the entrance, the landscaping, the two playgrounds for kids, the exercise trail, the numerous restaurants surrounding the area (location, location! Chez Bouffe is located a few steps away) as well as the two water games areas linked by a stream. Yep, this family-friendly park is definitely one of my favorites in Montreal."
"This is one of my favourite spots in the greater Montreal area. What a treasure! On a nice Fall, Spring, or Summer day... it is paradise. I live in Pointe-Saint-Charles and love waking up early (6am) to bike along the Canal Lachine until I reach this destination. For me, the best feeling is arriving in the empty park and joining the birds as they do their morning chirping thing. What a privilege!! I always stop at the West-most point of the park to sit on a park bench, eat a banana, and watch the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. On a calm, quiet, and clear morning this is perfection. I usually take the opportunity to think about something while I do this and then often feel the need to get back on the move after 10-15 minutes (so I'm still waiting for my epiphany of thought during these sessions). Anyway, my real point is this: Parc Rene-Levesque is a wonderful investment of time into happiness. A little time (10-15 minutes) really helps me win my day. I am so grateful that we all have access to this precious public resource.To give a sense of proportion: Lachine is on of the very few areas outside of my beloved Pointe-Saint-Charles neighbourhood that I've thought of moving to. This park is a main driver of this consideration."
"I have very mixed feelings about this place. Let me explain.The park is massive. No complaints here. Tons of room to walk, rest and have a nice picnic. You'll find, along the way, nice sculptures representing different things. Along the way is a nice dock you can walk on and be close to the water on the Canal. This good stuff pretty much stops here. The park, and I mean all of it (look on google maps for the entire size), is filled with dog poop. I mean everywhere. Take one step and you've stepped in some, take another step and... low and behold you've stepped in some more again.I am not kidding. The park is not clean and I was disgusted by this that I did not want to sit on the ground to have my picnic. Thank god we found a bench because there was absolutely no way I'd be able to sit and eat.My reasoning for the two stars is that if you expect people to come to a public park, at least clean it.I understand if there was dog poop here and there but literally everywhere? I mean c'mon Parc Ren√©-L√©vesque. Time to step up and clean the poopsies!"
A really nice park to walk through with a gorgeous view of the water. One of the more scenic parks around Montreal at the tip of the Lachine Canal.
"Park Ren√©-L√©vesque is simply gorgeous. It's basically a strip of land that stretches right into Saint Lawrence river and lake Saint Luis. The views of the surrounding water are breathtaking in all seasons particularly from the west tip of the park. Big highlight of the park is the sculpture garden. There is also an arboretum section to enjoy. Best of all is the park is accessible by many biking paths. However if you prefer to come for a picnic with many friends, family, bringing cooler and barbecue grill you will find a lot of paid parking space at the park entrance. One of the places I would also strongly recommend to bring Montreal visitors to."
"Please don't hate me because I'm from Montreal, live downtown, am an avid biker and never knew about this Park. I discovered ¬†it today and what a Gem this is. It's what we call a Peninsula in Lachine. On one side we see all the boats and on the other the horizon. I fumbled on to this riding through Verdun to Lasalle to Lachine. It's a small stretch through the park about 300m but it's full of families playing, outdoor beautiful sculptures or benches to sit on and just take a deep breath and look out in the yonder..... What a great day it was!"
"It astounds me that there are people in Montreal who have lived here for years and have no idea or clue about Montreal's southern shoreline and how it's basically one long, 20 km non-stop park (and bicycle path) from the Champlain Bridge right through Verdun, Lasalle and to the end of Lachine/beginning of Dorval. (Seriously Plateau yuppies and Mile End hipsters, get out of your shells sometime...) Parc Rene Levesque is one of the more special ones, in that it is a peninsula created from landfill (like ¬†Ile Ste-Helene and Parc Jean Drapeau), but the landscape artists did a super job making the sculptures and the waterfront views the highlights of this peninsula park. On one side, it faces Kahnawake and on the other side, it faces the old Lachine village, the Lachine marina and the beginning of the Lachine Canal. This place is always filled with roller-bladers, cyclists and families out enjoying the day. Not sure if it's still going, but there used to be a ferry that ran between the tip of the park to the Lachine Village (in front of the Dairy Queen).I find Montreal, while it has its share of sculptured public art, comes no where near as close the amounts of public sculptures and statues you see in cities like New York, Toronto or even Chicago. Come here, and it makes up for what it lacks downtown if you like sculptured art. In fact all the waterfront parks along Lachine are full of them."
"HIDDEN MONTREAL PARK GEM and next to Mont-Royal our favorite number 2 park for walking, skating, runninh or biking.Park shoots out on a peninsula with water on both sides and one of the largest outdoor sculpture exhibits in canada and beautifully kept large green lawn areas and waterside recliners and benches.Park is not huge but it is a great peaceful, breezy and well maintained setting for a nice walk and picnic and a great bench seating area at the end of the peninsula with the cool water breezes and water all around.At the beginning of the park on right side you will find a sign with map and list of the 30 outdoor sculptures and their artists. Before you read the artists background and description try to get the group to determine what they thought the artist inspiration or influences were in making these sculptures.There is also a great cafe bistro with lots of seating area and terrace at the start of the park.A must stop for all: locals and visitors"
This is a medium size park (I would say a strip of 2 Km on 200-300m) but full of wonders. The park is a small Peninsula which means you can walk on the trail and on one side see boats and the other the horizon. At the entrance there is a small shop you can rent bikes or skates or just buy some icecream. This is your last chance for some cold drinks if you didnt bring any with you.What gives this park some extra points is all the wonderful statues that are scattered all over. My son just loved exploring them. Most of the park is exposed to the sun but there are trees and benches you can sit on or picnic in the shade. also in the edge of the park there is a small strip you can actually go into the water (if you are brave).
"GORGEOUS park. One of my favorite parks, if not my favorite. Such an easy park to stroll through as it is spread along the water. Unlike other parks, there are no cliffs to hike up and it probably holds the most outdoor sculptures. Just wish it was closer to my place downtown. FYI, no dogs allowed. Having traveled all the way there, I was lucky to have a carrier bag for my little furry friend to carry him around unnoticed. - The end."
"Absolutely LOVED this parc. It's soo beautiful. It's the end of the Canal Lachine Bike route. and there's so many birds/ducks that don't get scared of you, places to sit, restrooms if you need it, and just an amazing view. It's really good to relax, have your picnic, enjoy ypur food, chill, tan, anything basically! I'd come back here again, and it's a nice break after the long long bike ride!"
"Cannot believe that me, someone who reviews like every park ever...has NOT reviewed this park yet?!¬† This is but one of a few serious head scratchers I've come across recently. We're fixin that right now.So this park is technically actually ginormous and constitutes the whole entire LaSalle Blvd riverside park from the Verdun border (Parc l'Honorable Georges O'Reilly) all the way to Parc de l'Aqueduc. I've tried numerous times, to no avail, to find some other hidden park name throughout this vast space, but so far nada. Particularly though, the spot you really wana check out in this park, and the reason it deserves more than all 5 stars, is the bird sanctuary island: at the corner of 6th/7th avenue and Blvd LaSalle. The rapids are intimidatingly astonishing and close enough to drown in here and the whole tiny island is full of different birds and sometimes other wildlife. Great picnic options, great photo options, extremely relaxing, beautiful and enjoyable! Bikes are not permitted on the island and must be parked at the bike rack at the entrance, so bring your bike lock. (There are still A-HOLES that don't respect this and think it's fine to walk their bikes through, but please don't be like those ppl - you'll disturb the bird habitats and make it difficult to walk around each other on the path as well as cause traffic). It's a beautiful spot to bird watch, practice photography, do yoga, picnic or to enjoy the rapids in all their glory without getting wet (necessarily). It's an excellent, well worth the price tag of ZERO, activity for the whole family or the couple in love to enjoy.Up until recently dogs were not allowed in any part of this park, now pooches are allowed in the park by the riverside, but still not allowed to bring your furchildren with you on the sanctuary island at 6th avenue (for obvious reasons). I have taken many many photos at my stops at this park so let them speak for me. I will leave it at this: if u live in Mtl, or if ur visiting Mtl and you believe Parc Lafontaine etc. is impressive or worth your time, and you have not yet discovered this park: it is DEFINITELY worth making the trek over, you have definitely been missin out on somethin' special.Of course I say that knowing one day I'll be b*tching that the spot got too popular and ppl are ruining it. *le sigh* Enjoy with respect folks okodoki?!"
Just past my fav park I found this lovely park that was full of wild animals. I seen a crane a ground hog ducks and birds all with in 3 minutes.Great place to go for a walk or even have a picnic.The rapids are intense as ever here so be careful.
"IMPORTANT FOR DOG OWNERS: Ok park, but Not Pet Friendly at All. They do not even allow small dogs in backpacks or other carriers."
"This is Montreal's ""other"" Park.While many have already written about and described and visited Montreal's Mont Royal Park, I'd like to divert people's attention to another of Montreal's park's and the better one in my opinion as well.The Parc des Rapides is located in the southern Montreal borough of Lasalle and without a car, it's not all that difficult to get to. Just go to De L'Eglise Metro station (Green Line) and catch the 58 ouest. Better yet, jump on the Verdun bike path which runs along the river and it will literally take you there.A giant bird sanctuary, thunderous, roaring river rapids, adventurous kayakers, Stand-Up Paddling in the basin, fly-fishing, families out for the day, photographers, couples making out in the bushes, students studying under a shade of the tree, painters, random landscape sculptures, you will literally find it all here. I actually prefer this park to Mont Royal because of the dramatic setting in the middle of the St. Lawrence River and the crashing white water rapids all around you. It just somehow feels cooler and you feel you're nowhere near the city. The landscape designers have done a stellar job here of interspersing the trees, bushes, flowers, and sculptures. You're bound to find your own little place somewhere here to just chill, pic-nic, read a book or meditate. Pack a lunch and come here and if you didn't, no worries, there's a great Italian restaurant across the street as well as an ice-cream bar. Come here, chill, relax, watch the ducks, geese, herons and other birds. Montreal may be one of the unique cities in the world which is located close-by to white river rapids so ¬†why not come check it out? This is a wonderful place which not many outsiders know about but should and deserves more attention from locals and visitors alike."
A great FREE attraction which is also located in a reasonable distance from a metro so thats another plus. The nice park (or parc) is at the edge of a lovely canal walk and what I like about it is that during the summer you see people there enjoying the sun and during winter you can come there and see huge chunks of ice floating on the river..breathtaking.
"I come here a lot and it just occurred to me to review it.It's a nice island, It looks beautiful in the summer and they have lots of parks and bike paths. A great place to have a picnic or go to the pool.Walking around is always pleasant and towards the end of the island there's a nice workout spot next to Saint Lawrence River. I really enjoy going to Mamie Clafoutis bakery and Sushi Palace.However, there are lots of mosquitoes and it is quite far away. The only public transportation that will take you there is quite unreliable. In the winter time, it's not somewhere you would go unless you lived there."
"I HAVE experienced better islands, ok? I thought about giving this island 3 stars, because there are some very cute and affordable little bungalows on it, and a winding little river with willow trees, and moments of feeling like this would be a nice place to be a kid, but let's face it, now it's mostly condos that ate the shoreline and demolished what should have been protected habitats for all kinds of endangered birds. These were wetlands basically, and now this is just another network of roads linking another pile of mini strip malls, and glass spiked office buildings, and depressing boxlike housing where we can stash our elderly and a few young families looking for affordable housing and last I checked they don't even have recycling pickup."
"Nun's Island is one of the best residential areas in Montreal. There is a lot of green space, community parks, walking paths along Saint Laurence river with memorable views. There are also well maintained sport facilities and community center. The island is 10 min away from downtown, the Old Port of Montreal and Atwater market. There are biking paths that connect the island to Ile Sainte Helene through the ice braking bridge running along Champlain Bridge, as well as biking paths going to Lachine cannal.Snow cleaning and collection during the winter is well organized and may be one of the best in Montreal (difficult to compete with Westmount).Best part is kids play on my street during every season. Cons: growing property prices, over construction in some areas, lack of second primary school the borough of Verdun still can't figure out the right location for. ¬† ¬†P.S. There is a recycling pickup since I moved in some time ago....."
"Well this is not the traditional children's playground that our little one normally goes to. ¬†Out of all the playground we have been to, this one is undeniably the coolest. We went early in the morning, but can assure you that this place gets busy very fast. The principal attraction is the zipline, which makes this park truly unique. ¬†Make your way to the treehouse, going on the suspended bridges, spider webs and ladders. Lots of other features to ensure that kids of all ages will not get bored, and plenty of places to sit or even have a bite to eat. Very well designed and plenty of space. Just be mindful to stay off areas where there are warning signs about poison ivy."
"The ""Centre de la Nature"" is Laval's park. It's HUGE! Here's a rundown :Pros :- If you have kids, this is a great place to bring them to. There are so many things they can do and it can make for a great family outing.- There's a free animal farm with lots of animals to see such as goats, horses, cows, chickens, roosters, pigs, ponies, mules and so forth. They look like they are taken care of well enough and kids and adult both like to see them.- There's a casse-croute/fast-food joint near the lake. They serve a variety of fast food items such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pogos, fries and so forth. Their menu also has a few more things that clearly caters to kids as well as unprepared parents. :)- Lake has lots of activities. During the summer, canoes can be rented, during the winter you can go skating on the lake.- Plenty of places to plop down onto the grass and have a family picnic.- Lots of trails to be enjoyed and some parts are particularly enjoyable. There's a reason why this place is well known for wedding photos and seeing more than your fair share of brides and grooms walking around.- Huge play park for kids in front of the Farm. Lots of kids here and it can be pretty chaotic... but that's how kids like it, right? :)Cons :- If you're not so much into kids, you may want to avoid some areas during the weekends, there are really A LOT of kids. Some areas may be quiet enough to be enjoyed however if you look well enough.- While their casse-croute/fast food joint has nothing that truly stands out, kindly note the wait time is pretty bad. 20+ minutes to prepare me a couple of hot dogs, pogos and fries? Sup?- Parking is 7$. While contributing to the park is nice and all, it's a bit expensive. So, if you're able to park somewhere nearby freely on the residential streets and bring your stuff to the park, you'll save a bit. You are planning to do a lot of walking anyways, right? What's 10 minutes more going to do?"
"During covid-19, water equipment rental not available and playground section is surrounded by tall metal fences. There is a hand washing station before going into the play area and watched by 2 people. We went for an evening picnic with friends by the water. Parc is very well maintained with beautiful flowers and decoration and can still see some of the farm animals."
"My friend and I came here to ice skate. The skating area was quite vast and on a frozen lake. There was music playing, a maple syrup shack, and a fire pit. Food is available in the main building and entrance is free! I read in some reviews that there was paid parking, but I didn't see that. We parked for free. What a great place!"
"Probably the biggest park I have seen right in a metropolitan city like Laval and this place is huge with 4 lots of parking spaces (7$/day) and plenty of activities to do. There is a building where people can rest and go to the restrooms. There was a hockey tournament going on last weekend, kids join in the fun to win a look-alike Stanley cup. There were free hot dogs stand and free hot drinks from Tim Hortons. I didn't really get a chance to see around because it was way too cold to just walk around to look but I see a board where they specify they offer boat activities, hiking, and biking path. Pretty excited to see how this place looks like in the summer. The snow does not do justice to this amazing park!"
Can't count the number of times I've been there and the number of pics I've taken there and the number of family members from out of town or out of the country I've gone with there! Even as a Montrealer it's a must to go there! And bonus there are bathrooms to go to!!! Must go back ASAP! Go you won't regret it
"AMAZING PARK! abundant parking both with the park and also regular street parking outside. ¬†free entrance and you only pay for what you want to do (paddle boat, canoe, kayak, poney ride, train ride), a super neat park with piano and xylophone, there's a small farm and a petting area, a lake and tons of grass area for kids to play and families to picnic on. really fun place for kids and optimal for parents. i've heard complaints that it can get packed and i can see why considering how family friendly (and cheap!) this place is so i'd recommend going in the morning! our family had a blast, will definitely be regular visitors this summer."
"I just love, love, LOVE this park. We came here during the Christmas market with the family and had an amazing time. Bought so many home made chocolates, artisan breads, drank some nice hot chocolate and my son met Santa and was trolled by an elf LOL.During the summer it is a great place to have a picnic and just enjoy the beauty of the park and its' animals.Did I mention how much I LOVE this place!"
"Went to Montreal and or course we needed to visit the Old Port of Montreal, every time we go we stop at Montreal we always come. It's our first time coming since¬† La Grande Roue de Montreal was built. It is a great attraction, and there's something of interest for the whole family which is great. You can walk and sit along the old port and look at the beautiful views that stretches over 2km along the Saint Lawrence River.¬†We also love the street vendors, good prices and unique stuff. Everyone was interested in what the vendors had to offer, they were very friendly as well. They also had food trucks."
Beautiful old port that is kind or touristy but we were tourists so it worked. Helps if there is great weather and sunny skies as the view across the river is lovely with lots of Canadian Geese swimming about. Great picture spot especially in fall with all the colorful leaves. Some food trucks and some vendors there as well. Perfect for a picnic in the summer.
"I love the old port, it always makes me feel like a kid again, beautiful views, historic sites. I was bored and told myself, you haven't been downtown in such a long time, so I decided to go to the old port. I went to the clock tower where I decided to go all the way up on too, approximately 281 steps, going up was not so bad, but coming that was a whole other story. But if you do try bring your camera as there is exceptional views from up there.Great restaurant, always many street players, they also have la Grande Roue now which is open even during winter. In the summer you can swing you way over the old port. Many activities for all age. What I like about the old port is that its for all ages all occasion form you young couple, to a family with many kids and good in every season."
"Loved visiting the Old Port! So much to do including the Ferris wheel, shopping and zip-lining. Highly recommend, would visit again!"
"I'm not entirely sure what's so different about this Yelp listing and the one for Old Montreal, as the lines seem to blur. So I'm not going to wax too poetic here, just in case I'm describing the same thing as that other Yelp page without the word ""port"" in it.But that's the main different to me, is that this is all about that port, and even though all of old Montreal sort of has the moniker of ""Old Port"" that we're dealing with the port part specifically.To be honest, it's still the tale of two ports. Yes, there's the area with all the trinket stands, and the massive aerial playground and the zipline and the paddleboats and the droves of tourists. But I was just wandering around and had the other area of the port with locals walking dogs, jogging, and some really incredibly lovely park-like bits near the water, with ponds, fountains, ducks, walkways, and wonderful flowers.I stood there and looked out across the water and saw the funky architecture, and I watched a boat take off into the river, and it felt like a very port-y experience so separate from the commercial side. But really, both were so fun, each in their own way, and without both I would probably not have deeply appreciated either."
"I like visiting Le Vieux-Port de Montreal everytime we come to this breathtaking city. ¬†The Old Port is part of Old Montreal. ¬†It is over 2 Kilometers long, and it faces the St. Lawrence River.There are plenty of sights to admire. ¬†The most popular are the Science Center, IMAX, and the Clock Tower. ¬†Pretty soon, Montreal will have their own version of the London Eye up and running. ¬†Yup, its the one that looks like a giant ferris wheel. ¬†There are lots of places to eat in the area. ¬†Saw cafes, restaurants, and even a bunch of food trucks. ¬†Like shopping? ¬†There are many vendors selling their merchandise.To me the best part of Old Port Montreal, is to simply go there for a stroll. ¬†Find a spot to sit and chillax. ¬†Maybe even have a picnic too.There are so many things to love about Montreal, and the Old Port happens to be one of them."
"A bit under whelmed. Maybe because it was a gray day. Everything seemed so gray. There was a very large empty concrete surface area in the middle seemingly serving no purpose. All food vendor trucks and carts were shut down. There is a big wheel you can go up in, not quite the London eye though."
"Is there ever a bad day at a marina? ¬†Touristy yet still cool check out of marinas and view from the port to old city.It's not a working port but more as a marina and short tours. ¬†I love looking at boats almost more than cars, so all was good. ¬†Options for all ages but is mostly touristy."
"Put your tourist tennis shoes on and get ready to stroll.We enjoyed our varied walks through Old Port while visiting Montreal. ¬†There are parks, paths, boats, paddle boats, zip line, museums, food... You can find almost anything to do or nothing to do. ¬†We never found it overly packed but it was busy (if that makes sense). ¬†We didn't even get to all the spots! ¬†Enjoy your stroll along the St. Lawrence river."
"Summer time Saturday night packed a la max. It's crazy the amount of people filling up the streets, it's almost overwhelming. I love the old port the buildings are beautiful and there's so many neat little restos that I wouldn't usually go to because it's a bit further. Parking there is really hectic good luck to anybody trying to find a spot, my advice to you ditch the car take the metro or a uber.The best part of the old port is the cobble stone they have so many great little streets you can walk down and feel like you're in a little city in Europe. The fireworks are the main attraction I would say and they go off at 10 pm sharp so if you want a great spot go early, personally I always find a great spot away from the crowd and always have a great view. Try to find spots that have a little foot bridge or parking levels that are higher up."
"I absolutely love ports and this one was filled with food trucks/stands - it was SO ALIVE which made me veryyy happy. honestly i can just sit here and just people watch while eating from the food trucks all day but due to the parking situation here (only st parking is available and it's all metered so you can only pay for a certain amount of time) i had to run out right after buying my food. overall, definitely recommend people coming here if they come visit montreal, definitely one of my favorite areas"
"Definitely a must do while in Montreal! There is a lot to see, eat, and do! Start off with some of the local cuisine (poutine!) in the food trucks. There is also usually a little arts festival along the port as well. If you have young kids, there is a little train that takes you around, bounce houses, bikes, carts, and paddle boats! So much fun!! There is also a zip line and high ropes course for the thrill seekers! The only downside to the port is the abundance of aggressive seagulls and bees! I have a little 10 month old and I was constantly swatting them away!"
"Most picturesque place in Montreal. A myriad of restaurants to choose from, eventful all year long, great atmosphere for families and hanging out with friends. Although known as one of Montreal's touristic spots, it is also frequented by locals, so you won't be getting a fake, touristy experience, you will be living it like a true montrealer."
"Vieux-Port (Old Port) is a hot tourist spot like Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Navy Pier in Chicago, and South Street Seaport in NYC. ¬†Out of all of the above, Old Port is my favorite. ¬†1. ¬†They have ziplining!2. ¬†There is a SOS labyrinth game in a converted warehouse!3. ¬†There is an adorable little kiddy train for young children and their parents.4. ¬†It's located along Old Montreal and maintains its historic vibe.5. ¬†The vendors along the pier are not aggressive in selling you their items."
"The Old Port is definitely turning Into the SF version of Fishermans wharf. Unfortunately every city does have it's must visit places. Many tour guides and hotel concierges must send tourists here in droves. It's a place to see some of the oldest part of Montreal. This is the main draw. The cobblestone streets are unlike many other places you see in a canada (other than Quebec City). ¬† The place however is becoming more and more tacky with horse and carriage tour people all over and your typical nick knack tourist shops. I guess it's the inevitability of having demand for lots of foot traffic. There are some wonderful historic places. You can learn about the early history of Montreal and marvel in the old buildings. ¬†A good selection of amazing restaurants and also some interesting courtyard patios within the restaurants all over the place and wonderful boutique hotels. However I could do without the zipline and decor that I believe makes the place look like an amusement park. Here are some abbreviated tips on some of the many restaurants and hotels:Jardin Nelson- albeit expensive is a great place to come for brunch on a sunny day to enjoy some of the jazz and enjoy a few drinks in their unique courtyard terrace. Gibbys is Fantastic for Steak and I'd declare one of the best steakhouses in the city.The keg - two of them here are your staples for Steak at a dinner to expect to cost $40-$50 pp. Olive and Gourmando- although not eaten there, this is the supposed expensive trendy tourist place for lunch. Modavie, Gaspar and ¬†le Chapagnerie are all gourmet and delicious with different menus. The two top boutique hotels are the St. James- it's been whispered through the grapevine that when Madonna is in town she reserves a whole floor for her and the entourage she travels with. Hotel Nelligan is upscale elegant and very impressive if high end hotels are your budget. The Westin, W and Intercontinental are a bit further walk away but not unreasonable. Just make sure you are able to walk a bit longer. If not, it's always easy to take a cab down. Sure tourists come here in droves and it's understood. Parking is always hellaciously difficult (on the street) and if you park in a city lots is $16 for the day which is gouging in my mind. Overall the place is a 3.5 for me but perhaps I'm somewhat jaded as it's becoming a tad more boring for a local."
"There is just so much to see - history, eating, dining, shopping.Walking around Jacques Cartier place this is pretty much the touristy hot spot of Montreal yet it has such a great charm and vibe you won't mind being a tourist yourself. Old world mixed in with some modern amenities.This area is a terrific spot to stroll the cobblestone streets or wander blissfully along the riverside and take in the sights.More than enough to spend a day or two taking in the historical buildings, plenty of cafes to grab a bite, bars to enjoy a libation, and some street performers always doing something fun to watch.We walked around here for days and never got tired of it. Even just to take a seat at an outdoor bistro to people watch and see the world walk by."
"Old Port is the place to be in the summer. There are so many activities to do, food to eat, people to see. It looks gorgeous in the summertime. Lots of people say it's touristy, which it is, but it still feels so nice. Get a Bixi and you will have an awesome day.Also check out the pirate themed adventure park opening this summer, there's going to be a huge zipline!"
"Beautiful, peaceful wonderful. It is ¬†like once upon a time, a fairy tale and charming and friendly. Boy do I love Canada, the food is excellent and the scenery of Montreal is absolutley stunning."
"The first thing you notice walking in Old Port is the cobblestone! It's sooo nice to be able to enjoy this part of town and absorb the French culture from architecture of the Notre Dame, clock tower and museums. All the sites and shops and restaurants preserve the sophistication of France. No matter the time of year you must stop by. On the summer nights,you'll catch the street concerts and performances. ¬†In the winter months you can ice skate in the St. Laurence River. It can seem a bit touristy at times especially with most of the little shops. But it is considered an attraction."
"Driving through Old Port in Montreal was a treat for our eyes. Beautiful narrow streets with cobblestones, breathtaking majestic buildings leaning from old sites. I am not a huge fan of tourist shops, but I would raise my eyes just a little higher not to be bothered by them.Old Port hosts amazing galleries, shops hotels and restaurants. Too bad its not possible to visit them all. We chose to drink the famous white Sangria in a beautiful Garden Restaurant with live Jazz music. Maybe another tourist spot, but still absolutely amazing. I hope I will be back to explore more streets and shores. And taste that amazing poutine of theirs."
"Absolute visit regardless a tourist or local resident or not. ¬†Big history and architectural buff. ¬†Still remember the cobblestones and water views. ¬†St. Lawrence quite historic. ¬†Imagine even 300 years ago, explorers were using this to cross the Atlantic Ocean."
"You find me, you find meYou find me by the riverYou find me, you find meYou find me where the river flowsBy the riverWhere dreams will never dieBy the riverUnder suburban skiesYou find me, you find meYou find me where the river flows...It reminds me of other Vieux-Port, miles and oceans away, in small town of Marseille... Vieux-Port de Montr√©al share same feeling of open space, artistic freedom and just a right measure of old times charm and grunge. Along it runs functioning railroad, and the bike path, and the walkways that follow curves of the ponds, cutting through park greenery (altho it was snowy white this time around). I am enamored by it industrial charm - and cannot resist those rusty piers and old machinery.Ships still here, and old buildings still stand on water edge, and Clock Tower keeps ticking time away....But the new is weaved in - the clean paved promenade, Science Centre, IMAX.It's nice to walk though any time of the year, and bars/cafes aplenty along the water edge to take a break and enjoy fresh breeze."
"This is a must see place in montreal!! It's my absolute favorite place to go on a sunny day and was tempted to visit multiple times! Old port has most historic buildings, a huge slope that usually has children friendly entertainment and a old city vibe to it with it's cobble stone streets. If you don't visit, you haven't seen montreal properly:) Cheers and enjoy"
"The old port has that special magic during the summer months that one has to experience at least a few times in their lives. The architecture of the buildings are very European. It also has a waterfront with lots of activities, beautiful arts and fancy restos to appeal to both tourists and romantics. It's a nice place. The main street is full of intriguing merchant stalls that will draw you, paint you and entertain you.The problem I have stems of its popularity, I dislike coming here by car as parking and traffic can be quite insane at times. Coming by metro is long and labourous. There's WAY too many people at times (particularly during the fireworks) and the restos are very expensive.This doesn't take away from the Old Port's charm for tourists but as a local I don't go out of my way to come here often."
Had some great pouting here from a food truck called Poutine and Companie. It was very crowded with tourist the Sunday that I was there.
"Wandering around Old Montreal--Vieux Montreal--is a step back in time and well worth the experience. ¬†The negative comments about the touristy shops are well taken, but simply gazing upward to view the wonderful architecture and the unique buildings is rewarding. ¬†There are also parts of the area that are not so tourist-minded and there are wonderful restaurants there as well.This is a part of the city that must be seen."
This place might be a reason for me to move to Montreal. It absolutely beautiful even on a rainy day. It really merges the European and the diverse Canadian culture into one. I love how everything feels very authentic from the architecture down to the cobblestones you walk on. Came here everyday during my weekend stay in Montreal but I would definitely spend a full week just roaming around the port and maybe one day taking a cruise down the river!
"Absolutely beautiful scenery, building with a new urban french style and lots of activities. I checked with my favorite app YELP to see what kind of events was happening around the which to find the Vieux Port/ Old port. Le Festival YUL EAT ( Basically Montreal's version of a Somrgasbur). I didn't get to try any of their delicous food because it was so hot outside but i did get a frozen pleasant Pena colada smoothie that cooled me right down. Everything smelled to great sad i didn't explore."
"Old Port is a pleasant place to visit and walk through, full of eateries, historical sights, and locals and tourists alike. It's nothing out of the ordinary, so if you've never been, you might have a better time heading up to Mont Royal and checking out the park. If you're a local, or have time to kill, why not check out Old Port? Get yourself a nice book and relax.We saw a random event going on where folks were passing one another boxes in a long line - never quite figured that out."
"The old port is excellent in the summer where you can bike around with a couple of pals and relax by the pier, but this time around in the winter....igloofest. Yes a musical festival done out in the freezing cold, only city to do so. The challenge presented gives you no choice but to dance as much as you can for warmth lol, you can't stop. There was the superglisse slide, 2 stages for music, fire pits for warmth which was ideal...the music was great and this whole event was well worth the 340+mile trek from nyc lol. I was there for weekend 2...the upcoming is the last."
"Vieux-Montreal is far and away my favorite part of town. ¬†The city started here in 1642. ¬†No tour of this town would be complete without exploring the cobblestone streets that line the South side along the St. Lawrence River. ¬†You can actually walk through the old ruins at Pointe-a-Calleire. ¬†How cool is that? ¬†This is the place for people watching, trinket shopping and general sightseeing. ¬†There are a lot of landmarks around here, so do your research and explore the history of town. ¬†Don't worry, just about everyone here speaks English and French and will throw the switch when you say ""hello"" and you'll be good. ¬†I made multiple loops through the Place Jacques-Cartier snacking on some great gelato. ¬†My Frommer's led tour was quite insightful and you know what? ¬†That building next to Basilique Notre Dame looks just like the Empire State Building."
"If you have but one day to visit Montreal, this is the one spot you must visit. The Old Port (also known as Old Montreal) is the historic, old part of the city, and it contains all of Montreal's most historic sites and buildings. Take the time to read the plaques affixed to most edifices, as you will get a free history class! There are old museums (and some new ones as well!), and narrow cobblestoned streets (ladies, don't wear high heels!), and gorgeous old stone architecture. Walking down the old streets - especially at night, when the area is illuminated and takes on a magical glow - one truly feels as if one is in an old, old section of Paris. It feels like old Europe. I've never gotten the sense of an authentic, French , historic area outside of France. Certainly not anywhere in the States. And this is precisely why Montreal is unique.Caleches (horse-drawn carriages) are always a-plenty here, night and day. Many of their carriages are ornately bedecked with flowers.There are tons of touristy tchotchke shops here on the main drag (lovely Rue St. Paul), but there are also wonderful restaurants, bistros, art galleries, artists' quarters, ivied courtyards, narrow cobblestoned alleyways hidden off the larger roads, musicians and artists out painting and performing, and more. Central to the are is Place Jacques Cartier, bordered by outdoor terrasses and bistros and gorgeous, imposing old buildings (including old City Hall). To get a feel of life back in the 1600s, you can visit the adjacent Chateau Ramsey, housed in a real home from the 17th century. Bonsecours Market is right off the square as well (note: there are a lot of nice, clean public bathrooms here), as are old churches and more courtyards. ¬†Of course, bordering the whole area is the Port of Montreal and the waterfront. They have really beautified the waterfront in the past ten years or so, and it's very walkable now. One area has food trucks, and there is a long strip of restaurants and shops and vendors, with a large eating area at the base of Rue. St. Laurent. I especially like how they demarcated the streets with large, vertical street signs, and I was also impressed by how they incorporated bike paths and walking trails all along this waterfront strip.There is an impressive, contemporary Museum of Architecture at one end of the waterfront promenade, on Place d'Youville, and a block further lies Gibby's, a wonderful, elegant steakhouse housed in a 200-year old stable building. At night, this whole area is bustling until the wee hours of the morning, due to all the cafes, bistros, clubs and bars. Pedestrians will be out strolling late too, as the stores are open late on weekends and especially in the summer. It'll be hopping even after midnight with young native Montreal's going out clubbing or to hear jazz musicians at The Red Piano. This is a vibrant part of the city and truly not to be missed."
"There's always something going on here to keep everyone entertained. ¬†It's a great place to come visit on a sunny day. ¬†There are food trucks, cheap bike rentals, performances, zip lining and even Clock Tower beach all the way at the end where you can grab drinks and enjoy the sun. ¬†Saturday nights during the summer, it's also great to watch the 10:00 fireworks show. ¬†I loved coming here every evening."
"So yes, walk up and down Place Jacques Cartier, as this is pretty much the touristy hub of Montreal but also adorable and joyful in brief tastes if you're local. The narrow cobblestone alleys that lead off the pedestrian square are pretty and tucked with the usual tshirts and maple candy, their real virtue in them is in leading to the further stretches of the Old Port where there are art galleries and better restaurants and boutiques with higher end designers. If you walk along the water towards the west you can see the giant old grain storage and the speakers on the shore that let you hear your voice echo around the empty old icons of industry. Eat a lobster roll, check out the crazy architecture across the water from back when Montreal was a 60s stoner dream of what the future would look like. I suggest starting from Champ de Mars Metro and then Walking up McGill to Square Victoria but anyway you do it just get lost in there, have some wine and cheese, have fun."
"Nothing beats a nice walk on a beautiful day in a local beautiful location such as the Old Port, adding the Poutinefest stuffing our faces with greasy fries and yummy filling of your choice. With or without the festivities its an enjoyable walk by the water."
"Great place in Montreal to walk around and eat! A bit pricey but worth it! Try skating during the winter, especially at night!"
"I love Old Montreal! I have visited Old Montreal in every seasons.... Of course nothing beat coming here when it is nice and warm with all the patios opens for business and flowers are blooming!During winter, hardly anyone on the street... and it does feels less touristy... and still good for some awesome photos!Interesting architecture and good to have a self guided tours and just walk around... and learn and refresh my Canadian History!"
"Montreal's old port is just amazing. There is always something going on street music, artists or carnival. It's also well known for is cultural and historical side, plenty of activities for family, friends or couples. You can rent boat, go to the spa have a sorbet or a gelato, ear in Montreal's finest restaurant or enjoy nature with a picnic.There's an on water spa in a boat called bota bota which is simply amazing, there science centre with tons of activities, there's the museum, cloths store, clubs, lounge and more it is a must see for tourist"
"Bonjour les Am√©ricains!As my good friend/kindred spirit who we share the same date/year and husband were tour guides to myself and my former love, I felt like I was transported back to Paris, France once again. ¬†Cobblestone streets filled with shoppes/small boutiques, restaurants, and old buildings with ornate detail of French flair architecture. ¬†The streets are immaculately clean! ¬†Old Montr√©al contains so much history as you're walking through an European village indeed. ¬†For history buffs and architects you will be intrigued.Oui, Old Montr√©al is a must not miss!"
"The Old Port is a charming place to walk around if you find yourself in Montreal. Apparently there's bikes you can hire, but my friend and I stuck to walking as a way to poke in and around the little alleyways that we came across along the way. I can imagine that in the height of summer this would be a great place to visit for drinks in the sunshine with friends and family."
This is the area along the water in Montreal. ¬†This area can have some of the best views in the city. ¬†It is also very historical with the cobblestone streets. ¬†The buildings are beautifully built and worth a visit while in the city.
"It's worth coming to the Old Port to see the sights. ¬†You can check out the beach while you're here - and it puts you quite close to the Science Centre. ¬†Another main attraction is the clock tower. ¬†Now, I've said before it's best to avoid this place unless you need to harness 1.21 Gigawatts of electricity to power your Delorian, sending it forward in time to the year 1985...But, the clock tower is rather nice. ¬†And it's worth checking out what you can see from the top. ¬†Just be prepared for lots of stairs. ¬†Lots and lots of stairs.On the plus side - they're all numbered so you know how many you have left."
"Absolutely beautiful, nothing like seeing history."
"It seems like a world away and forever ago, but I experienced the Old Port during the middle of winter. Yep, *that* winter. Luckily, during my time there, the city was experiencing a heat wave of near forty-degree temps. I'm not being a smart-a$$. This past winter was brutal. 40 was warm. Being a long-time Chicagoan, the temps didn't bother me in the least. I'd heard about the Old Port and I wanted to have at it.Like most cities that are built for the cold, Montreal was able to showcase the best of the Old Port without batting an eye. I was absolutely charmed by the cobblestone, bridges, light shows, installations, skating rink, and music. The entire port area was filled with people taking pictures, going on walks, sight seeing, and taking in the fun of a winter wonderland. Walking along the frozen water, I spent a lot of time lost in thought and appreciating the stillness. Yep, despite the kids shrieking (in a good way) at the skating rink and the 'thoom thoom thoom' of the bass as the electronica played on, the quiet beauty of the environment fully enveloped me and I walked through the waterways to attempt to take it all in.With plenty of shops nearby, hot chocolate at the ready and Old Montreal waiting to welcome you, the Old Port gladly gives a taste of Old World life in North America. Living in Miami and coming to this part of Montreal, I felt as though I had time traveled. This is a good thing. It's a very good thing."
"I love Montreal. I was there for a few days and my friends from Montreal showed me around the Port. The architecture in this area is simply gorgeous. The entire town looks very vintage. The streets are cobblestone, great for pictures! We walked around the area and stopped into a random restaurant that serves Cr√™pe. The people here are friendly, polite, courteous, manners you won't find in New York City. There are a few historical sites, plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars, and some street performers. It's a pleasant place to visit. It's beautiful and very clean."
"Wonderful area. Beautiful old architecture, charming, local treats like maple cider and candies, great parks and views. Lovely area with the perks of a larger city but much more convenient and comfortable!"
"There was so much to see and so much to do down here. ¬†The area was clean and I really appreciated the strong WiFi signal. ¬†There was plenty of seating, restaurants, food trucks, and a nice marina. ¬†It was also a great spot for people watching and just enjoying the nice weather."
"The old port is alright in the summer time, less so in the winter. ¬†The area is lined with shops, restaurants, performers and artists all summer long. ¬†In the winter I don't recall seeing any of the performers or artists around.Depending on where you are in the old port the buildings are pretty old, streets are somewhat narrow and the charm isn't to bad either. ¬†There are some great restaurants in and around this area so you should do your research ahead of time if you want to dine here.Take your date for a walk here and grab an ice cream or a drink on a patio. ¬†It's a nice relaxing place with a few churches and courtyards as well."
"While on vacation this summer my hubs and I walked virtually all over the city. On one of the not so nice days weather wise we decided to walk from the plateau area down to the old port. It features some really beautiful architecture, as well as a great view of the saint Lawrence river. The architecture reminds me of the small villages in southern France. We wandered aimlessly looking in shop windows and all the smaller art galleries featuring the work of many well known artists.  ¬† At one point it started to rain so we dipped into one of the many patio restaurants on the main drag and had a quick drink while we waited for the rain to subside. After the rain let up we continued our walk soaking in the sights and sounds. There are so many curio shops that have some of the cutest statues, my favorite was a toddler hoisting the stanley cup above its head.  ¬† It is such a lovely area to see, albeit filled with tourists toting cameras."
"We were so excited to come to this place ... The location was superb. ¬†So after walking by in the afternoon, I decided to head back with my spouse. ¬†They have a very nice casual sitting area to the right with comfy couches. ¬†The night was beautiful so the atmosphere was great with the cool night air and the Latin dance beat playing overhead. We got there at 9:15 and there were 7 tables ... so not too busy. ¬†First they didn't bring us a menu for a full 10 minutes, so I finally gave up, hailed one of the waiters and asked for the menu. ¬†Then we watched him head back to the bar, clean up, do something on the computer and load up drinks for the table next to us and still no menu. ¬†After shooting him a couple of looks, he finally brought it almost 20 minutes after we had arrived. ¬†In retrospect, this was the missed moment when we should have gotten up and left. Everything after that was poor service. Yes our waitress was nice but when you ignore us and prioritize bussing a table to bringing us our check, I don't really care if you're friendly. The chicken sandwich was yummy, but the mojito needed more authenticity. ¬†I wouldn't come again although if they had a dance floor to go along with their Latin dance music, I might swing by for a night out... as long as it didn't involve table waiting or watered down mojitoes."
"Great place, Great atmosphere. Its person for people who've lived here forever, or for people who are visiting. Theres always something new. Its nice to just walk down along the pier or just walk into the old port to see the old shops and old streets. The restos are expensive, but thats normal for a very touristy area.Make sure to check out the square right in the middle of the action. In the summer there are artists who do caricatures and so on.In the winter, there are usually some great maple syrup stands (but its really expensive)."
"So freaking gorgeous!We were here on a lovely, beautiful, 75degree weather day in Montreal. Old Montreal is the best for taking an absentminded stroll throughout their cobblestone streets or along the riverside. The area is so quaint and charming, and there are a ton of al fresco places around here, if you looooooove outside dining like I do! ;) There are also a crapton of souvie shops, and surprisingly the prices are too bad! Make sure you taste some maple syrup & ice wine along the road!Some tips if you are driving:- Pay CLOSE attention to the signage. At the very least, know the French words for the days of the week so you know when you can and cannot park in a particular spot.- If you park along the parking meters, take note of your parking spot letter & number and go pay at the machine nearby. You will not need to put any receipts on your dashboard.- Don't get stuck behind a horse carriage. If you do, best of luck."
"This is a great place to spend a day. So much to see and do. Shopping, restaurants, street performers and lots of people watching. There is history everywhere. ¬†We rented those pedal carts and had a blast tooling around the area. Watch out for zombies!"
"Beautiful place and a must for our first visit to Montreal. Old Montreal has that romantic and picturesque feel as soon as you lay your eyes on this place. With it's European style architecture and cobblestone roads that is parallel to the St. Lawrence River, it makes for a perfect stroll and date night. Even though this place may be a popular spot for tourists, I just didn't feel like it was. It was nice and quiet when we went and it was raining as well, felt like something out of a movie. There are a ton of restaurants and places to shop to buy random stuff and of course souvenirs.You can take the Metro to get here like we did and venture out and take a ton of photos. You'll be glad you made a special trip out here."
"Once and Old Port for Montreal, this is now mostly a tourist destination. This is a lovely little walk along the river. There is a small market during the Christmas season which is really wonderful. It is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas though so keep that in mind. There is a bridge that takes you to a lovely little park where you can some nice views of the river. There is a skating rink in this area in the wintertime as well. You an still see some larger ships bringing in shipments into the functional part of the port. Really lovely site in Old Montreal!"
"The Old Port is a place to go for a fantastic experience where you technically don't even need to spend a dime. I had some wonderful moments of relaxing, viewing the sights, and just sitting with my friends and talking. I didn't even do all the shopping at the time because we were kind of beat from a lot of walking up to that point, but even with missing out on the actual attractions in the form of stores and services offered, the pleasant atmosphere won my heart. I'd love to go back and explore again, one day."
"In our relatively new nation of Canada, one sometimes needs a little boost of old world charm and craggy worn history... the old port in Montreal is the perfect place to roll out your Euro cool.The old port area has it all, restaurants, artists, shops, entertainment, great nightlife and was the birthplace of commerce in Canada, and Cirque du Soleil. Who doesn't love clowns??? I live in Vancouver now, but when I need my spirit and soul reloaded... I plan my expedition ""home"" and go for a croissant stuffed with melting chocolat and a cappuccino.If you go, plan to slow down, stroll, and watch for horse droppings."
"The Old Port is one of those magical places that made me fall in love with Montreal. This part of town houses most of the historical buildings in the city, and runs alongside the piers on the St. Lawrence River.It's a great place to hang out during the day. You can visit all the tourist attractions and admire the architecture of the historical structures. There are tons of fancy art shops along the streets for you to check out. It's also nice to walk or run along the water while the sun is out. This was part of one of my running routes, going through the Old Port to Ile Saint Helene and back. During the night, it's a great place to admire the city lights as well as for stargazing. The lights from the city blends with the stars, lightly illuminating the historical buildings and giving off a quaint sense of relief. I always walk around there at night when I need some room to breathe and some private time just to ponder about life. In the Winter season, there's a skating rink there worth checking out. It costs more than Parc La Fontaine (which is free) but they usually have better ice and awesome music selection. Igloofest is also held there, and is something you must check out if you're ever in the area at that freezing time of the year ;)"
"If you're in Montreal its definitely worth taking the time to visit Old Port. Here you can find some small cafes, historical sites, restaurants, shops and a nice mile long street adjacent to the piers where you can ride a BIXI bike or go for a nice walk. Here you can also find some street performers hired by Montreal which will provide pretty cool street shows. If you are a fan of crepes you will find good crepe restaurants all over the place."
"Warning - tourist trap ahead! ¬†I like 'old' but I'm not sure that I would call Old Montreal 'old.' ¬†Maybe 'older' but not 'old.' ¬†There is certainly plenty to do here (shop, eat, drink) but most of it seemed more geared towards tourists than locals. ¬†When I travel, I tend to like to go where the locals go and avoid the touristy places so I didn't spend much time here after checking it out.Most of the restaurants here serve the same things, for the same prices, but it is nice to be able to sit out on the patios and enjoy some nice weather.Definitely check it out, but don't plan your entire trip around it."
"This review is for Old Port, not for Old Town Montreal. ¬†These are two separate areas.Vieux Port is basically a long stretch of land that lines Riviere du Nord, Montreal's waterfront. ¬†Although parts of it are quiet and peaceful with not many people milling around, the further north you walk the more action there is. ¬†There are segway, pedal boat and quadricycle rentals, an imax movie theater, a beach, etc. ¬†Plenty of activities to keep you occupied. ¬†I actually preferred the southern end of the port, as it it much quieter. ¬†It was nice to just sit on a bench after a long day of walking and enjoy the view of the river."
"Very nicely organized with biking lanes, walking paths and entertainment spaces and green spaces. ¬†Walk or bike along the waterfront and enjoy the view, as a tourist this place is nice to see how clean and organize it is. ¬†Plenty to see and do here, if I more time I would get some take-out, and a bixy bike and enjoy this area a little more."
"Not to be missed is this historic area of Montreal, which if you love old buildings and architecture as much as I do, you will have your camera out and be taking photos non-stop!Aside from the buildings there are many restuarants with lovely patios, shoppes to check in to, and if you want to be a really good tourist there are horse drawn carriages.A must see in this city!"
"We walked around Old Montreal for part of our day and I feel like it would be more fun any other time of year besides winter. There wasn't much going on besides skating and horse-drawn carriage rides. The skating was pretty good, just a bit busy. It's quaint with cobblestone streets, cute store signs, and nice views of the water. Lots of little shops, art galleries, and cafes to check out. So a nice place to go for charm and walking--be sure to wear flats."
"So we'll set up. So much to do. Walk or metro there. Parking expensive. $5 for beach entrance. Lots of free things to do. Boat rides, zip lining and boat rides $. Restaurants, food trucks and a super beautiful Boardwalk!"
the architecture is beautiful with each building having its own little quirksyou can spend a few hours or 2 days
I felt like I had ¬†teleported to Europe when I walked through Old Montreal. Everything was amazing from the street performers to the food to the cobblestone streets. Head to the Place Jacques-Cartier to see all types of street performers and artists and others selling various wares and goods. There are also many restaurants right off the square. Bonsecours Market also has shopping and eats. For an excellent steak in Old Montreal look at my review for St. Paul's Steak Frites.
"You can't miss strolling through Vieux Port and Vieux Montreal on a visit to the city. ¬†It's not spectacular, but it is something absolutely lovely. ¬†Just the walk through Vieux Montreal is soul-warming itself (loved the narrow streets, and old cobblestone paths), and then arriving at the Port is a pleasant ending to the walk. ¬†I was there on a sunny day in the tail end of summer, and it was filled with rollerskaters/bladers, bicyclists, joggers, walkers, a military band, pets, and simply a great vibe to be in. ¬†The narrow park that lines sort of the center of the walk along the port, is also beautiful this time of year. ¬†Lots of green and orange. ¬†The port/water itself is just like any other bod of water. ¬†There are navy ships docked, and also an apartment complex across the water that used to be the ""projects"", but are today, luxury apartments. :)"
"My favorite spot in Montreal.This is a popular tourist spot, but lots of locals also relaxes here. There is always endless things to do and see. In the spring/summer when weather is perfect, there are entertainers who does shows around this area cheered on by the crowds. Tons of restaurants and little shops along the side to pop in and out for a quick beaver tail or ice cream or formal meal. There are small food stands and alleys of artists who sells their works or would make your cartoon portrait in a heartbeat. I love the feeling of sitting on the benches there watching the clouds and decompress. The science museum is very nearby with special Exhibitions. It's also a great spot to watch the international fireworks show happening across the river at La Ronde. In the winter, the ice rink is open to the public and they have yummy maple taffy stands in the middle of the street.Very walkable, good for exercise, gorgeous spot to relax and enjoy the day."
"I love Montreal. It is one of top most happening cities in north America. ¬†From the food to the people serving the food, such a classy city. I appreciate Old Montreal especially because of the history and tranquility. The night life in Old Montreal is amazing too. It is a vibe that we do not have in California or Vegas."
"Quaint and historic area of Montreal, cobblestone walkways, shopping, little cafes where many tourists eat/drink and spend money on stuff that ends up collecting dust later on, but thats part of the visitor experience. The streets, alley ways and architecture scream european. You almost forget that you're only a border hop away from the US.. In fact they have those little eye catching details down pat. They also have horse drawn carriages for those who want to round out their old port experience (and piss off some of the crazy montreal drivers)...."
"My girlfriend and I visited Old Port on a cloudy cold winter day. ¬†The plan was to go ice skating on the Bonsecour Basin. ¬†Despite the weather, we highly enjoyed our ice skating experience ( on the artificial rink). ¬†Great music and spacial layout for all ice skaters."
I was continually amazed at the stark contrast of neighborhoods and the plethora of diversity in regards to beautiful spots in Montreal. This landmark is no different. It was great to take a long lunch break from working at UQAM to take a stroll towards the old city and port. It was a beautiful day and people were walking and running along the harbor. Locals are very lucky to have a place like this downtown.
"I'm not really going to review this...there is too much to review except to say if you find yourself with just a few hours in Montreal, this is probably the place to spend them. ¬†Check the other reviews for things to do. ¬†I found the Montreal city website dedicated to a walking tour of Old Montreal incredibly helpful for learning the history of the area one building at a time. ¬†vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tou‚Ä¶. ¬†(With Pictures!)"
This area needs to be at the top of your must-see list. So quaint and romantic. I spent hours just wandering aimlessly through the cobblestone streets lined with art galleries and eateries - the hardest decision I had to make was choosing just one of the cosy little restaurants! i had to keep reminding myself I wasn't in Europe. Very beautiful.
"Seriously? ¬†A business listing for a whole city? ¬†Really? ¬†Wow!Well since it's here I guess I'll go ahead and review Old Montreal while the whole experience is still fresh in my little dinosaur sized pebble brain...After driving for over 10 hours from the DC area to Montreal, visiting Old Montreal feels like my car magically sprouted wings and crossed the Atlantic at some supersonic speed. ¬†I could rub my eyes and pinch myself, but my senses and aforementioned little brain would still tell me, ""Hey fatty, you're in some European town...check out the history! ¬†The sites! ¬†The smell of the food and the little outdoor cafes!""To which I'd reply to my brain, ""Hey, shut up you! ¬†I'll teach you to think on your own...here, have a tasty cerveza!""""Cerveza! ¬†Yes! ¬†YES! ¬†YES!! ¬†Give me more fat boy! Umm ummm umm...*""And then the voices in my head would slowly quell until they altogether ceased. ¬†And me sitting there with an impish smile and trace signs of drool pooling at the edge of a grin...as North America fades away into the background of common sense and I give into the notion that I am indeed in Europe.Old Montreal is a mix of the old, the new and the very ""Oui Oui"". ¬†Walk for 5 minutes and you're bound to leave the old cobble stone streets to a newer more modern area as if to encase the historical pedigree of Montreal with a wall of high rise buildings and corporate letters. ¬†Walk another five minutes and you'll pass through the Chinatown arch with colorful reminders of yet another culture that is part of the Montreal melting pot.There is so much to see, so much to do and so so much to eat. ¬†I just wish that I had a little more time in this city to enjoy a tasty brew at an outdoor table or to slowly sip a small cup of espresso as the citizens and tourists danced the dance of pedestrian life flowing between here, there and who knows where...That my friends, is what Montreal means to me. ¬†:-)"
"What a BIG disappointment!!!This is supposed to be the biggest tourist attraction in the city?!?! ¬†It was average. ¬†The architecture was mildly interesting but not awe inspiring. ¬†Worst of all, some the buildings were shabby with the facade falling off. ¬†Some were rusting and abandoned. ¬†I had to go to Canada to see this? ¬†Don't insult Europe and claim that it's just like being there.Don't waste your time going to Montreal. ¬†Go to Toronto or Vancouver instead."
"We stayed in the downtown area but visited Old Town twice in as many days. ¬†Much better place for a family visit than downtown. ¬†Lots of dining options, free music, and some really interested other free entertainment. ¬†Some of the shops are very touristy but others are artisan. ¬†You will need a complete day and evening to experience all that is available here."
"If you love history, I would definitely recommend checking out this area of town. ¬†As other reviewers have mentioned, it feels as though you're across the Atlantic. ¬†When I've visited other parts of Canada before, I've always thought that it's not so dramatically different than visiting other states (Sorry Canadians, but that's how I felt), but visiting Montreal, especially old Montreal has definitely made me more aware that I'm in a foreign land. ¬†Although old Montreal is very touristy, it is worth walking around and stopping in at the shops along the way."
"It's very calm and nice to walk around, but it was dead in the entire area. It was 5pm on a Monday.A lot of stops and restaurants were not open."
"On a nice day, you should head down to Old Montreal and walk on the cobblestoned streets. It's a great place for pictures, for souvenir shopping, for eating and for just people watching.When you're done with this area, head over to the Old Port area along the water and do some more walking along this area. If you're tired of walking, you can always pay for: a horse-drawn carriage ride, a double/triple/quadruple seated bike or go to the water and rent a paddle boat.A lovely area that even the locals appreciate, for we saw 4 pairs of newlyweds getting their photos taken around the area."
"My girlfriend and I, are used to take long walks in old port on saturday evening summer/winter, doesn't matter. This place is perfect for couples :D"
"Favorite place in Montreal! I could walk the streets all day, looking in shop windows, eating, people watching, taking in the architecture! What a great place, must visit if ever in Montreal!!"
"A little sliver of Europe in North America. Very cool area, leave plenty of time to wander the cobble stone streets."
"I'm not here to review the Old Port as a tourist attraction. As a spot to visit, the Old Port is great. It's bustling in the summer, quaint in the winter. Things get a bit pricey, but you can go for the charm, it's free! And who can resist a labyrinth, regardless of the cost?Instead, I'd like to review a function of the Old Port that folks often forget about, the fact that it is also a show venue. Les Quais du Viex-Port is a section of the Old Port that sometimes gets turned into a concert stage. This might be great for summer events and free shows. However, I'm not so convinced about how it gets converted into an entrance-fee venue. I saw Bj√∂rk perform there a couple of years ago, and it was fantastic, but let's face it, that's because it was Bj√∂rk. Aside from the musical component, the ""venue"" is just a flat gravel surface surrounded by a makeshift fence. Not exactly ideal ambiance for more intimate gigs. I decided to write this review because I'll be seeing Portishead play at les Quais du Vieux-Port in October. While I'm thrilled about the show, as the trip-hop defining band have not been here since 1998, I'm not so thrilled about the venue. Add to that the fact that it's an outdoor show in October in Montreal? I'll pray that the music gods look kindly on us and spare us the rain or temperatures hovering around Zero. Portishead will put cartoon stars and hearts in my eyes. Les Quais du Vieux-Port, not so much."
"good place to walk around and get some fresh air, a few cute gardens and churches to wander into. very touristy and thus over-priced gift shops and mediocre-looking restaurants. lots of bugs and a few interesting offerings like the labyrinth and cirque du soleil."
"Fabulous area of town to walk through - don't forget your camera. Unlike any ""old"" or historic part of any city in Canada (that I've been in anyway... Victoria, Vancouver, Toronto... I'm not sure if any part of Calgary is old...). An amazing feel to this area of Montreal, and lots of places to eat or drink coffee."
"Easily my favorite part of Montreal.The old stone buildings and narrow cobblestone streets give you that very quaint feel of walking through an old European village.The cafes provide plenty of opportunity for people watching while sipping on coffee or chomping down on your croques-monsieurs. If you manage to get a patio seat at one the restaurants on Place Jacques-Cartier you can even take in a show presented to you by street performers.Art lovers can give their wallets a good workout at any of the many galleries that line up along Rue Notre-Dame.The Basilica Notre-Dame is a must see for only $5 and for another $5 you can catch the light show which I hear is very beautiful.If you tire of walking there are horse carriages waiting to whisk you away on a tour of the old town, the car drivers stuck behind it won't enjoy it so much however. :)There is so much more to do, including the old port, but the above is a good start."
"When you walk the cobble stoned streets of Old Montreal, you feel like you are walking down a European street. So beautiful, so quaint and is a must for any person visiting Montreal. Great dining in the area."
"Lots to do, some of it touristy some of it just plain fun.Best thing besides just walking around and people watching was ¬†the paddleboats at the basin bonsecours. ¬†We went in the evening towards sunset and it was just a peaceful and fun way to watch all the activity of the port and still relax and be on the water.Great for couples or even families with kids, lifejackets available but not mandatory. ¬†about $17 canadian gets you 30 minutes, but they didn't really enforce it so you don't have to watch the clock."
Very cool spot to check out. Lots of nice eateries in the area. We were fortunate to stumble over here on Canada. There were tons of activities to do.
"We thoroughly enjoyed our vacation to Montreal and this was the high point of the trip. ¬†Pedestrian friendly, abundance of cafes, nicely landscaped, lovely shops filled with French linens, soaps, ceramics, etc. Striking, old buildings, gorgeous river views and lots of points of interest. As many have probably said, for North Americans, Vieux Montreal is a European experience w/o the jet lag."
"Old Montreal is my favorite part of the city. If you like to view or purchase art for your home, love small coffee shops or even a good bar then this part of the city is the place for you to check out. There are the touristy spots there but the old feel of the city has not been lost there. Check out the City museum located near the water front. If you are staying downtown take a taxi or walk to the old city. Parking in this area is hard to find especially in the evening and weekends."
definitely check it out. ¬†love the old stone buildings and cool businesses. ¬†and close to the water too.
"I spent a couple days in Montreal, and Old Montreal was absolutely the best! It was beautiful and ¬†had such great character. I highly recommend going down to the Port."
"I don't come to this park often but I really should. Recently, I took a stroll here around 9pm and it was so pleasant. There were a bit of bugs but nothing too major. I was lucky enough to see a family of ducks! The cutest thing!!"
"Big parc , many places for picnic, for sport, a nice fountain, path for bike and trees to get some shadow."
"Though not grand like Mont Royal, Parc Jarry had the charm of a quaint, beautiful local urban park. Equipped with everything from baseball field, tennis courts to basketball fields and featuring an interweaving trail throughout the entire park, this is a popular spot for runners, bikers and various sport enthusiasts to practice their skills. During the first days of spring, the park is alive with squirrels scurrying up trees and playful ducks on the lake. Sitting on the benches relaxing while people watching is a pleasure within itself.A mini urban paradise."
"Important update: I now love the pool here. They added fencing to extend the pool-side sitting area beyond the hot concrete so you can lie on the grass under a tree between dippings. There is always a breeze here, and the pool is always free. Magique."
"I went for a run through here on my recent trip to Montreal. ¬†I was staying close by, so I also ran the 5 blocks to/from the park. ¬†It has plenty of paths and sidewalks, as well as a large pond and fountain. ¬†There's a decently sized hill and a small wooded area you can run through. ¬†There are also tennis courts, basketball courts, a hockey rink, soccer fields, a baseball field, and lots of grassy areas for laying out in the sun. ¬†There was also a swimming pool, but it was closed :(I thoroughly enjoyed my run through here, despite its brevity."
"The most lovely park I visited in Montreal! I was completely in love with the lake and its ducks, the willow trees and the tables underneath them. It felt so romantic, even though it's a relatively small park. The lake water wasn't weirldly green (thank god) and the ducks looked healthy. Bonus points for non-polluted nature! There's lots of spots where to sit, on the rocks across the lake, on the tables, on the grass... The pool at the park is awesome too."
"Love, love, love Parc Jarry; it's super close to Little Italy so loading up pre-BBQ is easy peasy and the people watching is fine. Skip across the rocks and enjoy chilling on the little island but don't drink too much beer as the hike to find the washroom is a tad far."
"nice enough park to walk through. ¬†much more interesting when there is a tennis tournament, or ¬†event."
I love this park simply because it's close to home and during the spring summer and fall you can catch a soccer game here at almost any time.
"We are very big fans of Kate McGarrigle from upstate NY and were so grateful to have this beautiful place to visit and remember her during our visit to Montreal. The ""Kate and Nora"" sculpture is a perfect tribute. There was an upright piano next to the sculpture that was covered and locked- we looked under the cover and saw that it was beautifully painted! It is wonderful to imagine music being played in that sacred space to celebrate Kate's memory. The neighborhood is lovely, it was easy to find a place to have lunch nearby after our visit. Our thanks to the city of Montreal for providing a space to honor the great Kate McGarrigle."
"Place Kate-McGarrigle was inaugurated on August 7, 2013, in memory of local musician Kate McGarrigle (known to many as one half of the folksinging duo Kate and Anna McGarrigle, as well as the mother of Rufus and Martha Wainwright).The small, neat park and public square is located among high-end shops on Laurier Avenue West, near to Kate McGarrigle's old home. It has benches, granite seats, and a chair sculpture by the American artist Robert Wilson (donated by the family). It's a nice spot to take a break from a walk or shopping on Laurier, and maybe reflect on Kate McGarrigle and her musical legacy."
"Absolutely love this park. ¬†Have been here many many times and each time it gets more pretty. ¬†I remember the first time we stumbled upon this park and was just in awe of the gorgeous fountain. ¬†Also the beautiful old homes that flank the park...I'm usually not a hater, but I am so jealous of those residents to be able to have this little square as their front yard.Last time I was there I saw these odd giant rocks placed around part of the park. ¬†Thought it was weird and random...have they always been there and I never noticed? ¬†Apparently, yes. ¬†As I made my way back to leave the park to I noticed a woman cleaning off one of the giant rocks. ¬†I asked her if she is familiar with the park and what are these large rocks. ¬†She laughed and said it is art, pieces of bronze sculpted by a famous artists. ¬†Ooops, my bad. ¬†Hahahah! ¬†Well, sorry, there is no sign or anything. ¬†She looked around and to her surprise, realized I was right. ¬†She felt obliged to tell me about the artist. ¬†She also mentioned that he made a famous piece that is displayed in San Francisco. ¬†What? ¬†I lived in SF...how did I not know about this man and at least the piece he has in the heart of the City? ¬†I had to look him up.In addition to learning about this man, I also learned that the woman who was cleaning off his bronze is actually loosely related to him. ¬†So I had a chance to learn about the artist from one of his own family members. ¬†How cool is that? ¬†Sometimes you have to just ask a complete stranger that stupid question...""Is this art?"" ¬†I did it and the response left me humbled and honored at the same time."
"We happened on this stunning outdoor space walking from the metro to our chocolate restaurant. Pictures do not do it justice.I am a sucker for squares, and have always wanted to live on or near one. ¬†The homes in this area are beautiful. ¬†Folks were sitting and reading, laying on blankets, and picnicking on this warm summer day.Idyllic....except maybe the man urinating on one of the porches....a bit TMI! City life..."
Carre St Louis or Square St Louis is my favourite park in Montreal. ¬†In any of the three seasons (minus winter as I never come here in the cold) it's absolutely idyllic! ¬†It's Montreal's version of Bryant Square park but much nicer! ¬†There is a very cool fountain in the middle and majestic old trees that provide shade and allow for cover from the sun! The houses that line the park speak to the old world architechtue that is quite prevalent and well kept in Montreal. ¬†I imagine in my mind many poets and artists living here but rather it's probably urban professionals. ¬† ¬†Unfortunately there are many sketchy characters (some homeless) and young individuals partaking in a toke of weed/pot or drink in the park which is rather unfortunate. ¬†It would be nicer (and safer feeling) without the seedy people. ¬†The pot people don't bother me it's the other individuals. ¬†However if you don't make eye contact they pretty much stay to themselves! ¬†This would make it a 5/5 for me if it was cleaned up but for some this is probably their home! ¬†I'd let my daughter roam freely if different however I keep her close by. ¬†Come stroll on a wonderful blue sky day or come as the leaves change ¬†Open your imagination and relax as you stroll through!
"Wonderful and quaint little park with beautiful Victorian style homes surrounding it that look like something out of a Disney fairytale. Many look old and somewhat like a castle. So very cool.Lush foliage, green grass, flowers, benches, and walkways thoughout. A commom area centered by a fountain and statue.The neighborhood that surrounds it features beautiful homes and residential structures.This park is a locals haven to relax and enjoy the fresh air. There is also seating along the outside on the sidewalks. If I lived here I would be at this park a lot. Still, as clean as this park is I still don't understand the graffiti painted or scratched onto some of the structures such as the fountain. What is wrong with people who do that?As it was we were only able to visit a few times while walking over to St Denis street, and take a few moments to sit on a bench to rest our feet. The locals are lucky to have a nice place like this close to where they live."
"The Victorian chic of the streets & houses around Square Saint-Louis...They stand in the same line as San Francisco Painted Ladies. Emanating same charm as Punta Arena's Plaza Mu√±oz Gamero.Reminiscent in feel of open courtyards along Sienna river....You will hear your heart sing when you see colorful rooftops surrounding this square.Shades of the tall trees, urban sculptures dotted throughout park alleys, wooden benches warmed by the sun, and narrow streets around it - a symphony of colors and architecture.I spend quiet hours in the morning enjoying little warmth of winter sun, and long hours in many afternoons, walking streets around it with my little camera in hand.It is beautiful and peaceful. A retreat, a rest stop, an eye candy.A place to see, a place to remember."
"Perfect little park and resting spot in the heart of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal surrounded by stately Victorian homes with beautiful, even whimsical features that evoke a sense of joie de vivre."
"St. Louis Square is one of those special places that makes Montreal a great city.Surrounded on three sides by beautiful homes and on the fourth by Rue St. Denis, this square is a beautiful urban oasis cloaked in bustle and green in the summer, yet perhaps more striking in the winter when the branches of its year-round residents hold snow and stillness equally."
"A cute, quaint park with absolutely beautiful homes surrounding it. The houses have such colourful rooftops and all their decorations/style are so unique! ¬†Since the weather was super nice when I visited, there were plenty of people laying on the grass, kids and parents having fun with the fountain and pinicking. The square itself isn't that big, but there's plenty of grassy space and also enough paths to walk through, that you definitely won't need to tread through any grassy areas."
Great park - we could sit and watch these silly squirrels play for hours. ¬†Seriously the most hilarious squirrels I have ever encountered.We had coffee at the little cafe one morning and it was so relaxing to sit in this park and people watch.We came here twice during our 4 day stay - so glad we happened upon this park!
"Carre St-Louis is a wonderful pocket park in a neighborhood of Victorian homes. ¬†It preserves the essence of the time it was designed and is an integral part of what makes Montreal a captivating city to visit or inhabit. ¬†If comparisons are possible, Fitler Square in Philadelphia and Gramercy Park in New York offer a similar sentimentality. The area is worth a long stroll and bench sitting. ¬†A pedestrian walk sits to the west of the Square. ¬†It is lined with restaurants and cafes, many outdoors. ¬†There is a central structure in the Square that has been converted into a small caf√©. ¬†Tables and chairs await you. ¬†On the morning we were there, two guitarists were practicing something new and working out the kinks in their harmonies. Great free entertainment. To be complete, there are also homeless and questionable characters hanging out, but they kept to themselves for the most part. ¬†It pays to be a little careful and aware while enjoying yourselves. But, it is their Carre, too."
Nice restful park with massive maple trees that provide shade. ¬†Has a small concession in the middle. ¬†Restaurants nearby in a side street. ¬†Has a central fountain area.
"Just a sweet little square at the end of the cobblestones, not a park in the sense of swings and sandboxes, just a lovely little green spot. Carr√© St Louis is one pretty layered fountain with rings of benches around it, a caf√© only open in the summer for selling ice cream and latt√©s, typical bright Montreal architecture facing the square where a mix of students and great Quebec artists and playwrights make their homes. There is some romance in the air here that must explain all our 5 star reviews... this may also explain why I have hazy memories of splashing through said fountain in summer dress and sandals some summer night another lifetime ago..."
"What a great little park in Montreal. It reminds me of NYC, Washington Square park. Surrounded by beautiful brownstones and it's very quiet. Just a block over you're right by several restaurants. I haven't seen any homeless people while walking though but I wouldn't be surprised if some were here in the evening. Montreal is a beautiful city but lots of homeless people."
"One of my favorite little parks in Montreal, I always look forward to a stop there on my way to St. Laurent from the Sherbrooke Metro Station. I have seen this place in all four seasons and each season has a charm all its own. In the summertime St-Louis is at its most lively, yet the fall foliage can be breath takingly beautiful, the winter time covered in snow it is solitary, regal and majestic. There are lovely old multi colored houses/apartment buildings that border the park that are a photo op any time of year and are quite splendid in their use of color. There are benches surrounding the fountain in the center of the park which invite a moments stop to sit, reflect and view the surrounding beauty from within this little oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Montreal."
"Small little cute beautiful park. ¬†Everybody who have ever checked ""Montreal"", you guys already know this park without knowing it. ¬†Check the photos I just put up. During winter, it's little hard to see how beautiful this park is but Spring to Fall, you have to come here and enjoy the view, houses around park, and little veggie vendor. ¬†The veggie vendor owner closes for winter but during the 3 other seasons, you can buy fresh Quebecois veggies and fruits. ¬†All very cheap and fresh. ¬†I saw many tourists took photos in front of the little stand.."
"Square St Louis.. I have had a place on Carre St Louis for about 9 years now and I can tell you lots of stories about what goes on in that parc, but the bottom line is that it is unique. ¬†This is one of those really cool places where you can see all and I do mean ALL walks of life and styles meeting in one common area. ¬†On any given warm summer day you will see mom's with their babies or toddlers, couples on a date, office people on lunch break, a roving group of squeegees, dog owners and their pets (one of which is Clooney the Vietnamese pot Belly pig), assorted musicians, and lions tigers and bears oh my!! ¬†The part with the Tiger is only partially a joke as I personally once played with a 180lbs 11 month old tiger in said fountain, a mere 20+ years ago...The park is always very well landscaped and has been ever since Mayor botanical gardens, was around making it a very lovely place indeed. ¬†The surrounding buildings offer any photographer/ architect student lots of material to view and discuss and one can often see groups of students getting a tour of the various buildings.You can find the row of multi coloured Victorians on the north side on many a Montreal post card, on the south side you can see the Vogel building (294), this building was once the first private hospital started by Mr Vogel, and for many years was the home of Michel Tremblay (5th floor), a renown writer who was very certainly influenced by this Square, among other Montreal locations.Also nice is the use of the building located on the ouest side (near Laval), where they make crepes, ¬†homemade ice cream, fresh squeezed orange juice and where you will find an outdoor fruit and vegetable stand. ¬†The little sitting area just off the cantine, is where you can sit and listen to various and varied musicians, who may or may not add a dancer to their outdoor show.If you in the area and want to have a fun day just sit and people watch, you will not be bored, to make this even better go ahead and google the Square, and surrounding buildings, you will find some interesting facts about it's rich history."
"I've been to Montreal twice now, and have made it a necessity to visit St Louis Square. Victorian inspired homes line the park. I've taken over 100+ pictures of all of the homes near and around the park. I'm sure the locals are annoyed by tourists like me, but the homes are so visually appealing that I can't help posing in front of them. My favorite is the red/blue/purple trio of homes right across the little street from the park. I also adore the homes that look like medieval castles.The park itself has dozens of benches, gorgeous trees, and my favorite - a plague of squirrels. I could spend my entire trip sitting on the benches and feeding the squirrels. I'm not sure what the rules are in Montreal in regards to squirrel feeding (I couldn't find any legitimate information), but nonetheless I have a blast feeding them.It is located right by the subway station Sherbrooke and is close to Mont Royal (a wicked shopping spot). I love this park and will continue to visit it every time I am in Montreal."
"It might just be because me and the boy had a romantic moment here, but I'm now a thorough fan of Carr√© St-Louis. ¬†But maybe that's what you should head here for as well.The houses around the square are amazing and the square itself has the most delightful fountain where you can sit on the benches around it and watch some of the more daring take a midnight dip. ¬†There is a small shop in the middle where you can buy fruits and veggies as well as ice creams and sweets to enjoy whilst relaxing away in the shade of the surrounding trees. ¬†I could spend hours sitting here and may well do just that next time I'm in Montreal!"
"Parc Outremont is great for running, lounging, picnic-ing, and playing frisbee. I remember running laps around this parc for PE, hanging out in the parc during breaks, eating outside with family. It's a nice friendly parc. It is very family oriented so no alcohol is allowed, also it ""closes"" at a certain time so you can't really loiter around after hours.It's a great, green and relaxing parc. There's a pond and a kids playground."
Very small park for this area. But it has pound with fountain in the middle. It's not big as deep ¬†and water has strange color and smell. There's no water fountain for drinking. But u can find small place for kids with different fasilities
"Another sweet tucked away Montreal green space, surrounded by old Victorian red stone houses, populated by local families, kids on scooters and bikes rolling through the paths. This is not the BBQ picnic scene of Laurier or Esplanade (because I think technically Bbqs are not allowed here... But it's been known to happen ;) It's a much more low key neighbourhood shady tree block with fountain bubbling, nothing fancy, just the scene of some of those truly sweet Montreal moments outside of time."
Best place to go and relax. I've been coming here for years and I wouldn't go anywhere else.There's lots of places in the park that arePacked with people but there's a few spots that you can actually get peace and quiet. Weekends are madness so come early afternoon during the week for picnic or just to think. Love this park
"Covid warning - very few people here seem to be observing social distancing rules nor are they wearing masks. The riverside parks and Verdun and LaSalle have been packed solid the past few days because of the warm weather. Runners, joggers, bikers, strollers, families doing BBQ and picnics, kids, couples, guys hanging out downing a couple of brewskis together, they've all been here in droves. I've seen very, very few people keeping the social distance rules or wearing the required masks. I don't think people seem to understand the gravity of this pandemic and are just treating the warm days as some kind of vacation holiday. I don't mean to be a killjoy but Quebec is the epicentre of the Canadian pandemic. Think about it, People."
"Super lovely park! Another extension along the parks all along LaSalle Blvd this one starts in the Desmarchais street area (how surprising) of Verdun. Available parking in the lot next to Crescendo, but plenty of possibility to park in the street too so driving to enjoy this park is perfectly reasonable. Nice pedestrian bridge in the area, the path goes along near the water with many benches and lovely grassy spots to throw a blanket for a picnic. There is also a boat launch area that many people were trying to access today (finally a super nice day!!)...but unfortunately city workers had it blocked off temporarily to place buoys (surely as part of the flood warning measures). We will definitely be back with Irie, lots of dogs walking with their owners enjoying the lovely trail too. A beautiful relaxing spot!"
"All roads lead to the canal and this is one of the many entry points to the canal. ¬†It's the closest one to me so we use it often. ¬†Also, if you've been walking a while and need a little pick me up, just head up Peel as there are several places to grab a quick snack (Starbucks, La Bete a Pain, Dairy Queen, along with several restaurants), before you continue on your trek along the canal. If you want a healthier option, there is a gym that has a snack counter that makes smoothies and other power drinks.I wish I knew more of the history to share other than this area used to be no mans land but had become an up and coming area if it's not already there with its fabulous food scene and designer interior decor boutiques. It's a beautiful mix of old and new. On one side you have ¬†great views of the famous Farine Five Roses building. Across the canal you have an endless line of condo construction all seeking to outdo the next with amazing amenities. ¬†It's all gorgeous."
"Parc des Compagnons de Saint-Laurent is a-ok! ¬†Not amazing, not horrible either. ¬†Green space is always a good thing, and this park is a welcome oasis on Mont-Royal, just East of Papineau. ¬†Lots of benches, a few picnic tables, and a gigantic communal stone picnic table, make it a great place to stop and savor a croissant from Copains D'abord, a gelato from Peche Glace or even a sausage sandwich from William Walter. ¬†Where we find it a bit lacking is in the play structures: there isn't much variety, and what there is isn't all that fun (at least not to me, nor to my 3yo who isn't so into swings). ¬†But there's sand, and that's a big draw in our family. And during the summer there's the Ludotheque, a shipping crate full of toys to borrow and play with, books to read, and assorted other fun stuff to make up for the play structures that don't get us all that excited."
"La Fontaine is relatively small community park space that has everything for the locals to enjoy active time. Starting with the tennis courts that can be booked through the municipality and swimming pool that operates through the summer months. Then comes the dogs park, which is hidden in between the trees and the boule playground, both areas allowing residents to congregate based on their interests. There are also two playgrounds for the kiddos that were recently renovated. My favorite in the park remains the ice skating rink. It is the traditional outdoor rink, no refrigeration, fully relying on favorable weather conditions. I actually ended up skating once at it and my sweetheart even practiced his hockey skills for an hour. It is relatively well maintained, at night it is illuminated and one can see people playing the favorite Canadian sport quite often. During the day parents brings their little ones for their first ice skating experiences. The park has relatively big parking lot, making the access to all the facilities easy for folks who are not residents of IDS, besides the fact IDS is accessible by public transportation, meaning bus."
"Parc la Fontaine on Nun's Island is nothing remarkable save for the fact that it has a public outdoor swimming pool in Piscine la Fontaine, one of Verdun's 4 public swimming pools and one of only 2 that are open during the summer of covid.This pool is far, far less crowded than the pool at Arthur Thierrien and if you're willing to catch the number 12 bus, you'll be rewarded with a pool that is less crowded, has a small green space and fewer obnoxious ¬†kids and parents. They also have swimming shifts and rotating times like other public pools during covid but because they hardly ever hit their max, you end up staying as long as you want."
"My partner and I went here to play tennis and it was a decent experience and was what we expected, hence the 3 stars.There's a lot of free parking around when we went at about 8pm.There's about six tennis courts and a few basketball courts around.Would love to come back here again."
"This place was so beautiful, the lights and everything.Everyone was happy, especially the kids.You must go!"
"Maybe small kids would like this but we found this so lame -- and I'll give you my reasons. 1. You can't see the gardens at night! Not a one. LIGHT THEM UP!!!2. LOTS of walking in small paths with TOO MANY People as they oversold this. 3. The ""Light Show"" consists of some balloon animals lit up in the pond and lighting along the long and winding paths. Laserium in the '70's was way better and that was corny even back then. 4. Hard to find the bathroom and for such a mob scene -- ONE URINAL and one stall! ¬†Thought it would be in bad taste to pee in the lake. Maybe I'll come back for the actual Gardens as I hear they are nice."
"I really enjoy coming here every few years to experience the Garden Light festival and they have progressively added to the experience by altering some of the light expositions and added new areas.The concept is relatively simple. You show up when it gets dark and you can walk through cornered off sections of the Chinese and Japanese gardens.It gets pretty crowded, I certainly wish they can ""queue up"" people before they enter the exposition. I would prefer to wait 5-10 minutes to walk in so that I can have a clear view of the garden.Otherwise, scenery is beautiful. Buy your tickets online to save time."
"A must-see for me, it's a stroll in the park. But at night. With really colourful lights. In the rain!! How many mud puddles did I step in, I couldn't tell the difference between this dark grassy (super wet) area to the dark leafy (dry) area. The Chinese garden is huge but very slippery in the rain.This happens two months of the year: all of September and all of October. When the sun goes down, the lights are up.The lights are extremely bright and colourful. It's not like traditional Chinese lantern festivals, it's much more modern and child-like. Areas that are lid are:- the path leading into the garden- the entire Chinese garden- all waters of the Chinese garden have lanterns- all corners of the Chinese garden have lanterns- on the rims of buildings and structures- on the trees- on the rocks- the Japanese house beside the Japanese gardenIt's not just a display of 1-2 panda lanterns, each set has its own theme! It's very cute. It gets REALLY dark even with all the lights, because you can't see where you're stepping. Well this was true because I came in the rain.The lanterns over the waters are impressive!!!! So grand!!P.S. I uploaded photos but they're not showing up in this review. So here they are!entranceyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi‚Ä¶Chinese gardenyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi‚Ä¶Chinese garden, omg so magnificentyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi‚Ä¶Japanese houseyelp.ca/biz_photos/jardi‚Ä¶"
"Get there early for parking close by. Buy tickets online ahead of time if you can. If not, get them online from your smart phone to skip the line. If all else fails, the line was really long, but it seemed to move fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad. I really thought this place was going to be really cool to check out, and it was, but it was difficult to enjoy. It was crowded, overly crowded, like they let waaayy too many people in. At times it was hard to see, there was lots of bumping into people. It just really reminded me of a concert atmosphere, except I didn't have a drink in my hand and there was no music. Speaking of which I really felt the whole night could've used some kind of background music, I personally felt it was missing. Maybe thats just me being overly critical.We came a couple weeks ago when it was a really unexpectedly warm night. With the crowds it was a lot of waiting to see the next display, waiting to get to restrooms, and waiting to get to a vendor. It was just so slow moving. The area got warm quick, and all I wanted was some water. The vendors were few and far between, and NO ONE sold water! To top it off there were lots of bugs, and they kept annoying me the whole night. By the time we got close to the end, we were over it. My friend even wanted to take the emergency exit to get out faster. All in all, it was beautiful to see but it was hard to enjoy it. Given the chance again, I'd personally pass, it wasn't worth the hassle to me."
"Beautiful lit scenery using wire and colorful silk amazed us as we walked through the scenery. ¬†Very impressive. ¬† See my pictures!If you are in Montreal, this is a must see ... check dates and times as it is a yearly temporary event."
Totally worth risking standing on line in the cold. Buy tickets in advance online. Also bring student ID for a discounted ticket. Really enjoyed the Chinese garden.
"This is an event that takes place in the Chinese garden inside the Jardin Botanique de Montr√©al. Lanterns of various shapes and sizes are placed all around the gardens and are lit up at night. The Chinese garden is beautiful, and the lanterns add a sort of kitschy appeal. It is included in the admission to the botanical gardens."
"Spectacular! sums it up well.You'll re experience your childhood in this beautiful park and if you have kids they'll love you for bringing them here. There are a also a couple of artwork museums here and there. There will be a lot of walking and amazement along the way. They close the entrance gates after 6 PM, so make sure you park at the correct gates, where you will still be allowed to leave after closing hours.Discount for students and Quebec residents."
"Just in time for the mid-autumn festival is the Garden of Lights. I love it, it's beautiful! Try to come towards the end of the day, so you can see the difference of the garden during the day and night. My only wish is that the bonsai exhibit is open for viewing during night as well."
"Need an idea for a romantic evening in Montreal? Forget the restaurants; head to Jardins de Lumiere, on from late Sept to early Nov at the Jardin Botanique.Every year the Chinese lantern festival gets better and better. This year's display of rainforest plants and animals is amazing. Take your time and enjoy the Chinese garden from all angles. You can even have a cup of jasmine tea and a moon cake to enjoy while sitting near the lake.Since last year, the Japanese garden has been added to the light extravaganza. It's an entirely different experience than the lanterns. Walk around the path but then find a place near the pavilion to sit and watch the lights change.Don't miss it!"
"Go to the Jardins De Lumiere close to 9PM, when the crowds have thinned significantly. I was there at 7PM, and the Jardin Chinoise was at capacity. Besides this minor complaint, it was a very surreal experience. The cold air, the almost surreal placement of the displays (whether it's butterflies, pagodas, or people) and the way it's almost encouraged that you take your time going through each lighted piece.The Jardin Japonais is equally beautiful, albeit in its own way. There's none of the exhibition pieces--instead the whole garden is a dazzling spectacle of lights in different colors and intensities.Allow yourself plenty of time to appreciate the two gardens. It's a wonderful experience."
"Absolutely beautiful! There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when we went to visit, and while we didn't get to see any of the festive lights or seasonal decorations, we did see beautiful, well maintained trees and fresh snow everywhere. ¬†We took a long walk through the park, ended up standing on top of a frozen lake (on purpose) and got to enjoy the cool breeze without many other visitors."
"Small neighborhood park, not far from the Namur metro station, with water games, a play area for toddlers and older children, a community garden, a basketball court and a large field for picnics and improvised soccer or football games."
"This green space behind the metro station has a kids play park, kids pool, a bocce field, baseball field and a skate park. There's also a few picnic tables and benches where people come take a break during lunch. Not particularly well maintained judging from the height of the grass but I stop by for some shade during lunch or my coffee break."
Quiet little park in Pointe-Saint-Charles. Lovely yet humble homes along the perimeter and a great place to quickly walk the dog. Ok place to hang out with the kids: Some small children's play areas nearby and there's a community sports complex and library right next door.Alone: the park is 3 stars.With other amenities (library and complex): 4 stars.
